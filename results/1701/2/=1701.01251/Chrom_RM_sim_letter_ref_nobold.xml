<outline text="Introduction" _note="Transmission spectroscopy is an essential tool for characterising the&#10;atmospheres of transiting exoplanets . demonstrated that narrowband&#10;exoplanet features (e.g. sodium) could be probed by analysing the shape&#10;of the stellar absorption lines as a planet occults its host star, that&#10;is, by studying the chromatic Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect; more&#10;recently have shown that this effect can also be used to probe broadband&#10;signatures (e.g. Rayleigh scattering). Recently, presented a new&#10;technique using (a version of) line-profile tomography, with the intent&#10;of studying chromatic changes in planetary radii. However, we&#10;demonstrate in this Letter that the technique in B16 is unfortunately&#10;flawed.&#10;&#10;In principle, the application of line-profile tomography is well&#10;motivated for exoplanet atmosphere characterisation if correctly&#10;implemented. This technique isolates the starlight behind the planet&#10;during transit , and the ratio of the integrated flux within the local&#10;profile (behind the planet) to the out-of-transit profile is equal to&#10;the brightness of the occulted starlight. In turn, the ratio of the&#10;occulted starlight is dependent on the planet-to-star radius ratio. As&#10;such, if one had space-based spectra then the planet radius could be&#10;recovered from the spectra alone, and doing so in various passbands&#10;would characterise the planetary radius wavelength dependency. For&#10;ground-based spectra this is not possible due to, for example,&#10;transparency variations of the Earth’s atmosphere. To remove these&#10;effects, ground-based spectra must first be continuum normalised; they&#10;can then be multiplied by a transit light curve to allow one to study&#10;the local, occulted stellar profiles directly by subtracting the in-&#10;from out-of-transit observations (see, e.g. ). Since the transit light&#10;curve is dependent on the planet-to-star radius ratio, it sets the&#10;planet radius that is recoverable when examining the brightness ratio&#10;between the local and out-of-transit profiles (meaning one cannot&#10;recover new radius variations following B16).&#10;&#10;In this study, we first break down the physical implications of the B16&#10;technique, and then simulate the planet transit of HD189733b to&#10;illustrate the impact of the technique’s shortcomings on the measured&#10;planet radius; we also reapply the B16 technique to HARPS data, with a&#10;more rigorous error propagation. In Sect. \[sec:calc\], we demonstrate&#10;how the choice of the transit light curve normalisation sets the&#10;recoverable planet radius. We present the simulated planet transits, and&#10;our reanalysis of the HARPS data in Sect. \[sec:sim\_recover\], and show&#10;how an underestimation of the errors can lead to spurious claims of&#10;planetary radius variations. Finally, we summarise our conclusions in&#10;Sect. \[sec:conc\].">

<outline text="Limitations of a brightness-based approach to chromatic exoplanet radii" _note="In B16, the authors attempted to study passband-dependent planet radius&#10;variations by averaging together the cross-correlation functions (CCFs)&#10;for subsets of HARPS spectral orders. All of these CCFs, regardless of&#10;passband, were continuum normalised and then further scaled using a&#10;transit light curve based on the system parameters determined in the&#10;full HARPS passband, except for passband dependent limb darkening&#10;coefficients.&#10;&#10;For each passband, they created master out-of-transit CCFs by averaging&#10;together all the individual out-of-transit CCFs in a given night, and&#10;then subtracting the out- from the in-transit data to obtain CCFs for&#10;the starlight occulted by the planet. The authors then fitted Gaussian&#10;functions to the respective CCFs, presumably to act as a proxy for the&#10;integrated flux within, and argued that the ratio between the areas&#10;(determined from the Gaussian fits) of the local to the out-of-transit&#10;CCFs could serve as a measure of the brightness of the missing&#10;starlight,  , occulted during the in-transit observations.&#10;&#10;The authors then compared this empirical to the expected brightness&#10;ratio based on an approximation to the solution for integrating the&#10;starlight behind the planet given the particular geometry of the system&#10;(and assuming a particular function for the limb darkening). Since this&#10;solution was dependent on the planet radius, the authors argued that&#10;they were able to disentangle a planet radius measurement for each&#10;passband.&#10;&#10;We demonstrate in Sect. \[subsec:tran\] that the technique outlined by&#10;B16 can only recover the planetary radius set by the transit light curve&#10;used in the initial normalisation. However, we emphasise that such a&#10;limitation is set due to a flux-based approach and would not be present&#10;in an RV-based approach, such as that in or that in traditional line&#10;profile tomography (i.e. following the formulation).">
  <outline text="Transit light curve normalisation" _note="B16 started by determining the area of their out-of-transit master CCFs,&#10;, for each passband. Since the out-of-transit master CCFs () were&#10;continuum normalised their area is equal to their equivalent width, ,&#10;that is, The authors also measured the areas of the local CCFs behind&#10;the planet, . Since the in-transit CCFs () are normalised by the transit&#10;light curve, the area of the local CCF ( is where is the flux from the&#10;light curve, is the equivalent width of the local CCF, and is the&#10;fraction of starlight occulted by the planet under the assumptions of&#10;the transit light curve used in the normalisation.&#10;&#10;In an ideal case, where the local stellar photospheric profiles can be&#10;represented by constant Gaussian functions (assumed both above and in&#10;B16), then the only difference between the local and disc-integrated&#10;out-of-transit CCFs is the broadening by stellar rotation present in the&#10;disc-integrated observations. Since the rotational broadening preserves&#10;the equivalent width, then where the and the are not only equal to each&#10;other but are also equal to the in-transit equivalent width, (since it&#10;is simply a summation of local profiles of equal EW), and the ratio of&#10;the areas becomes:&#10;&#10;Hence, under the above assumptions one can only recover the planet&#10;radius injected into the model transit light curve, regardless of which&#10;passband is studied. This is because the transit light curve&#10;normalisation effectively sets the area of the local profile. We note,&#10;that the transit light curve normalisation for the above follows , where&#10;; whereas, the transit light curve normalisation in B16 was (Borsa,&#10;Private Comm.), such that where is the local CCF obtained following C16.&#10;Since the continuum is a free parameter in the Gaussian fits, the ratio&#10;of the areas is still equal to that in Eq. \[eqn:Arat\].&#10;&#10;As such, the technique implemented by B16 represents a circular&#10;argument. Moreover, if one had the broadband photometry necessary for&#10;the correct spectral normalisation, then the planet radii could be&#10;determined directly from the light curves alone.&#10;&#10;We stress that a solely brightness-based approach to transmission&#10;spectroscopy uses only the equivalent width, and therefore precludes any&#10;retrieval of information on exoplanet radii. It is the inclusion of the&#10;spectral dimension that is necessary to determine (i.e. utilising the&#10;Doppler information, as is done in ).">

<outline text="Systematic effects on chromatic radius measurements" _note="To try to understand how B16 obtained results mimicking Rayleigh&#10;scattering, we simulated the transit of HD189733b and applied their&#10;technique. To demonstrate that we could recover our model inputs, we&#10;also present results wherein we applied the normalisation from C16 with&#10;the correct planet radii for each passband; in doing so we discovered&#10;the approximations for in B16 underestimated the planet radii, and thus&#10;we also explored a numerical approach for calculating this brightness&#10;ratio that was more accurate than the approximation used in B16.">
  <outline text="Analytical brightness ratio approximation" _note="Unfortunately, integrating the limb darkened brightness underneath a&#10;planet lying off stellar disc centre is not straightforward and even&#10;approximate analytical expressions are quite complex (especially if&#10;considering ingress and egress regions). For this reason, B16 used the&#10;formalism presented in , which was based on the analytical&#10;approximations of for the RM effect. Therein the brightness ratio for a&#10;fully in-transit planet (i.e. no ingress or egress regions were&#10;considered) was defined, under the standard linear limb darkening law,&#10;as:&#10;&#10;where is the stellar radius, is the planet radius, is the linear limb&#10;darkening coefficient, and is the centre-to-limb planet position. We&#10;note that , where is the centre-to-limb angle, and is the centre of the&#10;planet . We also note that state that the accuracy of this approximation&#10;diminishes with increasing , arguing that the additional terms in the&#10;analytical solution contribute to 1% if is 0.1 and up to few percent if&#10;. Given that is only predicted to vary a few precent in wavelength for&#10;particular atmospheric characteristics, such as Rayleigh scattering,&#10;this approximation may inject systematic errors that could be&#10;misinterpreted as having a physical origin (even if the light curve&#10;normalisation is done correctly).">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Numerical brightness ratio approximation" _note="To investigate the impact of the accuracy of Eq. \[eqn:beta\], we&#10;decided to calculate numerically. For this approach, the in-transit&#10;starlight blocked by the planet is still defined as , with and defined&#10;as the fluxes of the total stellar disc and the stellar disc under the&#10;planet, respectively. Note the observed brightness of the un-occulted&#10;star can be analytically determined by integrating a given limb&#10;darkening law over the projected stellar disc; for a linear limb&#10;darkening this is&#10;&#10; where is the azimuthal angle. As previously stated, calculating the&#10;flux behind the planet analytically is not trivial. Hence, we calculated&#10;numerically by constructing a square stellar grid with a width of&#10;centred about the planet position (), with equal steps in the vertical&#10;and horizontal direction. Contributions from steps that did not lie&#10;beneath the planet and/or on the stellar disc were excluded. Thus, we&#10;approximated the flux behind the planet as where is the limb darkened&#10;intensity at a given position in the aforementioned grid and is the&#10;corresponding area.&#10;&#10;Our aim was to try to recover as a function of wavelength, wherein the&#10;injected was only used to construct the correct light curves (acting as&#10;if we had simultaneous multi-colour photometry). Hence, when trying to&#10;recover , we started with the broadband planet radius and then allowed&#10;it to vary by up to in steps of 0.0001. The recovered planet radius then&#10;corresponded to the planet radii that minimised the difference between&#10;and .">

  <outline text="Simulated star-planet system" _note="We used the simulated stellar grid of and injected into each grid cell a&#10;Gaussian profile with a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 5 km s (note&#10;this width is similar to the expected value for the stellar&#10;photosphere). In the simulated star we did not consider any&#10;astrophysical effects (i.e. granulation or starspots etc.) other than&#10;rigid body stellar rotation, which was set to the value obtained by C16,&#10;3.25 km s. We also assumed an edge-on () aligned orbit.&#10;&#10;The transit was sampled in 21 equal steps in phase from , centred about&#10;mid-transit, with an additional sample at phase = 0.03 to serve as a&#10;completely out-of-transit reference. We simulated a transit for each of&#10;the seven passbands (from  nm) used in B16, and applied a linear limb&#10;darkening using the coefficients (for each passband) these authors&#10;provided. For each of the seven passband transits we injected a planet&#10;with a constant radius equal to the value assumed by B16 for the whole&#10;HARPS passband (, hereafter referred to as the broadband ), but varied&#10;the limb darkening accordingly.&#10;&#10;For this set of transits, we tested the impact of the transit light&#10;curve normalisation. In the first case, we followed the procedure in&#10;B16, and in the second case we normalised the data following C16 and&#10;used the numerical approximation in Sect. \[subsec:numerical\] to&#10;estimate . Examining the first case allowed us to examine any errors&#10;introduced using the approximation and/or the B16 normalisation. On the&#10;other hand, the second case offered a test case to ensure we could&#10;recover the model inputs.&#10;&#10;For a second test, we repeated the above, but varied the radius of the&#10;simulated planet; for this we selected equal to the values reported by&#10;B16 for each passband. Again we tested two cases: first following the&#10;B16 procedure (where the light curve limb darkening varies in each&#10;passband, but the light curve radius remains fixed at the broadband ),&#10;and the second using the C16 normalisation (we note the assumed light&#10;curve has the correct here) and the numerical approximation in&#10;Sect. \[subsec:numerical\].">
    <outline text="Obtaining the planet radius and systematic errors" _note="We examined the recovered as a function of stellar disc position, and&#10;found only a slight dependance on disc position when following B16.&#10;However, if one point each at the ingress and egress regions were&#10;included then the dependence on disc position was strong, and including&#10;such data would systematically decrease the recovered (as the&#10;formulation is not valid in these regions).&#10;&#10;Moreover, we found that, regardless of the B16 or C16 normalisation,&#10;using the approximation always underestimated the limb darkening behind&#10;the planet and therefore also underestimated the true planet radius.&#10;This is because the analytical approximation assumes the limb darkening&#10;behind the planet is constant, and equal to the value behind the centre&#10;of the planet. In reality, the stellar photosphere behind the planet&#10;exhibits a range of limb darkening. This is why the numerical model in&#10;Sect. \[subsec:numerical\] is necessary to recover the injected into the&#10;simulated data.&#10;&#10;The reported in B16 comes from averaging together the planet radii&#10;recovered across the stellar disc. If the limb darkening effects are&#10;sufficiently removed (and the stellar profile is constant), then this&#10;provides a good means to boost the signal-to-noise in the reported . In&#10;Fig. \[fig:Rp\_wl\], we present the average recovered as a function of&#10;wavelength from the simulations, for both tests (when was constant and&#10;when it varied). As expected from Sect. \[subsec:tran\], the B16&#10;procedure always results in nearly the same , regardless of whether the&#10;true varied or not.&#10;&#10;For our numerical approach and the C16 normalisation, we demonstrate&#10;accurate recovery of (regardless of whether or not we include ingress&#10;and egress data), but only if the light curve normalisation is done with&#10;the correct for each passband (using the broadband for all passbands&#10;meant only the broadband was recovered). Hence, regardless of the&#10;normalisation (i.e. B16 or C16) or the brightness formulation (i.e. or&#10;our numerical approximation), we could only retrieve the parameters&#10;injected into the system via the transit light curve normalisation, as&#10;expected from Sect. \[sec:calc\].">

  <outline text="Reanalysis of the HARPS data" _note="Our application of the B16 procedure on the simulated data cannot&#10;explain the wavelength-dependent planet radii reported in B16. To&#10;further investigate this aspect, and to ensure we have applied the B16&#10;method correctly, we have reanalysed the same three transits of&#10;HD189733b following their technique, but using the Levenberg-Marquardt&#10;least-squares minimisation from `MPFIT` rather than `IDL`’s&#10;`GAUSSFIT`[^1]. The results are plotted in Fig. \[fig:Rp\_wl\_data\],&#10;alongside those from B16[^2]. We demonstrate we can reproduce (red&#10;points in Fig. \[fig:Rp\_wl\_data\]) results in 1-2 agreement with B16&#10;(in green); hence, we are confident we have applied their technique&#10;properly (in both the simulated and observed data). However, we argue&#10;that with the correct treatment of the uncertainties the recovered&#10;planet radii (in black) are consistent with a flat line (within of the&#10;mean recovered in the simulated data, i.e. the solid black points in&#10;Fig. \[fig:Rp\_wl\]), as expected from Sect. \[sec:calc\]. We believe&#10;the reason B16 report a trend with wavelength, and we do not, is largely&#10;due to differences in our error analysis and Gaussian fitting&#10;techniques.&#10;&#10;In B16, the recovered for each stellar disc position and all three&#10;transits were averaged together to provide one for each passband, and&#10;the reported errors came from the rms of these individual planet radii&#10;(i.e. the standard deviation divided by the square root of the total&#10;number in the passband). In our analysis, we report the weighted mean&#10;for each passband, with the weights being the inverse square of the&#10;error for each individual planet radii (where the error was calculated&#10;by propagating the errors on the CCF areas as reported from the Gaussian&#10;fits following C16, and assuming negligible error on the limb darkening&#10;and stellar disc positions). The error on the weighted mean then was&#10;simply the square root of the inverse sum of the weights squared. If the&#10;errors on individual were all exactly equal to the standard deviation,&#10;then the two approaches would yield the same result.&#10;&#10;In addition to this slight difference in error analysis, B16 also&#10;applied their Gaussian fits to the oversampled CCF grid provided by the&#10;HARPS pipeline (Borsa, Private Comm.). We caution against such an&#10;approach, as the oversampling will lead to a significant underestimation&#10;of the errors. Hence, we also fit Gaussians to data composed of every&#10;one in four points from the original CCFs (to compensate for the&#10;original sampling rate of 0.25kms for a mean pixel width of 0.82kms);&#10;these results are shown in black in Fig. \[fig:Rp\_wl\_data\].&#10;&#10;\[tab:bestfit\]&#10;&#10;To test the significance of a trend in with wavelength, we fitted the&#10;data with both a flat line and a linear regression, and calculated the&#10;reduced chi-squared, , and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC); the&#10;results are shown in Table \[tab:bestfit\]. We note that even if a&#10;wavelength-dependent is found, it does not confirm the B16 technique is&#10;valid, as we have already shown it is not mathematically possible to&#10;retrieve radius variations. Rather, it would serve as a red flag that we&#10;do not fully characterise the interplay of the various complexities&#10;present in the observations. In particular, stellar activity can alter&#10;the observed stellar line shapes and their equivalent widths – which in&#10;turn could lead to spurious radius variations following&#10;Sect. \[sec:calc\]. Since HD189733 is a known active star this is likely&#10;scenario; and in agreement with Fig. 5 from B16, wherein the single&#10;night analysis with the most apparent slope, July 2007, is also the most&#10;magnetically active . Moreover (and as noted by B16), have argued that&#10;the apparent wavelength dependency in their independent observations of&#10;this system are best explained by un-occulted starspots rather than the&#10;planet atmosphere.&#10;&#10;When using the oversampled CCFs, both our analysis and B16’s indicate a&#10;slight improvement in fit for the model with a wavelength-dependent&#10;slope. However, we find a much worse fit to the data than that found&#10;with the B16 results. The high from our reanalysis indicates an&#10;underestimation of the uncertainty in the data, as one would expect when&#10;using the oversampled CCFs. We cannot explain the very low for the B16&#10;wavelength-dependent fit, which indicates the model is overfitting the&#10;data. We note these tests were only performed on our reanalysis of the&#10;oversampled data for comparison with B16; for our conclusions on the&#10;best-fit, we refer the reader to the analysis on the CCFs sampled every&#10;one in four points.&#10;&#10;For the properly sampled dataset, we found only a marginal improvement&#10;in the fit for the wavelength-dependent model, and do not deem this&#10;improvement to be statistically significant (see Table \[tab:bestfit\]).&#10;Moreover, the best-fit flat model ( = 0.1569 0.0003) lies within 3 of&#10;the mean predicted by the simulations. The slight improvement for the&#10;sloped model is also heavily influenced by only a couple data points&#10;from a single transit, in August 2007, as shown in the subplot of&#10;Fig. \[fig:Rp\_wl\_data\]. If the best-fit model is robust, it should&#10;withstand removing the August transit; however, doing so means the data&#10;is then best-fit by a flat line ( = 1.6, BIC = 11.1 and = 1.7, BIC =&#10;12.6 for flat and sloped line, respectively). Consequently, we believe&#10;B16 likely report a wavelength-dependent trend in due to insufficient&#10;error analysis, and that its agreement with the literature may be purely&#10;coincidental.&#10;&#10;[^1]: `MPFIT` did not produce significantly different results compared&#10;    to `IDL`’s `GAUSSFIT`, but it did allow us to propagate our errors&#10;    more thoroughly (see C16 for details).&#10;&#10;[^2]: We note that we used the same transit parameters as B16, but there&#10;    is a slight difference in the template mask used to obtain the CCFs.&#10;    B16 used the archival data available from the ESO website, where 2&#10;    nights used the G2 mask and 1 night used the K5 mask, whereas our&#10;    data always used the K5 mask. However, this difference is unlikely&#10;    to impact the analysis since each night had its own master .">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="We outline our conclusions on a point-by-point basis below.&#10;&#10;The technique presented in B16 using the ratio of the areas of the local&#10;(starlight behind the planet) to the out-of-transit CCF cannot be used&#10;to determine , as must be known a priori for the transit light curve&#10;normalisation required for ground-based spectra. This is shown both&#10;analytically and using a simulated star-planet system.&#10;&#10;The analytical approximation used in B16 also introduces (slight)&#10;systematic trends with planet position due to inadequately accounting&#10;for limb darkening and fractional area occultation effects, and&#10;underestimates the value of .&#10;&#10;We postulate that the variations reported in B16 are likely due to&#10;underestimated errors (largely originating from use of oversampled&#10;CCFs), as our reanalysis of the HD189733b transits further demonstrates&#10;that the only recoverable is that injected into the transit light curve&#10;normalisation.&#10;&#10;Chromatic RM measurements from ground-based spectra are not possible&#10;without taking the Doppler information into account. Hence, for future&#10;measurements, we advise readers to either follow the works of or to&#10;apply the line-profile tomography of directly on each spectral passband.&#10;&#10;We thank the referees, I. A. G.
