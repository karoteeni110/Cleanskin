<outline text="Introduction" _note="Let us start by defining the model. On the integer line we sample&#10;independently for each site two independent variables and uniformly in&#10;the set . We interpret (resp. ) as being a parenthesis: an opening&#10;parenthesis for and closing one for living on the upper half-plane&#10;(resp. lower half-plane). By pairing the parentheses, it is then&#10;standard that yields a perfect matching on , i.e. an involution of&#10;without fixed points. This matching is furthermore planar, meaning that&#10;we can draw arcs between paired points so that the arcs are non&#10;crossing. In most of the following drawings, these arcs will be tents or&#10;semi-circles. We repeat this construction twice, once with the&#10;parentheses of the upper half plane, and once in lower half plane. After&#10;gluing the top and bottom arches on points of we are left with a random&#10;(multi)graph with many infinite clusters (actually bi-infinite paths).&#10;&#10;Either almost surely or almost surely.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, we have not been able to decide which of the two&#10;alternatives actually holds and leave this as an open question. Before&#10;moving to the proof, let us present a few motivations for studying this&#10;model, except of course of its intrinsic beauty, see&#10;Figures \[fig:intro\] and \[fig:one\_cycle\].">
  <outline text="&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;Random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity&lt;/span&gt;." _note="In the last decades, the geometry of random uniform planar graphs (or&#10;maps) has been studied intensively and is now quite well understood .&#10;The large scale structure of DECORATED planar maps is much less&#10;understood and virtually nothing is rigorously known on the asymptotic&#10;geometry of these objects. One of the simplest model is that of&#10;triangulations given with a spanning tree. Upon cutting along the&#10;spanning tree, such a triangulation can be seen as a binary tree of&#10;triangles and an “outside” planar matching. If we further blow this tree&#10;of triangles we end up with a discrete cycle with two systems of&#10;non-crossing arches (both counted by Catalan numbers), an outside one&#10;identifying pairs of edges and an inside one connecting points. See&#10;Figure \[fig:trig\].&#10;&#10;Hence our model can be seen as a (infinite) simplified version of the&#10;above construction where the two systems of arches play a symmetric&#10;role. We hope that the insight we get in studying our model will be&#10;useful to understand the geometry of tree-decorated maps. In the&#10;continuous setting, the idea to glue a pair of random trees (which can&#10;be seen as continuous limit of planar perfect matchings) appears in the&#10;construction of the Brownian map and in Liouville quantum gravity .">

  <outline text="&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;Meanders&lt;/span&gt;." _note="A meander is a self-avoiding closed loop crossing a horizontal line,&#10;seen up to topological equivalence, i.e. up to a homeomorphism of the&#10;plane preserving the horizontal line. In our model, this correspond to&#10;gluing two (finite) planar perfect matchings so that the resulting graph&#10;is connected, in other words, the finite clusters in our graph are&#10;meanders. The (asymptotic) enumeration of meanders is a notorious&#10;difficult open problem in combinatorics and in theoretical physics, see&#10;. Our model in contrast allows the explicit computation of several&#10;quantities; let us mention for instance that the expected number of&#10;circles, i.e. length 2 clusters, going around or passing through a given&#10;vertex, turns out to have the surprisingly simple value .&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;Proof sketch&lt;/span&gt;." _note="The proof resembles the Burton-Keane argument for percolation. We first&#10;note that is constant a.s. due to ergodicity. We then discard the case&#10;(infinity included) by a trifurcation argument. The argument does not&#10;apply to the paths themselves, of course, but to the space between them&#10;(here planarity is crucial). This argument is presented in&#10;\[sec:trifu\]. The argument that precludes the case is a local&#10;modification argument, but is complicated by the fact that, in fact, a&#10;local modification cannot change the number of infinite paths. It can,&#10;however, wire them differently i.e. make a new path by joining the tails&#10;of two existing paths (after some parity issues are resolved). In&#10;\[sec:rewire\] we explain why this is enough.&#10;&#10;As already stated, we believe that . In fact, we believe this holds in&#10;much greater generality, here is the precise formulation:&#10;&#10;Let be a random matching of (not necessarily planar), stationary and&#10;ergodic with respect to the action of translation by , for every . Let&#10;be a second matching of , also stationary and ergodic to the action of&#10;all translations. Assume and are independent (but not necessarily&#10;identically distributed). Let be the random graph whose vertex set is&#10;and edge set is the union of and . Then does not have a UNIQUE infinite&#10;cluster, almost surely.">

<outline text="Finite configurations" _note="Let be our set of configurations, and let us consider a random variable&#10;in , where and are independent sequences of i.i.d. random variables with&#10;uniform distribution in . We denote by (resp. ) the edges belonging to&#10;the upper (resp. lower) planar perfect matching. For we write for the&#10;cluster of containing . Knowing the restriction of the configuration to&#10;a finite interval amounts to knowing a finite sub-graph of plus the&#10;orientation of edges exiting the inverval (i.e., the fact that they&#10;leave the interval toward the left or right). Let us introduce some&#10;notation and properties regarding this situation, which will be useful&#10;in order to make “local” modifications of . Note indeed that changing in&#10;such a finite interval may have global consequences on , unless the&#10;location of the out-going edges is preserved. Thanks to translation&#10;invariance, we consider here integer intervals of the form , where ,&#10;without loss of generality.&#10;&#10;For , we shall denote the set of configurations on by Let , and . Let us&#10;complete into by letting for all and for all ; we may then define the&#10;graph as before, and define the numbers of edges outgoing through the&#10;top left and top right (see Figure \[fig:ends\_circle\_in\]): and&#10;similarly and using , for the lower part, and the total number of&#10;boundary edges: We shall sometimes call these edges “dangling ends”, or&#10;ends, of . These edges are non-crossing and all of them start inside and&#10;end outside the circle of diameter (for any disjoint embedding). Thus,&#10;they have a natural cyclic ordering, given by the order on this circle&#10;of their last intersection points (or of their ONLY intersection, for&#10;the embeddings mentioned in the beginning). Let us number them from to&#10;starting for instance from the bottommost top left outgoing edge and&#10;following the clockwise order. By associating the two ends of each&#10;connected component in to each other, defines a non-crossing matching of&#10;; we shall say that REALISES .&#10;&#10;Conversely, any non-crossing matching can be realised with any&#10;prescribed numbers of ends provided some room is allowed and the&#10;necessary parity conditions hold:&#10;&#10;\[lem:local\_config\] Let be an integer. For any nonnegative integers&#10;such that , and have same parity, and such that , and for any&#10;non-crossing matching , there exists a configuration such that and that&#10;realises .&#10;&#10;Note that the parity assumptions are necessary conditions for the&#10;conclusion to hold: since the vertices, together with the upper ends are&#10;paired by , their total number has to be even, and similarly for the&#10;lower ends.&#10;&#10;Let us first construct a configuration that realises using at most two&#10;vertices for each matched pair, disregarding the value of . We will now&#10;describe the construction verbally, but the reader is probably better&#10;served by simply checking Figure \[fig:exemple\_matching\]. We realise&#10;every horizontal path (i.e. one that starts on the left and ends on the&#10;right) with both ends above the line by a shape, every horizontal path&#10;with both ends below the line by a shape, and horizontal below-to-above&#10;and above-to-below (only one kind may exist, by planarity), by&#10;diagonals. Each ’V’ shape uses two vertices, and each diagonal one.&#10;Paths starting and ending on the same side (left or right) are then&#10;inserted between these, in order of containment, with above-to-above and&#10;below-to-below inserted as diagonal strips (each using two vertices) and&#10;above-to-below as a or (each using one vertex).&#10;&#10;This construction uses a maximum total of vertices. Thus, this&#10;construction can be fitted inside and leaves one free interval provided&#10;we used vertices that are next to each other. Furthermore, the number of&#10;used vertices is easily seen to have same parity as , hence the&#10;remaining number of vertices has to be even due to the assumptions,&#10;which enables making a series of short loops to complete the&#10;configuration in .&#10;&#10;\[lem:size\_boundary\] Almost surely, the number of ends going out of is&#10;negligible compared to :&#10;&#10;If for we introduce and similarly for then and are independent simple&#10;random walks and we have hence the conclusion comes from the law of&#10;large numbers.&#10;&#10;Finally, the following classical lemma controls probabilities after a&#10;local modification .&#10;&#10;\[lem:finite\_energy\] Let be a finite subset of , and be a mapping&#10;(recall the notation from (\[def\_omegaS\])). For any event , define ,&#10;where, for , Then .&#10;&#10;Note indeed that where is independent of , and is uniform in , hence .">

<outline text="Trifurcations" _note="In this section we prove that almost surely. The proof adapts Burton and&#10;Keane’s classical argument based on an appropriate notion of&#10;multifurcation. Let us first, for , consider the first infinite cluster&#10;straddling over , if it exists: and if there is no such cluster (it&#10;actually exists a.s. but we don’t need this fact), and define similarly&#10;below , using .&#10;&#10;In the following definition is the distance in of the point to a set .&#10;&#10;A point is called a **trifurcation point** if it belongs to the&#10;following set :&#10;&#10;Notice that our definition is a bit more subtle than asking that&#10;infinite clusters come nearby . Roughly speaking we do not want that one&#10;cluster separates the two-others. The need for our definition should&#10;become clearer in the proof of the following lemma.&#10;&#10;\[lem:trifurcation\_point\] For any , where denotes a path of our graph&#10;.&#10;&#10;Let us view the paths as embedded in and compactify by adding a point at&#10;infinity thus changing the bi-infinite lines into simple closed curves&#10;of the topological sphere that are disjoint except for the point . The&#10;proof revolves around an auxiliary planar graph , constructed as&#10;follows. The vertices of are the faces of this embedding i.e. regions of&#10;whose boundary is a union of paths , and two vertices are connected in&#10;if they share a path (infinite, intersecting ) as a boundary. Jordan’s&#10;theorem and the fact that the paths intersect only at ensures that every&#10;path is incident to exactly two faces, i.e. that is indeed a graph.&#10;&#10;We first note that is a tree. This follows from the fact that its dual&#10;graph, which is a set of loops based on the same vertex, admits a&#10;spanning tree with one vertex and zero edges, and from  (the spanning&#10;trees of the dual of a planar graph are the complements of the&#10;edge-duals of spanning trees of ).&#10;&#10;Let now be some vertex of and let be a collection of edges of incident&#10;to , or in other words, infinite paths contained in the boundary of the&#10;face (not necessarily all of them). Denote by the set of such that .&#10;&#10;We now claim that . We prove this by induction on . For there is nothing&#10;to prove as a trifurcation requires . Assume therefore that and that is&#10;some trifurcation point that belongs to . Consider the vertical segment&#10;in passing through and whose upper and lower extremities are the first&#10;intersections with and respectively (here and below we write as a short&#10;for ). See figure \[fig:topo\_trif\]. By the definition of , intersects&#10;no other infinite , in particular no other . Thus dissects the face into&#10;three disjoint parts. For example, one of them has as boundary the part&#10;of up to the top of , the part of in the top half plane, and then the&#10;part of up to (and possibly some paths in ). Let be the collection of&#10;paths of which compose the boundaries of these three parts. By the&#10;construction, only and may belong to more than one of and each belongs&#10;to exactly two, so . Further, each , other than itself, must belong to&#10;one of the . Applying the claim inductively to we get as needed.&#10;&#10;To conclude, let be the number of edges of , and let be the number of&#10;vertices. Since is a tree and then where for the collection of all paths&#10;forming the boundary of , and the last inequality is from the previous&#10;discussion. Since there is at least one , the lemma is proved.&#10;&#10;Let us justify that trifurcation points may indeed occur if there are at&#10;least 3 infinite clusters.&#10;&#10;\[lem:positive\_trifurcation\] Assume almost surely. Then .&#10;&#10;Assume almost surely. For , let us consider the event that at least 3&#10;infinite clusters meet and that the edge-boundary of has size at most in&#10;, i.e. . The probability of this event goes to 1 as due to&#10;Lemma \[lem:size\_boundary\], hence we may choose such that . In order&#10;to conclude, let us show that, on , by changing the configuration inside&#10;appropriately, we can obtain a trifurcation point at 0 or at 1.&#10;&#10;Recall that encodes a perfect matching over , see Figure&#10;\[fig:ends\_circle\_in\]. Similarly the outside configuration encodes on&#10;another (planar) matching. However this matching is not anymore perfect&#10;since any infinite cluster of touching will be split into exactly two&#10;semi-infinite paths corresponding to two vertices of that are unmatched&#10;(the breaking of the infinite path by restriciting to might also create&#10;finite paths, but these correspond to pairs in the matching). On the&#10;event , we thus have points with that correspond to the two&#10;semi-infinite lines coming for each cluster touching . We first claim&#10;that and are all EVEN. Indeed, inbetween two consecutive vertices and&#10;the exterior configuration realises a planar perfect matching and so the&#10;number of vertices involved must be even.&#10;&#10;We will now modify the inside configuration in order to induce a perfect&#10;matching on which pairs , and and all the other points to their&#10;neighbour. We want to do that in such a way that the three infinite&#10;clusters and coming from the pairing of have a trifurcation point either&#10;at or at .&#10;&#10;Depending on the number of ends of infinite paths on the left and right&#10;of , we may reduce (up to horizontal symmetry) to one of the&#10;configurations in the top part of Figure \[fig:pair\_infinite\], where&#10;we only depict six ends of semi-infinite paths.&#10;&#10;Depending on the location of the infinite paths, the bottom part of&#10;Figure \[fig:pair\_infinite\] depicts how one sets the configuration&#10;around 0 (notice in figure the numbers which indicate which external&#10;edge connects to which local point) — due a parity constraint, it may in&#10;fact be later necessary to shift the picture by 1, see below. Then one&#10;can accomodate for the finite clusters between the ends of infinite&#10;paths and for the other infinite clusters, in a way similar to&#10;Lemma \[lem:local\_config\] except that it may be necessary to introduce&#10;turns to the semi-infinite paths (i.e. to choose the configuration at&#10;some more vertices), depending whether each end lies on the top or&#10;bottom part, as sketched in Figure \[fig:bending\] in the case of two&#10;neighbouring infinite paths and readily extended to a larger number (up&#10;to four may be needed).&#10;&#10;In this way, we set so far the configuration at some vertices around 0&#10;so that, disregarding the other vertices, the ends at the boundary of&#10;are connected as wished, and . In this construction, we could choose to&#10;use vertices around 0 without leaving empty space between them.&#10;&#10;This procedure uses a number of vertices that has same parity as (or&#10;equivalently as ). Since is even (cf. Lemma \[lem:local\_config\]&#10;above), the number of yet unsettled vertices inside is even. Up to a&#10;possible translation of the previously set configuration by 1, which&#10;would produce a trifurcation point at 1, we may thus assume that the&#10;numbers of unsettled vertices on the right and on the left of 0 are both&#10;even. We then complete the configuration in by length-two loops () in&#10;the empty space. See Figure \[fig:exemple\_trifu\] for an example.&#10;&#10;Matching two neighbouring ends of finite paths requires at most 2&#10;vertices, and matching two ends of semi-infinite paths according to the&#10;previous rule requires at most 6 vertices. The fact that the number of&#10;ends is smaller that (from the definition of ) implies that there is&#10;indeed room for the construction.&#10;&#10;Thus, on the event , there is indeed a modification of the configuration&#10;within that leads to a configuration in . Since , the finite energy&#10;property (Lemma \[lem:finite\_energy\]) enables to conclude that , hence&#10;by translation invariance, which proves the lemma.&#10;&#10;Let us now prove that almost surely. Assume by contradiction that almost&#10;surely. Since the random subset is translation invariant and , it&#10;follows from the ergodic theorem that where the lower bound is&#10;Lemma \[lem:positive\_trifurcation\]. However,&#10;Lemma \[lem:trifurcation\_point\] implies that, for all , is larger than&#10;the number of infinite clusters that are involved in these trifurcations&#10;points; and, by the definition of , these clusters all meet , and&#10;therefore contribute to at least twice as many edges in the boundary of&#10;in . In particular, the size of the boundary of in grows linearly in .&#10;This contradicts Lemma \[lem:size\_boundary\].">

<outline text="The number of paths is not 2." _note="In order to complete the proof of our main result, we have to rule out&#10;the possibility of which is the goal of this section.&#10;&#10;Assume by contradiction that almost surely. Let us denote the two&#10;infinite paths by and ; for instance, we can choose indices so that is&#10;closer to than (equality cannot happen for parity reasons).&#10;&#10;For any integers , define the event that both clusters meet : and for&#10;any integer , let be the event that the boundary of in has size smaller&#10;than : Since and as (by Lemma \[lem:size\_boundary\]), we may take to be&#10;such that With established, let us pick such that For any integer , let&#10;be the maximum distance from reached by a path in starting in before&#10;coming back to for the first time (and if no path comes back). Since&#10;this distance is finite, there exists such that Let us finally define&#10;the event and note already that Let us justify that, on the event , it&#10;is possible to modify the configuration inside in such a way that the&#10;event is no longer satisfied.&#10;&#10;Assume holds. Due to , the infinite cluster decomposes into one finite&#10;path that starts and ends in and two semi-infinite paths that start in&#10;and do not visit again (by cutting the arbitrarily oriented path at its&#10;very first and last visits in ). Due to the finite path does not visit&#10;and due to , exactly one of the semi-infinite paths does. The same holds&#10;for . We now claim that, by modifying the configuration in it is&#10;possible to connect together the ends of these two semi-infinite paths&#10;starting in and not visiting , without changing these semi-infinite&#10;paths outside ; this results in not holding anymore since one of the two&#10;infinite clusters is not visiting .&#10;&#10;The possibility of such a modification comes from&#10;Lemma \[lem:local\_config\], whose applicability is granted by the event&#10;and the combination of the following two facts:&#10;&#10;due to planarity of the paths, if exactly 4 semi-infinite paths exit ,&#10;and only two of them meet , then these two can’t separate the other two&#10;(denoted and ) in and therefore, by planarity again, each of these pairs&#10;is separated by an even number of ends along the boundary of ;&#10;&#10;if two ends are separated by an even number of ends, then there exists&#10;clearly a non-crossing matching that matches to .&#10;&#10;Therefore Lemma \[lem:local\_config\] indeed applies to find a&#10;configuration that maintains the values of and and matches to .&#10;&#10;Let us now conclude. Applying Lemma \[lem:finite\_energy\] to the&#10;previously described modification, we get, by , . This contradicts the&#10;fact that and are disjoint, since that event has probability at least .">
