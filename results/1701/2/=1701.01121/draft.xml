    <title>[HERSCHEL]{} and [HUBBLE]{} study of a lensed massive dusty starbursting
galaxy at</title>
    <abstract>We present the results of combined deep Keck/NIRC2, [HST]{}/WFC3
near-infrared and [HERSCHEL]{} far infrared observations of an extremely
star forming dusty lensed galaxy identified from the [ HERSCHEL]{}
Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey ([H]{}-ATLAS
J133542.9+300401). The galaxy is gravitationally lensed by a massive
WISE identified galaxy cluster at . The lensed galaxy is
spectroscopically confirmed at from detection of by GBT and from
detection of obtained with CARMA. We use the combined spectroscopic and
imaging observations to construct a detailed model of the background
dusty lensed sub-millemter galaxy (SMG) which allows us to study the
source plane properties of the target. The best-fit lens model provide
magnification of and for the stellar and dust components respectively.
Multi-band data yields a magnification corrected star formation rate of
and stellar mass of consistent with a main sequence of star formation at
. The CO observations yield a molecular gas mass of , similar to the
most massive star-forming galaxies, which together with the high
star-formation efficiency are responsible for the intense observed star
formation rates. The lensed SMG has a very short gas depletion time
scale of Myr. The high stellar mass and small gas fractions observed
indicate that the lensed SMG likely has already formed most of its
stellar mass and could be a progenitor of the most massive elliptical
galaxies found in the local Universe. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Understanding the formation of galaxies and their subsequent evolution&#10;with cosmic time are fundamental goals of observational astronomy.&#10;Galaxies are believed to form in gas-rich environments and assemble&#10;their mass through constant gas accretion in secular evolutions ,&#10;mergers or both . The evolutionary track of galaxies is accompanied by&#10;various phases of star formation which could be triggered by events such&#10;as mergers and sustained by processes such as gas accretion onto the&#10;potential wells of the underlying dark matter halos . Studying the&#10;physical processes responsible for regulating star-formation is crucial&#10;in getting a better understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .&#10;&#10;One of the main sites of star formation in the Universe at high&#10;redshifts are sub-millimeter galaxies (for a recent review see: ). These&#10;system are rich in gas and dust and have measured star formation rates&#10;in excess of hundreds to a few thousand solar masses per year . These&#10;dusty galaxies are readily identified and studied in extra-galactic&#10;surveys at long wavelengths at which they are most luminous as the UV&#10;light emitted by the hot young stars (produced by intense star-formation&#10;activity) is absorbed and re-radiated by dust.&#10;&#10;Recent studies indicate a very rapid mass assembly and short duty cycles&#10;(starburst phase) for the high redshift SMGs with time scales as short&#10;as . The high star formation rate is responsible for mass build-up in&#10;SMGs. In fact, cosmological hydrodynamic simulations show that the SMGs&#10;are on average very massive and reside in halos at . This agrees with&#10;multi-band observations of sub-millimeter samples of galaxies at similar&#10;redshifts with stellar masses as high as few times and median of . The&#10;rapid mass assembly in SMGs over short time scales followed by gas&#10;reservoir depletion due to intense star-formation could possibly explain&#10;the origin of the most massive quiescent galaxies. In fact recent&#10;studies have shown that the very high redshift SMGs could indeed be the&#10;progenitors of the most massive quiescent systems . A better&#10;understanding of the mass assembly and the underlying star formation&#10;responsible for it is achieved with the knowledge of the full spectral&#10;energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy. Given the amounts of dust,&#10;these systems are intrinsically faint at shorter wavelengths and become&#10;bright at longer wavelengths. Even with intrinsic luminosities of&#10;identifications of sub-millimeter galaxies at high redshifts are still&#10;challenging. Gravitational lensing provides a unique tool to study this&#10;obscured population of galaxies at high redshift. The signal boost&#10;provided by gravitational lensing and the increase in spatial resolution&#10;combined with robust lens modeling allow us to study the star forming&#10;regions within these galaxies at sub-kpc scales . In fact this tool has&#10;been successfully utilized in several recent works to study the physical&#10;properties of gas-rich star forming systems at high redshift .&#10;&#10;Wide-area far-infrared surveys have been very successful in detecting&#10;lensed sub-millimeter galaxies. The steep number counts and the negative&#10;-correction at sub-mm wavelengths give rise to a high magnification bias&#10;such that the fraction of lensed sources brighter than a given threshold&#10;is significantly larger than other wavelengths . This has been used by&#10;several recent studies to identify samples of high redshift lensed SMGs&#10;from [HERSCHEL]{} observations as well as populations of lensed SMGs&#10;from wide-field observations using Planck and in the mm band from South&#10;Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope .&#10;&#10;In this work we study the physical properties of a [HERSCHEL]{}&#10;identified sub-millimeter galaxy at that is lensed by a foreground&#10;massive cluster at . The signal boost provided by the gravitational&#10;lensing in combination with our high resolution deep imaging and&#10;spectroscopy in the near and far infrared gives us a unique opportunity&#10;to study the star formation activity and physical properties of this&#10;lensed system as a very massive SMG candidate identified during peak&#10;epoch of star-formation activity .&#10;&#10;This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our&#10;photometric and spectroscopic observations of NA.v1.489. In Section 3 we&#10;discuss our lens modeling of the system using high resolution&#10;photometric and spectroscopic data of the foreground cluster system. We&#10;study the physical properties of the lensed system in Section 4. The&#10;results of the combined lens modeling, SED fitting and spectral line&#10;analysis are discussed in Section 5 and in Section 6 we summarize our&#10;main findings. Throughout this paper we assume a standard cosmology with&#10;, and . All magnitudes are in the AB system where .">

Two observing runs were carried out on April 27 and June 9&#10;2013 under excellent 3mm weather conditions in the C and D array&#10;configurations, respectively. The 3mm receivers were used to cover the&#10;redshifted line, employing a correlator setup providing a bandwidth of&#10;3.75GHz in each sideband and spectral resolution of 5.208MHz (17kms).&#10;The line was placed in the upper sidebands for both tracks with the&#10;local oscillator tuned to 90.7GHz; this resulted in 1.9 hours and 2.6&#10;hours of 15 antenna-equivalent on-source time after discarding unusable&#10;visibility data for C and D array observations, respectively.&#10;&#10;For both tracks, the nearby radio quasar J1310+323 was observed every 15&#10;minutes for pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, and MWC349 was&#10;observed as the primary absolute flux calibrator. J1337129 and 3C273&#10;were observed as bandpass calibrators for C and D array observations,&#10;respectively, yielding 15% calibration accuracy.

The extended arcs associated with lensing (of a galaxy at an&#10;unknown redshift) are visible in the high resolution HST image of the&#10;cluster (blue arcs in Figure \[fig:Fig1\]). The SMG (marked in&#10;Figure \[fig:Fig1\] with the solid box) was independently identified&#10;from [HERSCHEL]{} 500m observations by as a potential lensed candidate.&#10;We performed lens modeling of this system using the publicly available&#10;code of [lenstool]{}[^1] . [lenstool]{} performs Bayesian optimization&#10;given the redshift and location of the identified images of the lensed&#10;sources in the image plane. We used the two blue extended arcs&#10;identified in the G1-G4 system (Figure \[fig:Fig1\]) along with the arc&#10;produced by G1 to constrain the lens model. We used [SExtractor]{} on&#10;the Gemini r-band to identify the peak positions of the arcs and counter&#10;images in the image plane as required by [lenstool]{}. We allowed the&#10;redshift of the arcs to vary during the optimization. In lens modeling&#10;analysis we used a combination of a cluster potential together with&#10;galaxy potentials as the foreground deflecting components. We use a NFW&#10;profile for the lensing cluster at consistent with the spectroscopic&#10;observations of various cluster members. For the galaxy-scale potentials&#10;we used the spectroscopic identifications from Gemini and our&#10;Keck/DEIMOS observations as the main foreground system combined with a&#10;red-sequence identified cluster members from the color-magnitude diagram&#10;from the Gemini+[ HST]{} extracted photometry. Figure \[fig:Fig4\] shows&#10;the foreground potentials used to construct the lensing system. We&#10;additionally keep the cluster potential ellipticity and position&#10;variable, with the allowed centroid offset of 10 arcsec around the&#10;initial value (at the center of the four galaxies).&#10;&#10;The output of the optimization process provides the best estimate&#10;positions and properties of the deflecting potentials and is considered&#10;the best-fit model. Figure \[fig:Fig4\] shows the best-fit model&#10;computed by [lenstool]{} along with the generated amplification map. We&#10;use this map to measure the magnification of the SMG at the SMA peak&#10;position. Averaging the amplification map across the corresponding&#10;images identified from the [SExtractor]{} segmentation maps yield&#10;magnifications of and for the stellar and dust components respectively&#10;from modes of the computed Bayesian model. We note here that the&#10;magnification for both emissions (stellar and dust) are computed from&#10;the same amplification map (constructed from the Gemini r-band) for the&#10;lensing cluster due to lack of multiple images associated with dust that&#10;would allow a separate lens modeling. In the next Section we de-magnify&#10;the stellar and dust continuum fluxes by the above-measured values&#10;before measuring the physical properties through SED fitting.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:Fig5\] shows the Gemini r-band image used in lens modeling&#10;along with the re-constructed lens model in the image plane and the&#10;residual map. The reconstructed image is generated by tracing the source&#10;plane image through the best-fit lens model.

Figure \[fig:Fig6\] shows the Keck and SMA&#10;images of the lensed SMG NA.v1.489, along with the source plane&#10;reconstructed three color image using the lens model computed for the&#10;cluster as discussed above. The reconstructed source plane has red&#10;colors as expected from the observed SED and consistent with other&#10;rest-frame optical studies of SMGs. The rest-frame optical emission, as&#10;arising from stellar light, has a co-moving distance kpc from SMA dust&#10;emission in the source plane. The stellar and dust emissions have&#10;half-light radii of 0.63kpc and 1.86kpc respectively measured from a&#10;Sérsic profile using [galfit]{} . This shows a more extended dust&#10;emission that is also offset from the stellar light as reported&#10;previously in the literature for high- SMGs and would suggest the&#10;presence of differential magnification (yet not significant) as reported&#10;above for the stellar and dust components.&#10;&#10;[^1]: &lt;http://projets.lam.fr/projects/lenstool/wiki&gt;">

  <outline text="SED inferred parameters" _note="We fit the SED of the background SMG with a library of model templates&#10;using the publicly available SED fitting code of [magphys]{} .&#10;[magphys]{} uses the synthesis models for the stellar light and the&#10;attenuation by to compute the total infrared luminosity absorbed and&#10;reradiated by dust using different dust components at different&#10;wavelengths based on an energy balance scheme . We used an updated&#10;version of the [magphys]{} code that is better-suited for sub-millimeter&#10;galaxies . Briefly, it does so by extending the SED parameter priors to&#10;the high redshift, high optical depth and actively star forming regime&#10;that is typical of star forming galaxies at high redshift by adding new&#10;star formation histories and dust attenuation recipes .&#10;&#10;We use the photometry of NA.v1.489 outlined in Table 1 and correct it&#10;for the magnification (reported in the previous section) as an input for&#10;SED fitting in [magphys]{}. This includes near-infrared data from [&#10;HST]{}/WFC3 F110W, Keck and , infrared measurements by [SPITZER]{}/IRAC&#10;in 3.6m and 4.5m, WISE observations at 12.0m and 22.0m, far-infrared&#10;photometry from [HERSCHEL]{}/SPIRE in the 250m, 350m and 500m bands and&#10;1.31mm observations by SMA. For the SED fitting we fixed the redshift of&#10;the galaxy to its spectroscopic redshift () measured from CO&#10;observations. The best-fit SED and photometry are presented in&#10;Figure \[fig:Fig7\] with the best-fit measured physical parameters&#10;reported in Table 2. For star-formation rate, we used a Kennicutt&#10;relation with Chabrier initial mass function to convert the total&#10;infrared luminosities to SFR (; ). The SED of NA.v1.489 is consistent&#10;with the presence of a Balmer break at and would allow for robust&#10;stellar mass estimates.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the SED inferred parameters are for stellar&#10;light heating the dust and does not include AGN contribution. NA.v1.489&#10;shows excess radio flux with respect to the infrared luminosity compared&#10;to the average values expected for high- SMGs which could hint towards&#10;the presence of an AGN. Although there are studies such as , which show&#10;a low fraction of AGN presence within SMG populations, there are studies&#10;that point to the existence of an AGN component within SMGs .&#10;&#10;The lack of an AGN recipe in our SED fitting with [magphys]{} should not&#10;strongly affect the estimated physical parameters . In a recent study,&#10;in fact, using synthetic models of galaxies with [H]{}-ATLAS like&#10;photometry computed from simulations showed that [magphys]{} estimated&#10;physical properties are robust even in the extreme case of AGN&#10;contributing as much as 25% to UV to IR luminosity.&#10;&#10;Physical properties measured from SED fits have inherent uncertainties&#10;associated with choices of the input parameters in building the&#10;templates such as the assumed star-formation history and dust&#10;attenuation . To further examine the robustness of our estimated&#10;physical properties, and in particular the stellar mass, we applied the&#10;SED fitting method detailed in which is based on 35000 templates from&#10;the library of plus some templates of and , all of which were developed&#10;using [grasil]{}[^1] . They are based on numerical calculations of&#10;radiative transfer within a galaxy, which is assumed to be a triaxial&#10;axisymmetric system with diffuse dust and dense molecular clouds, in&#10;which stars are born. The templates cover a broad range of galaxy&#10;properties from quiescent to starburst and span an range from to mag.&#10;The extinction curve (Figure 3 of ) is derived from the modified dust&#10;grain size distribution of . The star formation histories are assumed to&#10;be a smooth Schmidt-type law i.e., the SFR is proportional to the gas&#10;mass to some power; see with a starburst (if any) on top of that,&#10;starting 50Myr before the time at which the SED is computed. There are&#10;seven free parameters in the library of : the normalization of the&#10;Schmidt-type law, the timescale of the mass in-fall, the intensity of&#10;the starburst, the timescale for molecular cloud destruction, the&#10;optical depth of the molecular clouds, the age of the galaxy and the&#10;inclination of the disk with respect to the observer. found that the&#10;choice of star formation history (SFH) assumed in the SED modeling can&#10;lead to a systematic shift of stellar mass. However, this shift is at&#10;most a factor of for a single-burst SFH (i.e. all stars formed at the&#10;same epoch), unrealistic for such massive and actively star-forming&#10;galaxy. Moreover, double-component SFH (utilized here) were found to&#10;result in the most accurate stellar masses of real and simulated SMGs .&#10;We re-fit our observed SED with the new set of templates using&#10;[grasil]{} as discussed above. Figure \[fig:Fig7\] shows the [grasil]{}&#10;best-fit template compared to the [magphys]{}.

<outline text="Discussion" _note="NA.v1.489 has a molecular gas line ratio of as measured from GBT and&#10;CARMA. This is higher than the measured ratio for normal star-forming&#10;galaxies , with . The larger value is associated with the increased&#10;star-formation activity which could raise the higher- CO line fluxes at&#10;higher energies . The measured molecular gas line flux ratio of&#10;NA.v1.489 further agrees with the mean value reported by for SMGs () at&#10;. Figure \[fig:Fig8\] shows the CO molecular line flux ratios as a&#10;function of infrared luminosity for NA.v1.489 compared to other SMGs and&#10;QSO host galaxies at , normal star-forming galaxies and local ULIRGs .&#10;Although the excitation temperature of is not very high and could well&#10;be produced by a compact starburst , a particularly energetic source,&#10;such as an AGN, could further increase the line ratios. NA.v1.489 has&#10;measured line ratios consistent with the line excitation produced by a&#10;starburst rather than a QSO host galaxy (which has ; ). However, given&#10;the uncertainties in both measurements, line excitation due to the&#10;presence of an AGN cannot be ruled out.&#10;&#10;NA.v1.489 has an SED inferred infrared luminosity that puts it among the&#10;most IR-luminous extra-galactic sources and which then yields an SED&#10;inferred SFR comparable to the most intense star forming systems at .&#10;Figure \[fig:Fig9\] shows the SFR versus stellar mass plot along with&#10;the main sequence of star forming galaxies derived from . The main&#10;sequence relation sits above the corresponding local relation such that&#10;at any given fixed stellar mass the high- counter part would be much&#10;more star forming compared to the local SFGs. The scatter along this&#10;relation, marked as the green shaded area, is associated to the&#10;intrinsic properties of galaxies such as the change in star formation&#10;histories and metallicities . As we see from Figure \[fig:Fig9\],&#10;NA.v1.489 sits at the main sequence relation plotted for from . This is&#10;supported by recent studies of high redshift SMGs pointing towards small&#10;deviations from the SFG main sequence . The intense SFR agrees with the&#10;MS position given the large stellar mass of the system and the huge&#10;reservoirs of molecular gas available. The large stellar mass is in&#10;agreement with simulations of SMGs and SMG models of requiring large&#10;stellar masses for bright flux densities in the sub-mm (with needed to&#10;create a 850m flux density of 3mJy) also seen in observed stellar mass&#10;estimates of SMGs at from multi-wavelength SED measurements . The&#10;intense SFR could be explained as being due the higher molecular gas&#10;mass available within these systems that provide the material needed for&#10;the excess star formation . The dust temperature of SMGs derived from&#10;far-IR observations is indicative of the ISM in these systems. The local&#10;infra-red luminous sub-millimeter galaxies show a clear trend between&#10;the dust temperature () and the infrared luminosity with similar trends&#10;observed for high redshift far-infrared or sub-millimeter selected&#10;samples of galaxies . At high-redshift, these relations are biased&#10;towards colder temperatures for sub-mm selected samples at low as direct&#10;observations in the far-infrared are mostly limited to bright sources at&#10;with studies of far-infrared lensed systems extending this to lower .&#10;The relation shows modest evolution with redshift from&#10;[HERSCHEL]{}-selected samples out to where SMGs at high- are found to be&#10;on average colder than the local counterparts . Figure \[fig:Fig9\]&#10;shows that NA.v1.489 has dust temperature () and far-IR luminosity ()&#10;that agrees with the general trend observed for the SMGs . The scatter&#10;in this relation is associated with selection biases as well as the&#10;presence of colder dust temperatures in high- SMGs (compared to the&#10;local counterparts) . Figure \[fig:Fig9\] further shows that NA.v1.489&#10;on average has a colder dust temperature compared to sub-mm and&#10;[HERSCHEL]{}-selected samples of SMGs at at similar infrared&#10;luminosities . The lower dust temperature measured for NA.v1.489&#10;disfavors a major merger scenario. Furthermore the colder is consistent&#10;with a more extended dust distribution as observed from our SMA&#10;observations.&#10;&#10;The large molecular gas measured from CO observations is responsible for&#10;the intense star-formation observed in NA.v1.489. Similar reservoirs of&#10;cold molecular gas are observed in other extreme starbursts at high&#10;redshift . NA.v1.489 has a gas depletion time-scale of () 43Myr, much&#10;shorter than the star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and&#10;comparable to gas depletion time-scales in other sub-mm selected dusty&#10;galaxies at high redshift . The short time-scale and intense&#10;star-formation rates are responsible for the mass build-up in NA.v1.489.&#10;Figure \[fig:Fig10\] shows the gas depletion time-scale of NA.v1.489&#10;compared to normal star-forming and sub-millimeter galaxies at similar&#10;and lower redshifts. The star-formation rate efficiency of NA.v1.489 ()&#10;is much higher than normal star forming galaxies. The intense&#10;star-formation in NA.v1.489 is not only because of the huge molecular&#10;gas reservoirs, which is comparable in some cases to those of massive&#10;star-forming galaxies , but also to higher SFE that is also observed in&#10;other high- SMGs . Figure \[fig:Fig10\] shows the SFE of NA.v1.489 as a&#10;function of infrared luminosity (; rest-frame ) compared to the normal&#10;star-forming and sub-millimeter galaxies. NA.v1.489 in particular has a&#10;higher SFE compared to normal star-forming galaxies and local ULIRGs&#10;which is also observed in other SMGs at similar redshift . NA.v1.489, in&#10;particular, has a low gas fraction (with ) compared to less massive&#10;normal star-forming and sub-millimeter galaxies (Figure \[fig:Fig10\]).&#10;Given the high stellar mass and low gas fraction, NA.v1.489 is a SMG&#10;that likely has already formed most of the stars.&#10;&#10;The molecular gas mass as measured by the CO line luminosity depends on&#10;the assumed value for the conversion factor (). One of the main&#10;uncertainties in determining the total gas mass in fact lies with the&#10;uncertainties associated with the conversion factor . In this work, we&#10;assumed a conversion factor of to estimate the total molecular gas mass&#10;from CO observations. This is lower than the assumed value for the Milky&#10;Way ( measured from direct observations of molecular Hydrogen and CO; )&#10;and that of nearby and high redshift normal star-forming galaxies . The&#10;lower conversion factor is more favored for the extreme starburst due to&#10;higher gas temperature and velocity dispersions with the higher values&#10;overestimating the molecular gas mass in these systems . This is&#10;supported by the dust temperature measured for NA.v1.489 which could be&#10;a proxy for gas temperature . For normal star-forming galaxies analogs&#10;of NA.v1.489 (i.e. at similar stellar mass and redshift) could be&#10;measured given the metallicity dependent relation provided by (see&#10;Equations in that paper; see also ), where metallicity is estimated at&#10;the redshift and stellar mass of NA.v1.489 following the&#10;mass-metallicity relation (; see Equation 12 in ). This yields a higher&#10;compared to what is assumed for starbursts overestimating the molecular&#10;gas. Given the uncertainties one could derive a possible range of&#10;molecular gas masses following for a range of possible conversion&#10;factors. Here we report the gas mass estimate based on which is&#10;consistent with what was discussed above.&#10;&#10;We investigate the far infrared and radio properties of NA.v1.489 by&#10;looking at the FIR/radio ratio () and how it compares with the SMGs at&#10;similar and lower redshifts. We measured a for NA.v1.489 which is&#10;consistent with the average value derived for samples of far-infrared&#10;selected galaxies at lower redshifts the existence of which reflects the&#10;correlation between the processes that produce the underlying emissions;&#10;namely star formation activity and synchrotron radiation from supernova&#10;processes contributing to FIR and radio emission respectively . The&#10;measured is consistent with low redshift and high redshift estimates as&#10;well as the average value for SMGs . In fact showed that the ratio is&#10;not evolving with time. The measured radio luminosity of NA.v1.489 ()&#10;and FIR/radio ratio indicate that NA.v1.489 is not dominated by a&#10;radio-loud AGN (with ) or having a radio excess (with ) as defined by .&#10;The radio luminosity () as measured by the JVLA, yields a using the&#10;calibration in . This agrees with the SFR measured previously from the&#10;infrared luminosity derived from multi-band SED fit with the difference&#10;associated with the uncertainties that exist in the calibrations.">

<outline text="Summary and Conclusion" _note="We have presented a detailed study of a massive [ HERSCHEL]{}/SPIRE&#10;detected sub-millimeter galaxy at , gravitationally lensed by a&#10;[SPITZER]{} and WISE detected cluster at . We provide detailed lens&#10;modeling of the system through combined Keck and Gemini spectroscopic&#10;and imaging observations used to identify foreground cluster members and&#10;lensing multiple images. Our best lens model provide a lensing&#10;magnification of and for the stellar and dust emissions respectively for&#10;NA.v1.489. Multi-band SED fitting, corrected for the lensing&#10;magnification, provides physical properties of NA.v1.489 including&#10;stellar mass (), total infrared luminosity (; rest-frame m), dust mass&#10;() and dust temperature (); see Table 2. We further derived total&#10;molecular gas and explored ionization state of the gas from&#10;spectroscopic observations of the CO molecular emission lines. The&#10;combined physical properties derived from the SED fits and spectroscopic&#10;molecular CO line observations reveal that NA.v1.489 is a very massive&#10;sub-millimeter galaxy with , putting it as one of the most extreme&#10;starbursts during peak epoch of star-formation, without a dominant AGN&#10;mode. The low- molecular line luminosities revealed the existence of&#10;large reservoir of molecular gas that is being rapidly converted into&#10;stars at a much higher pace compared to that of local ULIRGs (see Figure&#10;\[fig:Fig10\]). This combined with the measured low gas fraction () and&#10;high stellar mass, shows that NA.v1.489 has already assembled most of&#10;its mass and is most likely on its way to becoming quiescent, forming a&#10;progenitor for the most massive early type galaxies found in the local&#10;Universe.&#10;&#10;Observations of this galaxy seem to suggest that the location of SMGs on&#10;a diagram is consistent with the main sequence of star-formation at the&#10;very massive end (Figure \[fig:Fig9\]; ) while still being above the&#10;relation which is supported by excessive star-formation rate driving the&#10;intense infrared luminosities. This is in contrast to less massive SMGs&#10;with much higher observed SFRs compared to normal star-forming galaxies&#10;at similar stellar masses at (Figure \[fig:Fig9\]; ). As discussed&#10;above, this indicate that the very massive SMGs are on their way to&#10;becoming quiescent systems. We note here that in addition to&#10;uncertainties associated with stellar mass (which we addressed in&#10;Section 4), uncertainties in the magnifications measured from the lens&#10;model could also lead to a high stellar mass. To test the robustness of&#10;the derived magnifications in the lens model, we recomputed the&#10;magnification using MCMC maximum likelihood which yielded the original&#10;magnification factor.&#10;&#10;One of the main contributing factors to the transition of galaxies from&#10;a star-forming phase to that of quiescence is the feedback associated&#10;with AGN activity diluting and heating up the molecular gas ceasing&#10;star-formation . This generally begins with the central black hole&#10;gaining mass through constant accretion after which the AGN is ignited .&#10;The AGN signature has been observed in SEDs of SMGs in the mid-infrared&#10;and X-ray . The far-infrared luminosities are however believed to be&#10;mainly driven by star-formation activity rather than AGN . High emission&#10;line excitation ratios could be evidence for the presence of an AGN,&#10;though a lack of such highly excited lines does not necessarily rule out&#10;the existence of it. A combined X-ray through radio observations of&#10;distant SMGs along with mid-infrared constrained SEDs and emission line&#10;ratios is needed to study the presence and role of the AGNs in detail.&#10;As discussed above, although we did not see a signature of a dominant&#10;AGN mode from CO line ratios in NA.v1.489, the presence of such&#10;component could not be ruled out with current observations.">
