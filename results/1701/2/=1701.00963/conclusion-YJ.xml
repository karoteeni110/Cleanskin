<outline text="Conclusion" _note="This paper presents RADIUS, a system for detecting anomalous link&#10;quality degradations in low-power radio links. The RADIUS system is&#10;light-weight, accurate and robust to a diversity of link conditions and&#10;dynamic environment changes. To achieve this, RADIUS (1) lays its&#10;foundation on a Bayesian thresholding scheme, integrated with dedicated&#10;techniques for (2) minimal training set size estimation, (3)&#10;sliding-window data smoothing, (4) distribution self-adaptation, and (5)&#10;feedback-based threshold parameter adaptation. The comparison with two&#10;popular statistical approaches shows that RADIUS does not need&#10;fine-tuning of its threshold parameter to achieve near-optimal accuracy&#10;across the network. The impact of the system parameters is also&#10;investigated in detail, identifying the best configuration for an indoor&#10;environment. Moreover, we have implemented the RADIUS system and&#10;evaluated its performance on an indoor WSN testbed, showing that it can&#10;adapt to dynamic environment changes and achieve accurate detection over&#10;the entire network with an average error rate of 6.13%.">
