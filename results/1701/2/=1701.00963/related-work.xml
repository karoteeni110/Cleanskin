<outline text="Related Work" _note="Anomalous link quality degradation is a major cause of high packet&#10;losses in WSNs, reported by previous deployments . Among various link&#10;quality metrics , RSSI provides direct channel quality information at&#10;the receiver, which is typically a required input for remedy systems in&#10;order to tune stack parameters such as transmission power or other layer&#10;parameters . Many studies analyzed the relation between RSSI and packet&#10;loss and studied the temporal properties of RSSI . Only very few works&#10;have investigated how to use RSSI readings to detect good links (with&#10;low packet losses) turning into weak links (with high packet losses)&#10;with OPTIMAL performance, i.e., ROBUST DETECTION WITH MINIMAL DETECTION&#10;ERROR. Our work is related to previous research on two topics: (1)&#10;network monitoring approaches for detecting link-related failures, and&#10;(2) anomaly detection techniques developed for WSNs.&#10;&#10;Existing approaches of network monitoring and diagnosis generally rely&#10;on active collection of node and network status. Some of them are&#10;centralized approaches, e.g., Sympathy and Emstar , in which a large&#10;amount of status information from individual sensor nodes (e.g., packet&#10;counter) is delivered to the sink to determine the failure causes.&#10;Agnostic Diagnosis constructs correlation graphs at the back-end server&#10;from collected system metrics to detect link failures. Other approaches,&#10;e.g., self-diagnosis , avoid sending all information to the sink by&#10;encouraging multiple sensor nodes to exchange information for&#10;cooperative failure detection. All these systems are powerful at&#10;detecting various failure types. However, they introduce large&#10;communication overhead to energy-constrained WSNs. Besides, MOST OF&#10;THESE SYSTEMS USE METRICS LIKE PACKET COUNTER OR RETRANSMISSION COUNTER.&#10;Though such metrics enable easy detection of packet losses, they can&#10;hardly be used to determine the cause, e.g., whether a loss is due to&#10;bad channel condition or packet collision. Instead, RADIUS utilizes&#10;RSSI, a channel quality attribute resident within every received packet,&#10;which does not require active information collection, allowing fully&#10;distributed anomaly detection.&#10;&#10;The research on anomaly detection in wired and wireless ad hoc networks&#10;is quite mature, but only a few solutions can be directly applied to&#10;WSNs due to the limited memory and computational capability of sensor&#10;nodes. Data mining and computational intelligence-based techniques, such&#10;as clustering , support vector machine and neural networks , own strong&#10;detection generality and accuracy as long as adequate attributes are in&#10;use . However, they all come with high complexity. In addition, they&#10;often rely on a central entity to cope with heavy tasks. PAD deduces&#10;link level errors with a probabilistic inference model maintained at a&#10;server. Statistical techniques such as kernel density estimator also&#10;require high computational capability to generate the density estimator.&#10;A recent work of employing such techniques is RASID , implementing the&#10;system on more powerful devices (WiFi access points) to detect&#10;intruders. Due to the limited resources of sensor nodes, data mining or&#10;machine learning oriented approaches are normally infeasible for&#10;distributed anomaly detection systems in WSNs.&#10;&#10;The most widely used anomaly detection technique in WSNs is the&#10;statistical measure-based technique (e.g. mean, variance, maximum,&#10;self-defined) due to its low complexity and high effectiveness of&#10;finding detection boundaries (i.e. thresholds). For example,&#10;Fine-grained Analysis detects security attacks when RSSI changes exceed&#10;the measured maximum fluctuation occurred during the initial training&#10;phase. In the statistical measure category, there are two often used&#10;techniques: (1) CDF-BASED thresholding (or percentile-based&#10;thresholding), and (2) CHEBYSHEV INEQUALITY-based thresholding. In&#10;CDF-based schemes, the threshold is defined as the X-TH PERCENTILE of&#10;the underlying data distribution of the monitored attribute. An example&#10;is the Memento system where an empirical CDF of consecutively missing&#10;heartbeat numbers is used to detect sensor failures. Another example is&#10;RASID which also defines a threshold at a given percentile after the&#10;density function is estimated. In other cases, when the underlying&#10;probability distribution of the monitored attribute is not known A&#10;PRIORI, the Chebyshev thresholding technique has often been applied. For&#10;instance, Chebyshev thresholding is used in to troubleshoot the network&#10;performance issues. In , a fusion threshold bound is derived using the&#10;Chebyshev inequality for target detection in WSNs. Despite their low&#10;complexity and easy adaptation to WSNs, both CDF-based and Chebyshev&#10;inequality-based methods are not designed for optimizing detection&#10;accuracy. In addition, achieving robust performance in detection&#10;accuracy by them is also a challenge. Later in this paper, we show that&#10;employing these two methods to achieve best detection accuracy&#10;implicitly requires manual fine-tuning of the threshold parameters for&#10;each monitored link, which is difficult to do in practice. In RADIUS, we&#10;employ the Bayes decision theory to minimize the detection error, which&#10;is also a thresholding technique and has been widely used in other&#10;fields, e.g., signal detection and image analysis. Specifically, we&#10;apply the Bayesian thresholding technique to identify good links and&#10;weak links based on the monitored RSSI values. Its complexity is similar&#10;to that of the CDF or Chebyshev thresholding technique. Additionally, we&#10;combine the Bayesian thresholding technique with several supporting&#10;techniques to build a robust and accurate system for detecting anomalous&#10;link quality degradation in WSNs.">
