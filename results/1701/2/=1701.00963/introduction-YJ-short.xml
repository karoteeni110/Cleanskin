<outline text="Introduction" _note="The performance of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) often deteriorates&#10;after in-situ deployment of the network . Link quality degradation, due&#10;to, e.g., fading and interference, is one of the major reported causes&#10;behind such behavior, which may be significant enough to impact the&#10;link’s performance, e.g., the packet delivery ratio. Detecting such&#10;anomalous degradation in link quality is crucial for an operational WSN&#10;to decide possible remedy actions such as tuning stack parameters . In&#10;such way, the network can continuously maintain its performance and&#10;satisfy the user’s requirements.&#10;&#10;In resource constrained WSNs, detecting anomalous link quality&#10;degradation requires [**lightweight**]{} solutions with low overheads in&#10;using memory, computation and communication resources. Resource-hungry&#10;centralized monitoring systems and/or machine learning-based detection&#10;techniques are hence hardly applicable to WSNs, due to large&#10;communication and/or computation overheads. In addition, a solution&#10;should be [**accurate**]{} with a low error rate (false&#10;positive/negative rate) and be [**robust**]{} with consistent&#10;performance under diverse link conditions and dynamic environment&#10;changes. However, in WSNs, due to the stochastic nature of link quality&#10;metrics, e.g., received signal strength indicator (RSSI) , it is&#10;challenging to distinguish between true link quality degradation and&#10;normal randomness. Data smoothing may only mitigate the problem.&#10;CDF-based and Chebyshev inequality-based statistical techniques are&#10;lightweight and seem to be effective in making the distinguishing.&#10;However, our investigation, as to be shown later in this paper, reveals&#10;that it is difficult to optimize them to achieve both high detection&#10;accuracy and robustness for links which may experience diverse link&#10;conditions and dynamic environment changes.&#10;&#10;To meet these requirements, i.e., lightweight, accurate and robust, we&#10;have designed a system for detecting anomalous link quality degradation,&#10;called RADIUS. In addition to being lightweight, its design has also&#10;been aimed at minimizing the detection error (caused by normal&#10;randomness of RSSI) in discriminating good links from weak links and at&#10;being robust in maintaining the detection performance for different&#10;links and under dynamic environment changes. Central to the design is a&#10;threshold-based decision approach (for being lightweight) that has its&#10;foundation on the Bayes decision theory (for being accurate and robust).&#10;&#10;To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has investigated the&#10;applicability of Bayesian thresholding in detecting anomalous link&#10;quality degradation in WSNs. A possible reason is perhaps due to the&#10;various challenges inherent in applying the approach. To address these&#10;challenges, various techniques have been developed to identify the&#10;number of RSSI samples needed to achieve a “good” approximation of the&#10;mean and the standard deviation, to update the mean and standard&#10;deviation estimates, and to choose and update a “proper” setting for the&#10;A PRIORI probability, where the mean, the standard deviation and the A&#10;PRIORI probability are the three fundamental variables used in the Bayes&#10;formula.&#10;&#10;A prototype of the RADIUS system has been implemented and deployed in an&#10;indoor testbed. For proper configuration of the parameters involved in&#10;the various techniques in RADIUS, suggestions on their settings are&#10;given based on extensive experiments. In addition, we found that high&#10;detection accuracy can be achieved by RADIUS under diverse link&#10;conditions more robustly as compared to the CDF and Chebyshev&#10;thresholding techniques. Moreover, the overhead analysis and the&#10;detection results show that RADIUS not only has low overheads in memory,&#10;communication and computation, but also is accurate in detecting link&#10;quality anomalies for all links across the network, maintaining a stable&#10;error rate of 6.13% on average. These are an indication of RADIUS in&#10;fulfilling the requirements.&#10;&#10;The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \[sec:related\]&#10;discusses the related work. Section \[sec:system\] presents the system&#10;design and motivates the adoption of Bayesian thresholding. Section&#10;\[sec:approach\] introduces the key techniques used in RADIUS. Section&#10;\[sec:parameterChoice\] analyzes the effect of the various involved&#10;parameters in these RADIUS techniques on the detection performance.&#10;Section \[sec:imp&amp;eva\] reports the details of our implementation, the&#10;corresponding system overheads and the overall performance evaluation in&#10;an operational system on an indoor testbed. Finally, Section&#10;\[sec:conclusion\] concludes the paper.">
