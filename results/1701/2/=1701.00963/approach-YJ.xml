<outline text="The RADIUS Techniques" _note="RADIUS aims to achieve robust and accurate detection for maintaining the&#10;network performance by combining the Bayesian thresholding with several&#10;supporting techniques. In this section, we present the Bayesian&#10;thresholding technique, elaborate the supporting techniques and identify&#10;the involved parameters.">
  <outline text="Bayesian Thresholding" _note="A classical example that employs Bayesian thresholding is the binary&#10;detection problem, as known in the communication literature . The goal&#10;is to detect binary digits “0” and “1” in a noisy channel based on the&#10;received signal level with the knowledge of the A PRIORI probabilities&#10;of “0” and “1”. Mapping such a problem to our problem of detecting link&#10;quality degradation, our goal is to detect a link either being a good&#10;link (with low packet losses) or a weak link (with high packet losses)&#10;with a minimized error rate based on the RSSI values measured at the&#10;receiver of the link.">
    <outline text="Mathematic Basis." _note="Let and respectively denote a link being a good and a weak link. Let&#10;denote a detection error (either a false positive or a false negative).&#10;Then, based on the Bayes decision theory, , the probability of detection&#10;error, can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities as&#10;follows: where is the A PRIORI probability of a link being a good link,&#10;and . is the probability of false positives, i.e., misidentifying a good&#10;link as a weak link, while is the probability of false negatives, i.e.,&#10;failing to detect a degradation in link quality.&#10;&#10;We assume that the RSSI follows a normal distribution , which has been&#10;experimentally validated for low power communication in WSNs . For&#10;simplicity, we further assume that the distributions of RSSI for a weak&#10;link and for a good link, while with different means and respectively,&#10;have the same standard deviation . In other words, the probability&#10;density functions of RSSI for the good link and for the weak link are as&#10;follows: An example of these density functions is plotted in Figure&#10;\[fig:rssi-threshold\], where the false positive rate and the false&#10;negative rate are marked as shaded areas with respect to an RSSI&#10;threshold .&#10;&#10;Based on Equations \[equ:pdfWeak\] and \[equ:pdfGood\], the Bayes error&#10;can be expressed as a function of the threshold :&#10;&#10;We minimize by letting . We can then obtain the optimal threshold that&#10;minimizes the detection error and the resultant Bayes error as follows:&#10;where is a Q-function and is defined as:">

    <outline text="Application to RADIUS." _note="Applying the Bayesian thresholding technique to RADIUS essentially&#10;requires to find the Bayes threshold , as computed in Equation&#10;\[equ:rssiTHD\]. The use of Equation \[equ:rssiTHD\] also indicates that&#10;the computation of the Bayes threshold only depends on a few statistical&#10;measures, significantly reducing the complexity in comparison to typical&#10;Bayesian decision problems. These statistical measures include the mean&#10;of the density distribution of RSSI for a good link and for a weak link&#10;( and , respectively), as well as the standard deviation of the&#10;distribution.&#10;&#10;In the RADIUS system, the VCC monitors the end-to-end packet delivery&#10;ratio (PDR) of the network after the network is deployed. When the PDR&#10;satisfies the minimal user requirements, implying that all links being&#10;used are good links, the VCC informs all DAs to start the training&#10;phase. During this phase, the statistical measures and are computed from&#10;the collected RSSI samples for each individual link relevant to the&#10;higher-layer routing protocols. For the value of , we choose the border&#10;RSSI value of the “grey zone” (i.e., dBm) reported in previous&#10;experimental studies , which show that PDR decreases significantly when&#10;a link enters the “grey zone”.&#10;&#10;The A PRIORI probability required in Equation \[equ:rssiTHD\] is&#10;typically computed empirically based on previous experience or&#10;measurements. As this parameter has to be defined before the deployment,&#10;the setting of impacts on the detection performance of the operational&#10;system. In Section \[sec:motivationBayes\], we have presented its effect&#10;on the detection error in general. In Section \[sec:ThresholdChoice\],&#10;we will quantify the effect of on the FPR and the FNR in more details.">

    <outline text="Bayesian thresholding alone is not enough." _note="Despite that the Bayes threshold is designed in RADIUS to minimize&#10;detection error, it alone is not enough to build a robust and accurate&#10;system for the detection of anomalous link quality degradation in WSNs.&#10;There are several inherent challenges that have to be addressed in order&#10;to apply the thresholding technique. Some of them are introduced by the&#10;technique itself (e.g., accurate estimation of and ) while the others&#10;are caused by the fact that RSSI is highly influenced by environment&#10;changes (e.g., smoothing and threshold adaptation). In the rest of this&#10;section, we introduce these challenges and the techniques that we employ&#10;in RADIUS to address them.">

  <outline text="Estimating the Minimal Training Set Size" _note="According to Equation \[equ:rssiTHD\], finding the Bayes threshold&#10;requires to compute the mean and the standard deviation from a collected&#10;RSSI training set. The size of such a training set has a significant&#10;impact on the estimation error of and and hence a great impact on the&#10;system detection accuracy. Deciding the training set size involves&#10;considering a tradeoff between the detection accuracy and the training&#10;latency. A larger training set can provide a more accurate estimation of&#10;the underlying data distribution thus higher accuracy in estimating and&#10;, while it may significantly increase the training time. In addition,&#10;the training size should also differ from link to link for the specific&#10;statistical characteristics of individual links: small training set size&#10;may suffice for a stable link while a larger size is required for links&#10;with highly fluctuating RSSI readings.&#10;&#10;To address this challenge, we analyze the confidence interval to&#10;estimate the minimal training set size of RSSI values for each&#10;individual link. In this way, RADIUS achieves a good tradeoff between&#10;system detection accuracy and training latency. After the training phase&#10;starts, the minimal training set size is decided by the DAs for each&#10;individual link after the collection of a few RSSI samples.&#10;&#10;In particular, each DA first computes the standard deviation for the&#10;first samples of RSSI collected in a short time period. Then, the DA&#10;estimates the minimal training set size for a given error . According to&#10;the CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM, for an attribute with any type of underlying&#10;distribution, the margin error of the confidence interval for the&#10;attribute mean is , where is the z-score ( for a confidence level of&#10;99%), is the number of samples and is the population standard deviation.&#10;With this, the minimal training size is calculated as: where is a&#10;user-defined parameter for the maximum error of the estimated RSSI mean.&#10;In addition, can be substituted by the standard deviation of the first&#10;samples, which has to be larger than 30 .&#10;&#10;Applying Equation \[equ:minSampleSize\] allows every DA to find&#10;appropriate RSSI training set sizes for each of its observed links,&#10;achieving a good tradeoff between estimation accuracy and training&#10;latency before computing the Bayes thresholds. Nevertheless, we need to&#10;find appropriate settings of and to apply Equation&#10;\[equ:minSampleSize\]. In Section \[sec:evaParamTrainingSize\], we will&#10;show the impact of and on the training set size and subsequently on the&#10;overall detection accuracy of RADIUS and then suggest the parameter&#10;choices of and for an indoor environment.">

  <outline text="Data Smoothing" _note="As illustrated by Figure \[fig:PIMRC-RSSI\], the RSSI signal is random&#10;in nature. In other words, an RSSI value lower than the Bayes threshold&#10;may actually be attributed to its normal randomness while not due to&#10;anomalous channel quality degradation. As a consequence, comparing each&#10;individual RSSI value with the Bayes threshold and using the comparison&#10;result to decide about an anomaly can lead to an over or under&#10;estimation of anomalies.&#10;&#10;To overcome this limitation and make RADIUS more robust, each DA applies&#10;a sliding window of size to compute a short-term average of RSSI and&#10;compares the -averaged RSSI with the Bayes threshold to trigger an&#10;anomaly detection. Intuitively, the choice of has an influence on the&#10;detection accuracy. A smaller makes the detection more responsive, but&#10;it may not be sufficient to clean the noise. On the other hand, a larger&#10;may be a better choice for data cleaning, but overly smoothing may fail&#10;to capture abnormal events. To understand the impact of the sliding&#10;window size, we show the effect of on the system performance and suggest&#10;a proper setting for indoor environments in Section&#10;\[sec:ImpactDataSmoothing\].">

  <outline text="Updating the Training Set" _note="After the Bayes threshold is determined, RADIUS performs anomaly&#10;detection on the monitored RSSI values by comparing them against . While&#10;is designed to minimize the detection error, the underlying RSSI&#10;distribution may vary due to environmental changes. Consequently, the&#10;mean and standard deviation estimated in the training phase may no&#10;longer be valid. This requires updating the estimated RSSI distribution,&#10;as well as accordingly, in response to environmental changes. To cope&#10;with dynamic changes in the environment, we update the mean and standard&#10;deviation of the RSSI distribution during the entire anomaly detection&#10;phase. The Bayes threshold is then updated using Equation&#10;\[equ:rssiTHD\]. Specifically, we update the mean and standard deviation&#10;by updating the training set with the normal RSSI readings observed&#10;during the period of detection. To identify whether an RSSI value is&#10;normal or not, RADIUS assigns an anomaly score for it at time ,&#10;indicating the significance of the anomalous behavior. is calculated by&#10;, where is the sliding window average of RSSI values and is the Bayes&#10;threshold.&#10;&#10;During the detection phase, RADIUS collects consecutive RSSI readings in&#10;disjoint groups of size and also their anomaly scores in a separate&#10;group to compute the average anomaly score. The group of RSSI readings&#10;with an average anomaly score of less than one is added to the training&#10;set. Through this, the training set is updated. This technique is&#10;similar to the silence profile updating scheme in for intrusion&#10;detection. RADIUS, however, needs to keep separate groups to store&#10;anomaly scores because the threshold may vary in the middle of an update&#10;process due to the A PRIORI probability refinement technique discussed&#10;in Section \[sec:prioriRefinement\], while it remains constant in the&#10;scheme used in .&#10;&#10;To minimize the memory overhead due to the update process, we employ a&#10;memory-efficient way to update the RSSI mean and standard deviation&#10;without incrementing the buffer to store new RSSI samples. Details of&#10;its implementation and memory overhead are described in Section&#10;\[sec:overhead\]. In addition, updating the training set requires a&#10;proper setting of the parameter . In Section&#10;\[sec:evaParamTrainingUpdate\], we quantify the effect of on the&#10;performance of RADIUS and recommend the appropriate value for an indoor&#10;environment.">

  <outline text="Refinement of the A Priori Probability" _note="In addition to the RSSI mean and standard deviation that are measured&#10;and updated as previously discussed, Equation \[equ:rssiTHD\] uses&#10;another parameter, . This parameter is an empirical, A PRIORI&#10;probability decided before system deployment. We showed earlier that the&#10;performance of RADIUS is not sensitive to the setting of . However, an&#10;initial coarse setting of , due to environment changes, may no longer&#10;provide the best detection accuracy and hence become outdated, requiring&#10;a refinement.&#10;&#10;To address this challenge, RADIUS refines the A PRIORI probability and&#10;then updates the Bayes threshold during the detection phase when&#10;necessary. Specifically, when an anomaly is detected and an alarm is&#10;triggered, the VCC keeps recording the number of false alarms. An alarm&#10;is considered as a false alarm if the PDR over the path of the anomalous&#10;link, when the alarm is received at the VCC, remains above a given&#10;threshold. RADIUS counts the number of consecutive false alarms. When&#10;the number exceeds a predefined value , the VCC informs the specific DA&#10;and the DA adjusts , incrementing it by until reaching a predefined&#10;MAXIMUM . Here, we call the adjustment step and MAXIMUM the allowed&#10;upper limit for the parameter to avoid over-adjustments that may lead to&#10;a significant increase in FNR. Each time when is updated, the Bayes&#10;threshold is updated accordingly. In Section \[sec:ThresholdChoice\], we&#10;will analyze the effect of the initial and maximum setting of . In&#10;Section \[sec:EVA-paramRefine\] we will discuss in details the effect of&#10;and on the performance of RADIUS and recommend the appropriate settings&#10;for an indoor environment.">
