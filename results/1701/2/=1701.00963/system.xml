<outline text="The RADIUS System Design" _note="In this section, we give an overview of the system design and the&#10;architecture of RADIUS, followed by the introduction of its major&#10;functional modules. In addition, we motivate the use of Bayesian&#10;thresholding in RADIUS to achieve minimal error rate and high robustness&#10;in detecting link quality anomalies, based on a comparison with the CDF&#10;thresholding and the Chebyshev thresholding techniques.">
  <outline text="RADIUS System Overview" _note="To achieve its goal, RADIUS adopts a hybrid approach. It comprises a set&#10;of distributed software modules located at the sensor nodes, which are&#10;called DETECTION AGENTS (DAs), to detect anomalous link quality&#10;degradation along routing paths. In addition, a central server, called&#10;VISUALIZER AND CONTROL CENTER (VCC), is used to monitor the performance&#10;of both the network and the RADIUS system. The overall system&#10;architecture of RADIUS is shown in Figure \[fig:architecture\].">
    <outline text="Two phases." _note="Similar to other anomaly detection systems, RADIUS runs in two phases: a&#10;training phase and an anomaly detection phase. During the TRAINING&#10;PHASE, the user first observes if the performance of the network, e.g.,&#10;packet delivery rate, is above the user requirement. In this case, each&#10;DA measures and collects the RSSI readings of the received packets to&#10;construct a “normal profile” for each monitored link, based on which a&#10;set of thresholds are generated. In the following ANOMALY DETECTION&#10;PHASE, each DA compares the runtime RSSI readings with the generated&#10;thresholds to detect if there is an anomalous link quality degradation.">

    <outline text="System modules." _note="Choosing an appropriate anomaly detection technique is the key to&#10;achieve high detection performance, especially when using the highly&#10;varying RSSI values to distinguish the good links (with low packet&#10;losses) from weak links (with high packet losses) as accurately as&#10;possible. To tackle this problem, RADIUS employs a thresholding&#10;technique based on the Bayes decision theory. Through the process of&#10;deciding a Bayes threshold, the detection error rate can be minimized,&#10;as to be discussed in Section \[sec:thdComputation\]. In a (close to)&#10;Gaussian channel, the computation of the Bayes threshold for a desired&#10;error only relies on a user-defined parameter (i.e. the A PRIORI&#10;probability in the Bayes formula) and two statistical measures (i.e. the&#10;[MEAN]{} and the [STANDARD DEVIATION]{}) of the measured RSSI values.&#10;&#10;During the training phase, the `Bayesian Thresholding Module` in each DA&#10;constructs the RSSI profiles (mean and standard deviation) of good&#10;links, and at the end of this phase, the module derives a Bayes&#10;threshold for each monitored link. Note that, although the detection&#10;error is minimized by employing the Bayesian thresholding technique, the&#10;detection error rate may still be high when the mean and standard&#10;deviation estimates are not accurate due to insufficient RSSI training&#10;samples. To alleviate this problem, RADIUS employs a&#10;`Training Set Size Estimation Module` before the threshold computation.&#10;In this module, we use a confidence interval to estimate for each link&#10;the number of minimal RSSI samples required to produce a good&#10;approximation of the true underlying distribution of the RSSI values and&#10;hence the mean and standard deviation. This module ensures a “good&#10;enough” quality of the first Bayes threshold while keeping an acceptable&#10;training set size to avoid an overly long training time.&#10;&#10;After the above operations, the anomaly detection phase starts. Recall&#10;that RADIUS is aimed to achieve high detection accuracy for links under&#10;diverse link conditions and be robust to environment changes. This is&#10;realized mainly by the `Basic Detection Module` and the&#10;`Training Set Update Module`. For the former, i.e. to achieve consistent&#10;high detection accuracy for different links, the system should avoid&#10;fine-tuning of the parameters involved in the thresholding, which&#10;specifically means no tuning of the A PRIORI probability for each&#10;individual link. For this purpose, the `Basic Detection Module` compares&#10;the runtime RSSI measurements after smoothing with the Bayes threshold&#10;to decide about whether there is an anomalous link quality degradation&#10;or not. Later in Section \[sec:ThresholdChoice\], we show that a&#10;near-optimal detection accuracy is possible for all links across the&#10;network by even a coarse choice of the A PRIORI probability setting. In&#10;addition, to cope with dynamic environment changes, the&#10;`Training Set Update Module` is introduced, which updates the RSSI&#10;training set continuously during the detection phase in a&#10;memory-efficient way.&#10;&#10;To further explore the potential of the A PRIORI probability parameter&#10;in achieving or maintaining the high detection accuracy, a&#10;feedback-based A PRIORI probability adaptation technique is introduced&#10;in RADIUS during the anomaly detection phase through the&#10;`A Priori Probability Refinement Module`. If the module in the VCC&#10;observes that the error rate of RADIUS for a link increases above a&#10;certain threshold, it then informs the SETTER at the DA to tune the&#10;setting of the A PRIORI probability.&#10;&#10;In summary, the DA on each sensor node monitors the link quality of the&#10;links used by the higher-layer network protocols and fire alarms to&#10;inform the VCC and the network administrator about detected anomalous&#10;link quality degradations. In the training phase, when the network&#10;performance satisfies the user requirements, each DA generates locally&#10;the best RSSI threshold using Bayesian thresholding&#10;(Section \[sec:thdComputation\]) for each monitored link after&#10;collecting enough samples as determined by the minimal training set size&#10;estimation (Section \[sec:minTrainingSet\]). In the detection phase,&#10;using the generated thresholds, each DA performs local detection&#10;including data smoothing (Section \[sec:dataSmoothing\]) and adaptively&#10;adjusts the threshold either with local information updating the&#10;training set (Section \[sec:trainingSetUpdate\]) or with the refinement&#10;of the A PRIORI probability by the feedback from the VCC&#10;(Section \[sec:prioriRefinement\]) to achieve high accuracy and&#10;robustness.">

    <outline text="Remarks." _note="In RADIUS, we have focused on using the RSSI link attribute to detect&#10;anomalous link quality degradation. However, its approach is not&#10;strictly limited to using RSSI, which may be extended to use other&#10;communication attributes as potential indicators of (possibly other&#10;types of) network performance anomalies. For instance, PACKET CRC ERROR&#10;RATE could be observed for identifying packet collisions, PACKET&#10;OVERFLOW RATE for indicating queuing losses, and PACKET INTER-ARRIVAL&#10;TIME for determining node crashes.">

  <outline text="Motivation of Bayesian Thresholding" _note="Before describing the details of the Bayesian thresholding technique, we&#10;first motivate and illustrate its need. Its ability to deal with the&#10;challenge of achieving minimized detection error in a noisy channel is&#10;then evaluated in comparison with the CDF-based (or Percentile-based)&#10;and Chebyshev inequality-based thresholding techniques.">
    <outline text="Achieving Minimal Detection Error" _note="Due to its stochastic nature, the quality of a WSN link can vary&#10;randomly. To illustrate this, Figure \[fig:PIMRC-RSSI\] presents two&#10;RSSI traces collected from a real WSN link. The upper one is when the&#10;link operated in a normal state with a packet delivery ratio (PDR)&#10;higher than 99% (i.e. good link), while the lower one is when the link&#10;operated in an abnormal state with PDR below 52% (i.e. weak link). The&#10;figure also shows that the two clusters of RSSI values, although mostly&#10;centred around their respective means, partially overlap with each other&#10;and no threshold can clearly discriminate them. This is due to the&#10;stochastic nature and the well-known temporal properties of low-power&#10;wireless links .&#10;&#10;An implication of Figure \[fig:PIMRC-RSSI\] is that no single RSSI&#10;threshold can, based on an RSSI value, lead to a definite conclusion&#10;without error if the link is in the good or weak state. Our objective is&#10;to find a threshold that minimizes the misidentification error. As shown&#10;in the figure, finding such a threshold involves a tradeoff decision to&#10;balance between reducing the chance that a good link is misidentified as&#10;a weak link and reducing the chance that a weak link is falsely viewed&#10;as a good link. The former is called false positive rate (FPR) and the&#10;latter called false negative rate (FNR).&#10;&#10;Mathematically, such a decision problem of finding the best threshold&#10;minimizing the error rate has been comprehensively studied under the&#10;Bayesian decision theory. In addition, if the monitored attribute is a&#10;Gaussian random variable (e.g., RSSI in a Gaussian channel), the&#10;complexity of Bayesian thresholding decreases significantly, falling&#10;within the limited capability of sensor nodes. This motivates our&#10;adoption of Bayesian thresholding in RADIUS.&#10;&#10;">

    <outline text="Comparison among Thresholding Techniques" _note="To illustrate the high accuracy and robustness achieved by a Bayesian&#10;thresholding based detection system, we compare the detection&#10;performance of Bayesian thresholding with that of two aforementioned&#10;popular statistical detection techniques in WSNs: CDF-based and&#10;Chebyshev-inequality based thresholding techniques, both of which have&#10;similar complexity as the Bayesian thresholding technique.&#10;&#10;In a CDF-based (or Percentile-based) detection scheme, the threshold is&#10;typically defined as the X-TH percentile of the underlying data&#10;distribution of the monitored attribute. For a Gaussian channel, the&#10;resulting threshold depends on the mean and standard deviation of the&#10;collected RSSI samples as well as on a parameter setting of the&#10;PERCENTILE defined by the user. The other thresholding technique often&#10;used in the literature of WSNs is the Chebyshev-inequality based&#10;technique. In this case, the threshold is defined as follows: where, in&#10;addition to the mean () and standard deviation () of the monitored&#10;attribute , is a user-defined parameter for the desired false positive&#10;rate. Similarly, the Bayes threshold for Gaussian random RSSI depends on&#10;the same statistical measures (mean and standard deviation) as the CDF&#10;and Chebyshev methods and hence incurs a similarly low computation and&#10;memory overhead. The main difference is the parameter involved in the&#10;computation of the Bayes threshold: the A PRIORI probability of a link&#10;being in a good state (, as to be discussed in Section&#10;\[sec:thdComputation\]).&#10;&#10;For this comparison, we evaluate the system performance in terms of&#10;accuracy and robustness, with a focus on how the performance is&#10;influenced by the user-defined parameters, namely the X-TH PERCENTILE&#10;for CDF thresholding, for Chebyshev thresholding and for Bayesian&#10;thresholding. The preferable technique is the one whose best detection&#10;accuracy performance is least sensitive to its parameter choice.&#10;Ideally, such a technique does not require fine-tuning of its parameter&#10;to achieve consistently optimal accuracy.&#10;&#10;We apply these three techniques individually to the same data traces&#10;collected from 5 different links in a network. The links are selected in&#10;such a way that diverse link conditions (e.g., line-of-sight,&#10;non-line-of-sight, no human movements or frequent movement etc.) are&#10;captured. We record the false positive rate (FPR) and false negative&#10;rate (FNR) for each technique. A detection decision is considered as&#10;false positive (false negative) when the technique declares that an RSSI&#10;anomaly is detected (not detected) while the packet delivery rate over&#10;the link is above (under) a minimum (e.g., 80%). The values of the above&#10;parameters of each method are varied in the same wide range of \[, \].&#10;The resultant overall detection error rate (sum of FPR and FNR) for the&#10;three methods are presented in Figure \[fig:EVA-ThdCompare\].&#10;&#10;From Figure \[fig:EVA-ThdCompare\], we can clearly see that the system&#10;performance with the Bayes threshold is consistently ROBUST for&#10;different links and is INSENSITIVE to the value of unless is approaching&#10;the extreme, i.e., 1. In contrast, the system performance of both&#10;Percentile-based and Chebyshev-based approaches dramatically varies with&#10;changing parameter values. Furthermore, the optimal for Chebyshev&#10;threshold with minimal detection error varies significantly from link to&#10;link. Instead, Bayesian thresholding with a global coarse setting of&#10;(e.g., any value from 0.1 to 0.9) for the analyzed 5 links provides&#10;close to the minimal detection error achieved by the Chebyshev&#10;thresholds. Finally, the accuracy with the Percentile threshold is in&#10;general worse than that with the Bayes threshold for every link with any&#10;parameter setting.&#10;&#10;An implication is that while CDF thresholding tends to provide tight&#10;RSSI bounds of good links for achieving a low FNR, it can easily cause a&#10;significantly high FPR in case of high randomness and temporal&#10;variations, making the technique difficult to achieve a low error rate.&#10;In addition, while Chebyshev thresholding can reach high detection&#10;accuracy, its performance highly depends on the choice of . Bayesian&#10;thresholding, on the other hand, is designed to minimize the detection&#10;error while at the same time it can use a single setting of the&#10;threshold parameter for the entire network, thus avoiding parameter&#10;tuning for every individual link. Thanks to such features, we employ&#10;Bayesian thresholding as the core detection technique in RADIUS. Details&#10;of Bayesian thresholding and the supporting techniques needed to use it&#10;are described in the following section.">
