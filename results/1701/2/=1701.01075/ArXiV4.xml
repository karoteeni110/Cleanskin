<outline text="Introduction" _note="Application of quantum field theory to condensed matter physics began in&#10;Soviet Union around 1956-57 . In this approach the Fermi sea serves as&#10;an analog of the relativistic quantum vacuum – the Dirac sea. The&#10;Gor’kov theory of superconductivity has been the fundamental step in&#10;this direction, which in turn triggered the development of the&#10;relativisic theories. The composite models developed by Nambu and&#10;Jona-Lasinio and by Vaks and Larkin , where the Higgs bosons appear as a&#10;composite states of the fermion pairs, are the direct consequences of&#10;the Gor’kov theory. In such models the original Weyl fermions of&#10;Standard Model (such as top quarks) play the role of the electrons in&#10;metals, while the composite Higgs bosons are analogs of the collective&#10;modes of the order parameter in superconductors.&#10;&#10;Here we consider another consequence of the Gor’kov theory of&#10;superconductivity, where the Weyl fermions emerge in superconductors as&#10;Bogoliubov quasiparticles. This in particular takes place for&#10;superconductors of the symmetry class , where the 4 left-handed and 4&#10;right-handed topologically protected chiral fermions emerge , see Fig.&#10;\[Cube\]. Expansion of the Gor’kov Green’s function in the vicinity of&#10;each topologically protected Weyl point leads to the effective&#10;relativistic quantum field theory with effective gauge fields and the&#10;effective gravity. This provides the hint for possible emergent origin&#10;of the “fundamental” Weyl fermions, gauge fields, and general relativity&#10;.&#10;&#10;\[Cube\]">

<outline text="Symmetry and topology" _note="The Gor’kov anomalous function and the ordinary Green’s function have&#10;been organized by Nambu in terms of the matrix Hamiltonian, and Gor’kov&#10;equations have been written in the more convinient matrix form. The&#10;corresponding Green’s function is Here is the complex gap function; are&#10;Pauli matrices, they operate in the particle-hole space and describe the&#10;effective spin emerging in the superconducting state – the&#10;Bogoliubov-Nambu-Gor’kov spin. This is in addition to the original spin&#10;of electrons, which we ignore here at the moment assuming for simplicity&#10;the spin singlet state of the Cooper pair.&#10;&#10;The symmetry classification of superconducting states demonstrates that&#10;the majority of supercoductivity classes contains the gapless&#10;superconductors, where the symmetry supports the point nodes and/or the&#10;nodal lines in the energy spectrum of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, for&#10;review see . Some of the nodal lines and points do not disappear even if&#10;the symmetry of the superconducting state is violated: such stability&#10;towards deformations of crystal is supported by the integer-valued&#10;topological invariant, which for the point nodes has been discussed in&#10;Ref. . This invariant reflects the topology of the Gor’kov-Nambu matrix&#10;Green’s function in the 3D momentum space or in the 4D&#10;momentum-frequency space .&#10;&#10;Since the topologically protected nodes in the energy spectrum determine&#10;the dynamics, kinetics, thermodynamics and anomalies in superconductors,&#10;the symmetry classification of superconducting states should be&#10;supplemented by the topological classification. The topological&#10;classification of nodes in the energy spectrum with and without the&#10;symmetry protection has been started , but still is not completed, see&#10;the latest reviews on symmetry and topology of superconducting and&#10;superfuid states .">

<outline text="Weyl and Dirac superconductors">
  <outline text="Weyl superconductors" _note="In order to make connection to the vacuum of quantum field theory, we&#10;consider the superconducting state in the crystals with the maximal&#10;possible symmetry – the cubic symmetry (note that as has been found by&#10;Gor’kov , even in the cubic crystals the upper critical field can be&#10;anisotropic). The state, where the gap nodes obtained from the symmetry&#10;consideration appear to be topologically stable, belongs to the&#10;superconducting class . This state contains 8 point nodes in the energy&#10;spectrum in Fig. \[Cube\], which are situated on the four symmetry axes&#10;in the Brillouin zone (the more general situation with the pockets of&#10;the Fermi surfaces see in Ref. ). Let us consider the gap function for&#10;the momentum along one of these threefold axes. The important property&#10;of the unconventional superconductivity discussed in , is that the&#10;symmetry group of the order parameter (or of the gap function ) contains&#10;the elements with combined symmetry. In particular, the symmetry group&#10;of the state contains the combined symmetry: . This combined symmetry&#10;means that the gap function does not change if the rotation of the&#10;momentum around one of the threefold axis is accompanied by the gauge&#10;transformation by the phase . Applying this to the gap function with&#10;momentum along the rotation axis one obtains : This gives for the&#10;momentum on the threefold axis.&#10;&#10;This can be visualized using the simple model Hamiltonian for fermions&#10;in the spin-singlet -wave superconductor in cubic crystal, which belongs&#10;to symmetry class. The gap function has the form The corresponding&#10;Gor’kov-Nambu Hamiltonian for fermions is The intersections of the lines&#10;of zeroes in the gap function, , with the Fermi surface, , give the&#10;point nodes in the energy spectrum. In the considered case of cubic&#10;symmetry of the crystal there are 8 point nodes at the vertices of cube&#10;in the momentum space in Fig. \[Cube\]:&#10;&#10;It appears that these zeroes in the energy spectrum do not disappear if&#10;the crystal is deformed and the cubic symmetry is violated. The reason&#10;for that is that these point nodes are topologically stable: they are&#10;supported by topological invariant, which takes values . This invariant&#10;is related to the winding number of the phase of the gap function around&#10;the nodal line in the gap function . It also represents the charge of&#10;the Berry phase monopoles in momentum space , and can be analytically&#10;expressed in terms of the Gor’kov-Green’s function : Here is the 3D&#10;surface around the point nodes of the inverse Green’s function in the 4D&#10;frequency-momentum space ; and denotes the trace over all the indices of&#10;the matrix (in addition to Bogoliubov-Nambu-Gor’kov spin index, the&#10;Green’s function contains also the ordinary spin index, band index in&#10;crystals, and indices of the fermionic species in particle physics). In&#10;a different form the topological stability of the Weyl nodes has been&#10;discussed for the neutrino sector in Refs. .&#10;&#10;The important property of the point nodes with is that close to each of&#10;8 nodes the Gor’kov-Nambu Hamiltonian is reduced to the Hamiltonian&#10;describing the Weyl fermions: Under space and time dependent&#10;deformations the expansion parameters become the fields. These are&#10;analogous to the tetrad field in general relativity acting on Weyl&#10;fermion. In the same way play the role of the effective gauge fields.&#10;&#10;Altogether the superconducting state contains 4 left-handed fermions ()&#10;and 4 right-handed fermions (). In case of Fermi pockets discussed in&#10;Ref. the number of Weyl fermions may increase. If the pockets are on the&#10;three-fold axes, one would have 8 left-handed and 8 right-handed&#10;fermions. This can be compared with 8 left-handed and 8 right-handed&#10;Weyl fermions in each generation of fermions in Standard Model of&#10;particle physics. The natural arrangement of the 8 left and 8 right Weyl&#10;fermions also occurs on the vertices of the cube in the four-dimensional&#10;space . This is one of many examples when the topologically protected&#10;nodes in the spectrum serve as an inspiration for the construction of&#10;the relativisitc quantum field theories.&#10;&#10;\[Cube2\]">

  <outline text="Dirac superconductors" _note="Topological stability of nodes in the spectrum is important, because it&#10;does not depend on the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity. On&#10;the other hand, the symmetry arguments are rather subtle, especially in&#10;case of complicated many-band structure of the Fermi surface and of the&#10;gap function, and also the symmetry can be violated. An example of state&#10;with unstable Fermi points is the triplet state of the symmetry class&#10;with Gor’kov-Nambu Green’s function where the vector gap function is&#10;Here are Pauli matrices for ordinary spin, and the energy spectrum in&#10;case of real vector .&#10;&#10;This state has point nodes . The zeroes are at the 8 points, where the&#10;Fermi surface intersects the four threefold axes, and in addition there&#10;are 6 points at the intersections of the Fermi surface with three&#10;fourfold axes, see Fig. \[Cube2\]. This state is time reversal invariant&#10;(the vector is real), and thus the nodes do not represent the Weyl&#10;points. These are the Dirac points, which are massless (gapless) only&#10;due the symmetry of the state, and can be destroyed by deformations of&#10;the crystal lattice. Depending on the type of the violated symmetry, the&#10;fermions may acquire the gap (mass), or instead the Dirac points split&#10;into the pairs of Weyl points . The first scenario takes place in&#10;Standard Model, with the possible exception in the neutrino sector,&#10;where the second scenario is still not excluded.&#10;&#10;The extension to the four-dimensional space with cubic symmetry gives&#10;Dirac points, which can be compared with 24 Dirac fermions in 3&#10;generations of Standard Model. The crystal symmetry of superconductors&#10;does not allow us to consider the point groups of higher symmetry, such&#10;as the icosahedral group and its 4D extensions. However, this can be&#10;extended by considering the symmetry groups in the internal isospin&#10;space .">

<outline text="Cuprates and Dirac nodal lines" _note="Though the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in&#10;cuprates remains unknown , the -wave order parameter symmetry and&#10;existence of the nodal lines are well established. Let us start with&#10;cuprates which have tetragonal symmetry. The superconducting state there&#10;belongs to the class . The relevant combined symmetry, which gives rise&#10;to the nodes in the spectrum, is . It is the rotation about the&#10;horizontal axis combined with the gauge transformation by phase . Under&#10;this combined transformation the gap function Here we used the symmetry&#10;element of the group in the third equality and the space inversion&#10;symmetry in the last one. The equation (\[U2\]) gives for momenta on the&#10;vertical plane . The same consideration shows that the gap function is&#10;zero also on another vertical plane, . As a result one obtains 4 nodal&#10;lines in the energy spectrum at the intersections of the Fermi surface&#10;with the two vertical symmetry planes, where . The corresponding&#10;Gor’kov-Nambu model Hamiltonian is These nodal lines survive if the&#10;tetragonal symmetry is distorted, but the time reversal symmetry is&#10;obeyed. The reason for that is again the topological stability. The&#10;nodal lines are protected by another topological invariant expressed via&#10;the general Gor’kov-Nambu Hamiltonian Here the integral is now along the&#10;loop around the nodal line in 3D momentum space.&#10;&#10;Recently the polar phase of superfluid He has been discovered, which has&#10;the spin degenerate nodal line in the energy spectrum .">

<outline text="Physical consequences of gap nodes in superconductors" _note="The nodes in the spectrum lead to the finite density of states (DoS) in&#10;the presence of the superfluid velocity, this is because the nodes&#10;expand due to the Doppler shift and form the Fermi surface pockets&#10;around the former nodes. Due to the superflow around Abrikosov vortices,&#10;the Fermi pockets produce the singular dependence of the DoS on magnetic&#10;field. The point nodes lead to the DoS, which is proportional to .&#10;Integration over the cross section of the Abrikosov vortices gives the&#10;dependence of DoS in the vortex lattice . In case of the line nodes the&#10;DoS has linear dependence on , see Ref. , and correspondingly one&#10;obtains the dependence of DoS in the Abrikosov lattice . This square&#10;root dependence of DoS has been observed in cuprates .&#10;&#10;The systems with Weyl fermions should experience the chiral anomaly&#10;effect in the external fields or in the effective gauge fields produced&#10;by deformations. The latter has been observed in chiral superfluid He-A&#10;as an extra force acting on vortex-skyrmions . This is the spectral flow&#10;force or the Kopnin force, see e.g. Ref. . It can be expressed in terms&#10;of the effective “magnetic” and “electric” fields acting on Weyl&#10;fermions. These fields are produced by deformation in superconductors,&#10;or by the moving skyrmion texture in He-A . The Kopnin force is&#10;proportional to , and the measured coefficient in front of was found to&#10;be in agreement with the Adler-Bell-Jackiw equation , desribing&#10;production of the fermionic charge generated by the chiral anomaly.&#10;&#10;The topologicaly protected point and line nodes in the energy spectrum&#10;lead to the fermion zero modes in the core of vortices and to the&#10;topologically protected gapless edge states. This is the result of the&#10;so-called bulk-surface and bulk-vortex topological correspondence. The&#10;Weyl fermions in bulk produce the dispersionless flat band of fermions&#10;with zero energy living in the vortex core and the Fermi arc of the edge&#10;states . The nodal lines in bulk superconductors lead to the&#10;condensation of the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon levels in the vortex and&#10;to the flat band of the edge states .&#10;&#10;The dimensional reduction of the 3D superconducting states with Weyl&#10;fermions to the 2D or quasi-3D films leads to the two-dimensional fully&#10;gapped superconductivity without the gap nodes, which however retains&#10;the nontrivial topological character. The topological invariant for&#10;these 2D superconductors is obtained by dimensional reduction of&#10;Eq.(\[N3\]) for the Weyl point. It is expressed in terms of&#10;Gor’kov-Nambu matrix Green’s function, but the integration now is over&#10;the frequency (on the imaginary axis) and over the 2D Brillouin zone,&#10;see Refs. : Here . The Abrikosov vortex in such 2D superconductors&#10;contains in its core the Majorana fermion with zero energy .">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="The majority of the topological classes of superconductivity contain the&#10;topologically protected Weyl points. Expansion of the Gor’kov-Nambu&#10;matrix Green’s function in the vicinity of each Weyl point leads to the&#10;effective relativistic quantum field theory with effective gauge fields&#10;and effective gravity. In this analogy different Weyl points correspond&#10;to different fermionic species of Standard Model - quarks and lepton.&#10;The effective quantum field theory in the vicinity of the nodal line is&#10;still waiting for its development, as well as in the vicinity of nodes&#10;of arbitrary co-dimension. Probably this may have relation to branes in&#10;string theory .">
