<outline text="Overview" _note="The approach reviewed in the paper is advantageous, in particular, in&#10;problems with many open channels of various nature i.e. when energy is&#10;not low. Conventional approaches dealing with continuum wave functions&#10;are impractical in such problems at least at A. The approach was&#10;successfully applied in nuclear reaction problems with A and also&#10;recently for A=12 and 16 proceeding from NN or NN+NNN forces. Many cases&#10;of reactions induced by a perturbation, i.e. electromagnetic or weak&#10;interaction, were considered. Both inclusive (mostly) and exclusive&#10;processes were studied. Reactions induced by strong interaction still&#10;were not considered although this can be done in a similar way, see&#10;below.&#10;&#10;The main features of the approach are the following. In a dynamics&#10;calculation in its framework there is no need to specify reaction&#10;channels [AT ALL]{}. These come into play at merely the kinematics level&#10;and only after a dynamics calculation is done. Such a calculation is of&#10;the bound–state type.&#10;&#10;Correspondingly, continuum spectrum states never enter the game. In&#10;place of them, “response–like” functions, of the type of Eq. (\[r\])&#10;below, are basic ingredients of the approach. Reaction observables are&#10;expressed in terms of these functions as quadratures, see Eqs. (\[t\]) –&#10;(\[r1\]) below. It should also be noted that in some problems of&#10;importance the quantities of Eq. (\[r\]) form are of interest themselves&#10;representing observable response functions for inclusive&#10;perturbation–induced reactions.&#10;&#10;And the required “response–like” functions of Eq. (\[r\]) form are&#10;obtained not in terms of the complicated continuum spectrum states&#10;entering their definition but via a bound–state type calculation. As the&#10;first step, an integral transform of such a function is performed. The&#10;transform is found in a closed form and represents a “continuum sum&#10;rule” depending on a parameter, Eq. (\[inteq\]). It is evaluated via a&#10;bound–state type calculation. As the next step, this sum rule is&#10;considered as an equation determining the “response–like” function, i.e.&#10;its inversion is performed. Once this is done, the above mentioned&#10;quadratures giving the reaction observables are readily obtained.&#10;&#10;Thus, as claimed above, the specification of reaction channels in the&#10;dynamics calculation and dealing with continuum wave functions are&#10;avoided in this approach. The criterion of accuracy is stability of&#10;response–like function obtained.&#10;&#10;In addition to checking the stability, comparisons with more&#10;conventional calculations that deal with continuum wave functions have&#10;been performed. In the benchmark paper the Faddeev results for the H&#10;photoabsorption total cross section are compared with the results&#10;obtained via the above described approach. In the framework of this&#10;approach, the Lorentz integral transform (LIT), see the next section,&#10;was used. The Argonne V18 NN interaction and the Urbana IX NNN potential&#10;have been employed. The results are shown in Fig. 1.&#10;&#10;A compete agreement is observed in the case when only the NN force is&#10;retained while in the case when the NNN force is added such an agreement&#10;is observed everywhere except for the peak region where a slight&#10;difference is present. In Ref. the LIT results in the same problem have&#10;been obtained employing expansions over two different bases at solving&#10;the dynamics equation, the correlated hyperspherical basis (CHH) and the&#10;effective interaction hyperspherical basis (EIHH). The results are shown&#10;in Fig. 2.&#10;&#10;These results practically coincide with each other which testifies to&#10;that the LIT results in Fig. 1 b) are accurate.&#10;&#10;In Fig. 3 one more test is presented . The total cross section of the&#10;He(,p)d reaction in the threshold region is calculated in two ways, from&#10;the LIT, as above, and via a direct calculation of the pd continuum wave&#10;functions. In this case, there is no real need for use of the method of&#10;integral transforms since the problem is a one–channel one. Another&#10;point is that the problem considered is unfavorable for this method&#10;since the cross section at the threshold is tiny and the values of the&#10;response function at such energies contribute extremely little to the&#10;integral pertaining to the corresponding integral equation of Eq.&#10;(\[inteq\]) and therefore to the input to solve the equation. Despite&#10;this, a complete agreement of the results of the two methods is&#10;observed. This is most clearly seen from Fig. 3 (b) where the quickly&#10;varying Gamow factor is factored out from the cross section, and the&#10;remaining astrophysical –factor is presented. The central Malfliet–Tjon&#10;NN potential was employed in this calculation. Let us also mention that&#10;the pd continuum wave functions that have led to the results in Fig. 3&#10;provide phase shifts practically coinciding with those of the other&#10;group .&#10;&#10;In the next section basic points of the approach are presented, and Sec.&#10;3 contains further comments.">

<outline text="Basics of the Method" _note="Let us consider “response–like” quantities having the structure Here and&#10;denote, respectively, bound states and continuum spectrum states with&#10;energies and pertaining to the Hamiltonian of a problem. The subscript&#10;labeling the states may include both continuous and discrete variables&#10;which is reflected in the sum over integral symbol. The set of states is&#10;complete which may be written in the form where is the identity&#10;operator. This implies the normalizations and . As said above, in the&#10;present approach reaction observables are expressed in terms of&#10;quantities (\[r\]) as quadratures. First we shall discuss this point.&#10;After that, the above mentioned evaluation of quantities (\[r\]) via&#10;bound–state methods will be outlined.&#10;&#10;Consider the case of a reaction induced by strong interaction. Let be&#10;the product of bound states of fragments and of a factor representing&#10;their free relative motion in the initial state. Let be such products&#10;pertaining to final states. Let us denote the operator of&#10;antisymmetrization with . So that and are the antisymmetrized&#10;“free–motion” states . Let us use the notation and where is the&#10;Hamiltonian. This may be written as and where are interactions between&#10;fragments pertaining to a channel. These interactions are assumed here&#10;to be of a short range. The point on long–range inter–fragment Coulomb&#10;interactions is commented below.&#10;&#10;The reaction matrix is . Here denotes the Born contribution, The problem&#10;lies in calculating the non–Born contribution involving the Green&#10;function . Let us introduce the quantity This quantity has the same&#10;structure as that in Eq. (\[r\]) (with the replacement ). And the&#10;contribution to the matrix we discuss may readily be calculated in its&#10;terms as Thus, indeed, reaction cross sections may be expressed in terms&#10;of the “response–like” quantities of Eq. (\[r\]) as quadratures.&#10;&#10;The amplitude of a perturbation–induced reaction is where is a&#10;perturbation, is an unperturbed initial bound state, and is a continuum&#10;spectrum state. To calculate this amplitude let us substitute the&#10;expression in it. Then and one may proceed as above with the replacement&#10;there.&#10;&#10;A modification of the above relations required to incorporate the&#10;long–range inter–fragment Coulomb interactions is outlined in Ref. .&#10;(And if the response function itself is the objective of a calculation&#10;then the Coulomb interaction requires no special consideration as seen&#10;from below.) This modification leads to modified and states which&#10;include Coulomb functions in the inner region of the relative motion of&#10;fragments. Of course, it is very easy to obtain such Coulomb functions&#10;in the case of two–fragment reaction channels.&#10;&#10;Now we need to consider the calculation of quantities having the&#10;“response–like” structure of Eq. (\[r\]). We write them as The main&#10;problem consists in calculating the contribution (\[f\]). And this&#10;should be done avoiding the calculation of multiparticle continuum&#10;states entering it.&#10;&#10;First let us list the simple sum–rule result. With the help of&#10;Eq. (\[i\]) one obtains Here is the continuum spectrum threshold value&#10;so that varies in the range . While this single sum rule does not&#10;determine , this goal can be achieved with the help of “generalized”&#10;sums of the form depending on a continuous parameter. They are equal to&#10;Taking into account Eq. (\[i\]) this quantity can be represented as&#10;where, as above, is the Hamiltonian of a problem. Thus, one comes to the&#10;relation where and are the continuous part of the response–like function&#10;and discrete contributions to it, see Eqs. (\[f\]) and (\[c2\]). Since&#10;this relation is valid for any  it may be considered as an equation to&#10;determine , i.e. and , provided that one is able to calculate the&#10;quantity . At many kernels this equation determines and in a unique way.">

<outline text="Further comments" _note="Thus the equation of Eq. (\[inteq\]) form is to be solved. First, one&#10;needs to calculate its right–hand side input. If one is able to&#10;diagonalize the Hamiltonian on a sufficiently big subspace of basis&#10;functions this can be readily done. In this case, one can use the&#10;approximation of the type Here is the dimension of the subspace and&#10;other notation is obvious. Suppose, for example, that the kernel is&#10;employed. At a given accuracy in the input , smaller values would lead&#10;to a better reproduction of details of at solving Eq. (\[inteq\]).&#10;Indeed, at large values, contributions to from peculiarities of are&#10;spread over large intervals, and sizes of these contributions may be&#10;comparable with sizes of inaccuracies in calculated . At the same time,&#10;smaller values require use of subspaces of basis functions of higher&#10;dimension. Indeed, accurate values emerge only at such sizes of these&#10;subspaces that (at values of significance) energy ranges contain&#10;sufficiently many eigenvalues.&#10;&#10;The right–hand side of Eq. (\[discr\]) represents the result of&#10;smoothing the pseudo–response with the help of the smoothing function .&#10;Such type smoothings were performed in the literature and their results&#10;were considered as approximations to true responses for&#10;perturbation–induced inclusive reactions. In the difference to this, in&#10;the present approach such results are not adopted to be approximations&#10;to true responses. Here they play the role of the input to the integral&#10;equation and final true responses emerge as its solution. This&#10;refinement makes possible to obtain consistent and more accurate&#10;results.&#10;&#10;At some choices of the kernel it is possible to calculate the input to&#10;Eq. (\[inteq\]) also without the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. The&#10;simplest case is the Stieltjes kernel where is real and lies apart from&#10;the spectrum of a Hamiltonian. In this case one has I.e. is the solution&#10;to the inhomogeneous Schrödinger–like equation From the fact that is&#10;finite it follows that the solution is localized, and such a solution is&#10;unique. Another case is the so called Lorentz kernel Writing one reduces&#10;the calculation in this case to that in the Stiltjes one but with&#10;complex kernels. The solutions to the correponding Eq. (\[seq\]) type&#10;equations are localized and unique also in this case.&#10;&#10;Since the Lorentz kernel has a limited range, inversion of the transform&#10;is more accurate in the Lorentz case than that in the Stiltjes case at&#10;the same accuracy in the input, c.f. the reasoning above. Still, when an&#10;expansion over a basis is applied to solve Eq. (\[seq\]) type equations,&#10;convergence of in the Stiltjes case is faster than that in the Lorentz&#10;case with a small . Indeed, at the continuum spectrum regime is&#10;recovered at values of interest belonging to the scattering line.&#10;&#10;One more case is the Laplace kernel . The corresponding input can be&#10;calculated with the Green Function Monte Carlo method.&#10;&#10;We shall not discuss here the point of solving Eq. (\[inteq\]), i.e. the&#10;inversion of the transform, referring for this to the literature. Let us&#10;mention only that such an equation represents a classical “ill–posed&#10;problem”. (This does not mean at all that the problem is a very&#10;difficult one!) A standard regularization procedure was applied in&#10;practical calculations and convergent results have been obtained. Still,&#10;with such a procedure a sufficient accuracy of the input may be harder&#10;to achieve in problems with not small number of particles. A new method&#10;to solve Eq. (\[inteq\]) was proposed recently . In this method, the&#10;number of maxima and minima of the solution sought for is imposed as an&#10;additional constraint. The method does not require a regularization. It&#10;has been proved that the method is convergent at least everywhere except&#10;for the points of maxima and minima of . Thus, apart from this&#10;restriction, the problem becomes a well–posed one with the constraint&#10;imposed. With the same approximate inputs the method provides far more&#10;accurate results than the standard regularization procedure in simple&#10;examples considered. But its further study is still required.&#10;&#10;The discrete contributions in Eq. (\[inteq\]) may be calculated&#10;separately. For a convenient way to do this in the case of the Lorentz&#10;or Stiltjes transform see . Another option is the following. The general&#10;algorythm applied at solving Eq. (\[inteq\]) consisted in writing an&#10;ansatz for that included parameters and in fitting the parameters to .&#10;The amplitudes and, if expedient, energies may be included in the set of&#10;such parameters.&#10;&#10;A limitation of the present approach is that in order to reproduce fine&#10;details of spectra of reactions, such as the widths of narrow&#10;resonances, an increased accuracy in the input is required. The reason&#10;is the same as that discussed above in connection with Eq. (\[discr\]).&#10;This feature is similar to the situation with extracting widths of&#10;narrow resonances from experiments in which scattering or reaction cross&#10;sections are measured. Still, narrow resonances are normally located at&#10;low energy whereas the present method is designed for calculations of&#10;reactions when many channels are open, i.e. not at low energy. Then&#10;information on the widths of narrow resonaces taken from experiment or&#10;from alternative calculations may be readily incorporated in an&#10;algorythm of solving Eq. (\[inteq\]). And, anyway, inaccuracies in&#10;widths of resonances at low energy in the present method would not lead&#10;to inaccuracies at reproducing reaction spectra at higher energy. In&#10;addition, in the light nuclei case widths of resonances are normally not&#10;so narrow. In Ref. the width about 200 KeV of such a resonance in He was&#10;reproduced with a reasonable accuracy in the framework of the present&#10;approach. See also Fig. 3 above in this regard.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the relevant literature is listed in addition to the&#10;references above. The approach to calculate reactions described in Sec.&#10;2 has been introduced in Ref. . Its presentation here is close to Ref. .&#10;The bound–state type, i.e. sum–rule, calculation of integral transforms&#10;of observable responses , i.e. pertaining to inclusive&#10;perturbation–induced reactions, has been suggested in considering the&#10;Stieltjes transform and in in the Laplace transform case. No inversions&#10;of the transforms were considered there. An alternative approach was&#10;also developed in which an observable is reconstructed from its moments&#10;of the type , . The quantity of Eq. (\[s\]) represents then the zero&#10;moment. Subsequent moments are calculated recursively. That approach&#10;referred only to the case of inclusive perturbation–induced reactions,&#10;in the difference to the above described method of treatment of&#10;general–type reactions, i.e. exclusive perturbation– and strong&#10;interaction–induced ones. The described way to calculate involving&#10;Eq. (\[discr\]) was suggested in Ref. (although at too restrictive&#10;conditions imposed on and ). Prior to this such a calculation of the&#10;Lorentz transform in a particular problem has been performed by I.J.&#10;Thompson. The Lorentz transform has been introduced in the present&#10;context in Ref. . Its evaluation in the form listed above was given in&#10;Ref. . In Ref. an efficient algorythm to calculate at solving Eq.&#10;(\[seq\]) with the help of an expansion over basis functions was&#10;developed. In the review papers and the subject of the transform&#10;inversion in the framework of the customary approach is considered, in&#10;particular. In Ref. earlier applications done with the help of the&#10;Lorentz transform are reviewed as well. Among later applications,&#10;advances in study of heavier nuclei are to be mentioned. Existing&#10;bound–state techniques to solve the multiparticle scattering problem are&#10;reviewed in Ref. .&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;J. Golak, W. Glöckle, H. Kamada, A. Nogga, R. Skibiński, H.
