<outline text="Introduction" _note="Parametric processes offer a range of important potential applications&#10;in future all-optical communication systems: low-noise phase-insensitive&#10;and phase-sensitive amplification ; the ability to regenerate noisy&#10;optical signals ; and alteration of the temporal mode profile as well as&#10;the frequency of optical quantum states, while preserving other&#10;properties of the quantum state of light . The third-order nonlinearity&#10;of optical fibers has been shown to enable tunable frequency conversion&#10;by four-wave mixing (FWM) in a special configuration known as Bragg&#10;scattering (BS) . In BS, one uses two pumps p and q, which interact with&#10;a signal s and an idler i fulfilling energy conservation , where is the&#10;angular frequency of the electric field for , see Fig. \[fig\_1\]. Even&#10;though BS is driven by two strong pumps, the process has been predicted&#10;by analytic quantum approaches to be free of additional quantum noise as&#10;opposed to phase-insensitive parametric amplifiers or Raman and&#10;Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, where amplified spontaneous emission&#10;induce a 3-dB noise figure (NF) in the high gain limit. These&#10;predictions are based on FWM being effectively phase-matched and the&#10;only influence on the wave components. However, material and waveguide&#10;dispersion of the third-order nonlinear device in which BS is realized&#10;may induce a significant phase mismatch and thereby reduce the&#10;conversion to take place in a confined frequency window. Also, amorphous&#10;materials such as silica and chalcogenide () have broad Raman response&#10;spectra that typically extend beyond this limit of phase matching .&#10;Finally, attenuation in the nonlinear medium reduces the efficiency of&#10;BS and therefore limits the achievable output.&#10;&#10;BS has been studied extensively for both classical and quantum signals ,&#10;and the effects of stimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS and&#10;SpRS) have been studied in parametric amplifiers and for photon-pair&#10;generation by degenerate four-wave mixing , but little attention has&#10;been given to their impacts on frequency conversion using BS, which is&#10;mainly due to the difficulty of implementing Raman scattering in quantum&#10;descriptions of FWM.&#10;&#10;(-6,0)–(-3.2,0); (-4.6,0.1)–(-4.6,-0.1) node \[below\] []{}; at&#10;(-4.6,-0.75) [(a)]{}; (-2.95,0)–(-0.15,0); (-1.55,0.1)–(-1.55,-0.1) node&#10;\[below\] []{}; at (-1.55,-0.75) [(b)]{}; (3.2,0)–(6,0) node \[below&#10;right\] []{}; (4.6,0.1)–(4.6,-0.1) node \[below\] []{}; at (4.6,-0.75)&#10;[(d)]{}; (2.95,0)–(0.15,0); (1.55,0.1)–(1.55,-0.1) node \[below\] []{};&#10;at (1.55,-0.75) [(c)]{};&#10;&#10;(-5.7,0)–(-5.7,0.75); at (-5.7,-0.25) [i]{}; (-5.3,0)–(-5.3,0.75); at&#10;(-5.3,-0.25) [s]{}; (-3.9,0)–(-3.9,1.5); at (-3.9,-0.25) [p]{};&#10;(-3.5,0)–(-3.5,1.5); at (-3.5,-0.25) [q]{};&#10;&#10;(-2.65,0)–(-2.65,1.5); at (-2.65,-0.25) [p]{}; (-2.25,0)–(-2.25,1.5); at&#10;(-2.25,-0.25) [q]{}; (-0.85,0)–(-0.85,0.75); at (-0.85,-0.25) [i]{};&#10;(-0.45,0)–(-0.45,0.75); at (-0.45,-0.25) [s]{};&#10;&#10;(5.7,0)–(5.7,0.75); at (5.7,-0.25) [s]{}; (5.3,0)–(5.3,1.5); at&#10;(5.3,-0.25) [q]{}; (3.9,0)–(3.9,0.75); at (3.9,-0.25) [i]{};&#10;(3.5,0)–(3.5,1.5); at (3.5,-0.25) [p]{};&#10;&#10;(2.65,0)–(2.65,1.5); at (2.65,-0.25) [q]{}; (2.25,0)–(2.25,0.75); at&#10;(2.25,-0.25) [s]{}; (0.85,0)–(0.85,1.5); at (0.85,-0.25) [p]{};&#10;(0.45,0)–(0.45,0.75); at (0.45,-0.25) [i]{};&#10;&#10;(-5.7,1)–(-5.3,1); (-5.7,1.07)–(-5.7,0.93); (-5.3,1.07)–(-5.3,0.93); at&#10;(-5.5,1.3) []{};&#10;&#10;(-5.7,1)–(-5.3,1); (-5.7,1.07)–(-5.7,0.93); (-5.3,1.07)–(-5.3,0.93); at&#10;(-5.5,1.3) []{};&#10;&#10;(-2.25,1)–(-1.55,1); (-2.25,1.07)–(-2.25,0.93);&#10;(-1.55,1.07)–(-1.55,0.93); at (-1.9,2) []{};&#10;&#10;(-2.25,1)–(-1.55,1); (-2.25,1.07)–(-2.25,0.93);&#10;(-1.55,1.07)–(-1.55,0.93); at (-1.9,2) []{};&#10;&#10;In this paper, we use a semi-classical approach to produce realistic&#10;predictions for the conversion efficiency (CE) and noise properties of&#10;BS in silica-based highly nonlinear fibers. The semi-classical approach&#10;simulates coherent states by classical field ensembles that display&#10;correct Gaussian statistics. One ensemble for each wave component is&#10;then propagated through the classical equations describing FWM including&#10;dispersion, loss, and Raman scattering. During propagation in the fiber,&#10;fluctuations are added to the ensemble, which account for spontaneous&#10;emission, and thus distort the performance of the FWM process. Note that&#10;such semi-classical approaches can predict the quantum noise properties&#10;of classical signals but they do not capture the quantum nature of&#10;single-photon states.&#10;&#10;In Fig. \[fig\_1\], four possible frequency configurations of BS are&#10;shown: in (a) and (b), the signal and idler are placed on the Stokes (S)&#10;and anti-Stokes (aS) side of the two pumps, respectively; (c) and (d)&#10;offer alternative configurations that have the same FWM properties but&#10;different Raman interaction. For all four setups, is the frequency&#10;separation between the two components of each side-bands, and is the&#10;separation between the zero-dispersion frequency, , and the closest wave&#10;component on either side of . It is implied that the waves are placed&#10;symmetrically around to obtain phase matching independent on the&#10;dispersion slope of the fiber. In this work, we investigate only the two&#10;setups (a) and (b).&#10;&#10;This paper is structured as follows: in Sec. 2, the classical&#10;propagation equations that describe FWM, SRS and loss in a fiber are&#10;derived and the approach for semi-classical modeling of quantum noise is&#10;outlined. In Sec. 3, we investigate the effects of fiber attenuation&#10;using realistic physical parameters. Finally in Sec. 4, we quantify the&#10;combined effects of FWM, SRS, and SpRS, and we show that Raman&#10;scattering has a significant impact on both the CE and noise properties&#10;of BS in a typical highly nonlinear silica fiber.">

  <outline text="Propagation equations of FWM and Raman scattering" _note="Equations that describe the propagation of an electromagnetic field&#10;through nonlinear optical fibers including the effects of both FWM and&#10;Raman scattering can be derived directly from Maxwell’s equations; using&#10;the approach of , a general propagation equation in a single mode&#10;nonlinear fiber for the amplitude of a continuous-wave electric field, ,&#10;at frequency is where is the propagation constant at frequency , and is&#10;the position vector where is the longitudinal coordinate in the fiber&#10;and and are the transverse coordinates. In the derivation of Eq. , the&#10;total electric field was expanded in a set of continuous-wave components&#10;where is a three-component vector holding the transverse field&#10;distribution functions of the three spatial components of the electric&#10;field, and is a normalization constant defined as where is the same for&#10;the magnetic field as is for the electric field. For a linearly&#10;polarized field, , where is a unit vector pointing in the transverse&#10;direction x in the fiber, is calculated to be where is the effective&#10;refractive index at frequency . The time-independent third order&#10;nonlinear induced polarization in Eq. is defined in terms of the total&#10;third order nonlinear induced polarization as The total nonlinear&#10;induced polarization is written as where the vertical dots denote the&#10;third order tensor product. The third order response function including&#10;both FWM and Raman scattering is , under the assumption that only one&#10;term of the third order susceptibility, , is non-zero, where is the&#10;total third order susceptibility, is the Raman fraction, and is the&#10;Raman response function.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we consider four frequency components that are connected&#10;through energy conservation and they interact through both FWM and Raman&#10;scattering. Inserting Eq. into Eq. , collecting terms in Eq. that&#10;oscillate at where , then using Eq. to insert into Eq. , and finally&#10;using Eq. , the propagation equation for the field amplitude at is&#10;derived, where is the nonlinear refractive index, is the usual effective&#10;area of the nonlinear fiber , is the phase mismatch elaborated below&#10;(note that in the equations of and , the sign in front of is opposite),&#10;and is the Fourier transform of evaluated at . The linear loss term with&#10;coefficient has been added and it is assumed common for all frequencies.&#10;&#10;Equation and the corresponding equations of through are applied to case&#10;(a) in Fig. \[fig\_1\] by setting , , , and , and similarly for case&#10;(b). The time-domain Raman response function can be approximated by a&#10;single damped oscillator function , but it turns out that such a simple&#10;description is not accurate for SpRS close to the pumps. Therefore, we&#10;use an extended response function, where the coefficients , , , and are&#10;determined in and valid for a silica-core fiber , and is the heaviside&#10;step function for which for and for . To implement Eq. in Eq. , the&#10;Fourier transform is applied and the resulting imaginary part is used&#10;while the real part is disregarded for simplicity. According to a&#10;significant effect of the real part of the Raman susceptibility is only&#10;observed when using a strong pulsed pump; the comparatively weak&#10;continuous-wave pumps used in this paper justify neglecting the real&#10;part of the Raman susceptibility.&#10;&#10;By expanding the wave-number of each wave component in a Taylor series&#10;around the zero-dispersion frequency, the phase-mismatch is written in&#10;terms of and from Fig. \[fig\_1\] as Because of the symmetry of the BS&#10;configuration around the zero-dispersion frequency, all odd dispersion&#10;terms cancel, which means is the lowest one that is used in the&#10;calculations. If we consider only the FWM terms, it is instructive to&#10;express the CE in terms of the phase mismatch. We assume the two strong&#10;pumps to have constant amplitudes such that where and are the constant&#10;pump powers and . By solving the resulting equations for the signal and&#10;idler, neglecting loss and Raman scattering, one easily finds where is&#10;the effective nonlinear strength, is the phase-mismatched conversion&#10;coefficient, and where the first ‘’ (second ‘’) corresponds to case (a)&#10;and (c) of Fig. \[fig\_1\], and the first ‘’ (second ‘’) corresponds to&#10;(b) and (d). Maximum conversion from signal to idler is achieved for ,&#10;which gives , which further is the same as full conversion in photon&#10;numbers. This condition can be met experimentally by adjusting the&#10;difference in pump powers to counter-balance the phase mismatch if the&#10;values of and are not too large relative to the fourth-order dispersion.&#10;Alternatively, a broad bandwidth of phase matching can be achieved&#10;through dispersion engineering, as demonstrated recently in a dispersion&#10;shifted fiber , or special phase matching properties across small or&#10;large bandwidths can be achieved using higher order modes. If is valid,&#10;one may, with a few simplifying assumptions, derive an approximate&#10;analytic expression for the CE where Raman scattering and loss are&#10;included. In the pump equations, energy exchange terms, cross-phase&#10;modulation terms of the signal and idler, the effect of loss on the&#10;phase modulation terms of the pumps, and the Raman interaction between&#10;the pumps are disregarded. In the signal and idler equations, only the&#10;small phase modulation terms of the signal and idler are disregarded.&#10;The CE from signal to idler becomes (after some calculations) where is&#10;the phase matched conversion coefficient, is the effective position in&#10;the fiber, and and are the Raman contributions to the signal and idler,&#10;respectively. In Eq. , it was assumed that , which is valid for typical&#10;lengths of highly nonlinear fibers.">

On the aS side, the&#10;corresponding expression is The -term in Eq. means that SpRS on the S&#10;side does not require any phonons present but on the aS side the -term&#10;gives SpRS a proportional dependence on the number of phonons. We define&#10;the rates of SpRS for the S and aS processes as and , respectively, and&#10;they are plotted in Fig. \[fig\_2\], which shows these quantities at&#10;room (solid blue) and at liquid nitrogen (dashed red) temperature versus&#10;frequency shift from one of the pumps, p or q. In contrast to SRS, the&#10;rate of SpRS is asymmetric around the pump, which is important to&#10;consider when small signals are situated simultaneously on both sides of&#10;the pump, e.g. as they may be in FWM. Lowering the temperature reduces&#10;the rate of SpRS significantly on the aS side as expected, whereas on&#10;the S side a significant reduction occurs only close to the pump.">

  <outline text="Simulating quantum noise classically [sec_23]" _note="The quantum noise properties of parametric processes can be predicted by&#10;semi-classical methods . One approach is to create field ensembles for&#10;simulating quantum coherent states at the input of the fiber and then&#10;propagate each element of the ensemble through classical equations (as&#10;derived in the previous section) in parallel; while propagating through&#10;the fiber, fluctuations must be added to the ensembles at every&#10;numerical step to account for SpRS and loss . The inherent fluctuations&#10;of a quantum field is represented in the ensemble, and the&#10;signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is evaluated as where is the complex valued&#10;classical field ensemble and Var() denotes the ensemble variance. The&#10;induced noise figure (NF) is then defined as . The induced NF for the BS&#10;process is defined as , i.e. the SNR of the signal at the input relative&#10;to the SNR of the idler at the output. A coherent state is simulated&#10;classically by defining the field amplitude ensemble as where and are&#10;the quadrature fluctuation variables that follow Gaussian distributions&#10;with the properties and , and is the mean field power. The variables and&#10;are the quadrature mean values, and the last term, , is the explicit&#10;inclusion of the vacuum state energy, which is an artifact of the&#10;semi-classical model. The magnitude, however, is so small that no&#10;significant error in the mean field power can be observed. To obtain&#10;reliable statistics, we use ensembles of elements in all simulations.&#10;&#10;By propagating the ensemble of Eq. through the classical equations&#10;derived in the previous section, the quantum noise associated with the&#10;FWM process is captured . When the field ensemble is subject to loss&#10;through the fiber, fluctuations must be added to each quadrature of all&#10;field elements to ensure that the mean field power of the field ensemble&#10;converge toward the value of , the vacuum energy explicitly included in&#10;the ensemble, instead of zero. The loss fluctuation follows a Gaussian&#10;distribution with the statistical properties where is an infinitesimal&#10;piece of fiber in which the attenuation takes place, e.g. the numerical&#10;step size. The variance of the loss fluctuation in Eq. ensures that the&#10;mean power of the ensemble that undergoes a large loss converges towards&#10;. SpRS is included by adding another fluctuation to each quadrature of&#10;all field elements in the ensemble. Because the rates of SpRS on the S&#10;and aS sides are unequal, different fluctuation terms must be assigned&#10;to them: on the S side of a wave component of power , the fluctuation&#10;must be added to each quadrature of a field with the properties&#10;(calculated in the Appendix) where and depend on the frequency shift as&#10;explained above and is assumed small. On the aS side of wave component ,&#10;the corresponding fluctuation, , has the properties&#10;&#10;(3.5,1.5)–(5.75,1.5); (3.75,1.25)–(3.75,3.5);&#10;&#10;(4.75,2.5) circle (0.325); (3.75,1.5)–(5.75,2.75); (3.75,1.5)–(5,3.5);&#10;&#10;at (4.8,4) [Coherent state ensemble]{}; at (4.2,3.25) [(i)]{};&#10;&#10;(3.5,1.5)–(5.75,1.5); (3.75,1.25)–(3.75,3.5);&#10;&#10;(4.75,2.5) circle (0.325); (4.25,2) circle (0.155);&#10;(3.75,1.5)–(5.75,2.75); (3.75,1.5)–(5,3.5); (4.75,2.5)–(4.25,2); at&#10;(4.8,4) [Loss in classical equations]{}; at (4.2,3.25) [(ii)]{};&#10;&#10;(8.25,1.5)–(10.5,1.5); (8.5,1.25)–(8.5,3.5);&#10;&#10;(9.5,2.5) circle (0.325); (9,2) circle (0.325); (8.5,1.5)–(10.5,2.75);&#10;(8.5,1.5)–(9.75,3.5); (9.5,2.5)–(9,2);&#10;&#10;at (9.75,4) [Addition of loss fluctuations]{}; at (8.95,3.25) [(iii)]{};&#10;&#10;The effect of adding fluctuations during propagation is visualized for&#10;the loss process in Fig. \[fig\_3\]: in diagram (i), a coherent state&#10;ensemble of Eq. is visualized in phase space and in (ii), the ensemble&#10;is attenuated (bluered) through the classical Eq. in the absence of FWM&#10;and Raman scattering. Loss is classically a linear and phase-insensitive&#10;process, so all elements of the ensemble are translated directly towards&#10;the origin of phase space; this process is unphysical because the&#10;coherent state is squeezed in all directions simultaneously, thus&#10;breaking the uncertainty principle. In diagram (iii), the effect of&#10;adding the loss fluctuation of Eqs. – is seen to maintain the shape of&#10;the coherent state. The addition of the fluctuation ensures at the same&#10;time automatically that a NF equal to the loss is induced as expected of&#10;a passive device.&#10;&#10;The ensemble approach described here has the advantage that it includes&#10;both amplitude and phase noise from SpRS in the FWM process. Raman&#10;amplifiers are usually described in power or photon number equations and&#10;the noise properties are derived from a statistical approach to the&#10;photon number mean and variance, which thus excludes phase noise.">

<outline text="Fiber attenuation" _note="In the context of realizing quantum state preserving frequency&#10;conversion, it is of interest to investigate how fiber loss affects the&#10;CE and NF of BS and how the loss fluctuations are coupled among the&#10;interacting waves in the FWM process, so we exclude Raman scattering and&#10;assume by one of the approaches discussed above.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig\_4\] shows the results of solving Eq. (and the three&#10;corresponding ones of –) through a fiber of length km and the addition&#10;of fluctuations during propagation with dB/km for all wave components,&#10;which implies that the results do not depend on which of the cases&#10;(a)–(d) is considered. The results depend only slightly on the values of&#10;and through the explicit frequency dependence on the right hand side of&#10;Eq. . This frequency dependence is so small in highly nonlinear fibers&#10;that it is usually neglected . The CE versus position in the fiber is&#10;plotted in Fig. \[fig\_4\](i) (blue dots) together with the analytic&#10;result of Eq. (solid black), where an excellent agreement is found. The&#10;red-dashed line compares the simulated CE to the approximation of Eq. ,&#10;which gives the same as if losses on the pumps are neglected entirely;&#10;for small the approximation is seen to be reasonable. The importance of&#10;the solid-red line, the loss factor, is seen in Fig. \[fig\_4\](ii) in&#10;which the loss-induced NF is plotted: the blue dots show the simulated&#10;NF versus position in the fiber where each local minimum corresponds to&#10;the maximum CE in Fig. \[fig\_4\](i). The solid-red line thus marks a&#10;loss-induced noise floor that equals and cannot be overcome. However,&#10;increasing the pump powers gives a shorter conversion distance since the&#10;conversion coefficient is , thus the accumulated signal and idler losses&#10;become smaller.&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;To investigate how the loss-induced noise couples between the signal,&#10;the idler, and the two pumps, we set the loss coefficient to zero at the&#10;different components in turn and repeat the simulation above (not shown&#10;graphically). If the losses of the signal and idler are excluded while&#10;keeping the losses of both pumps, the CE oscillates between 0 and 1 as&#10;if no loss was present, but the oscillation is still slowed by the loss&#10;in the pumps. The NF follows the CE, thus oscillating between infinity&#10;and 0. Hence, the loss-induced fluctuations in the pumps do not couple&#10;to the signal and idler. Turning on the loss in either of the signal or&#10;idler gives indistinguishable results, the characteristics of which are&#10;intermediate between turning the losses on or off in both. Consequently,&#10;the loss-induced fluctuations in the signal couple to the idler. If only&#10;the losses of the pumps are excluded, the slowing of the CE and NF&#10;oscillation disappears and the solution of Eq. is very accurate, but the&#10;NF observed in Fig. \[fig\_4\](ii) is not decreased, which confirms that&#10;no pump fluctuations were coupled to the signal and idler through FWM.">

<outline text="Stimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering" _note="FWM and Raman scattering have a complicated interplay because they&#10;depend differently on the frequency shifts and : FWM requires phase&#10;matching, while SRS, which is anti-symmetric around the pumps, has a&#10;complicated material response in the frequency domain. Furthermore, as&#10;shown in Sec. \[sec\_1\], SpRS is asymmetric around the pumps. To&#10;isolate the effects of SRS and SpRS in the FWM process, we disregard&#10;loss henceforth and assume again .&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig\_5\] shows the results of solving Eq. (and the three&#10;corresponding ones of –) through a fiber of length km and adding Raman&#10;fluctuations at K during propagation in cases (a) (top) and (b)&#10;(bottom); Fig. \[fig\_5\](i) shows the CE versus position in the fiber,&#10;and the simulated (dotted blue) and the analytic (solid black) results&#10;agree very well. After km the two curves start differing significantly&#10;because it was assumed in the analytic expression that the pumps do not&#10;exchange energy. The actual energy exchange between the pumps, which is&#10;caused by Raman scattering, taking place in the simulation has two&#10;impacts on the conversion efficiency due to SRS transferring energy to&#10;the lower frequency pump, which is p in these cases: firstly, the&#10;difference in pump power causes a phase mismatch cf. the definition of ;&#10;secondly, the conversion coefficient becomes smaller because the product&#10;of two functions that have a constant sum is largest when values of the&#10;functions are equal.&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;In case (a), where the signal and idler are on the S side of the pumps,&#10;the CE grows through the fiber, essentially due to Raman amplification.&#10;That is, a CE higher than unity means that the signal and idler have&#10;been amplified by SRS such that the output idler has a higher output&#10;power than the signal input. The red curve denotes the Raman&#10;amplification term. The NF oscillates in phase with the CE, but the&#10;lowest achievable point increases according to the S side Raman-induced&#10;NF (calculated in the Appendix), valid for case (a), where is the Raman&#10;gain. The dashed green line of Fig. \[fig\_5\](ii) (top plot) marks the&#10;Raman-induced NF at 0 K, so the region between that curve and the solid&#10;black curve is the NF induced by the existence of thermally excited&#10;phonons. In case (b), where the signal and idler are on the aS side of&#10;the pumps, the CE drops off exponentially because energy flows towards&#10;the pumps through SRS. The NF on the aS side is different from that on&#10;the S side for two reasons: firstly, since the aS process requires the&#10;presence of phonons, aS SpRS cannot occur at 0 K (as discussed above),&#10;and secondly, Raman depletion removes photons from a wave component so&#10;the SNR must change accordingly (much like the effect of losses). Hence,&#10;the aS Raman-induced NF (see the Appendix), valid for case (b), is where&#10;. The first term on the right hand side, the Raman depletion term, is in&#10;contrast to the first term in Eq. growing through the fiber. The dashed&#10;green line of Fig. \[fig\_5\](ii) (bottom plot) represents the minimum&#10;Raman NF of the aS side as caused by Raman depletion, and the region&#10;between that curve and the analytic curve is the entire SpRS&#10;contribution.&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;[0.49]{}&#10;&#10;Having established that Eq. is a good description of phase matched BS in&#10;the presence of Raman scattering and that the S and aS NFs of Eqs. and&#10;accurately predicts the NF of BS at the points of optimal conversion, we&#10;can use these analytic expressions to analyze the frequency and&#10;temperature dependencies of the BS CE and NF.

The CE is in both&#10;cases essentially showing the signal and idler average Raman&#10;amplification, case (a), and depletion, case (b), that they receive from&#10;the two pumps; for these realistic parameter values, stimulated Raman&#10;scattering is a significant effect (in both cases up to a factor ) that&#10;must be taken into account in silica fibers. Note that the frequency&#10;separation between the pump and the side band that are closest together&#10;is .&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig\_6\](iii) and (iv) show the NF of cases (a) and (b),&#10;respectively, i.e. Eqs. and versus and the temperature, ; the color&#10;scalings on the two plots are equal. For small -values THz, the two NFs&#10;are similar for all values of , which is expected from Fig. \[fig\_2\]&#10;since the magnitudes of the rates of SpRS on the S and aS sides are&#10;comparable close to the pump; the aS side SpRS contribution is smaller&#10;but Raman depletion also contribute to the aS NF. The NF-values at low&#10;temperatures for small (lower left corner) are in both cases&#10;approximately 0.4 dB; for small -values at room temperature (upper left&#10;corner) the NF is approximately 2.7 dB on the S side but 3.1 dB on the&#10;aS side. For larger -values (right side), the Raman depletion term&#10;becomes dominant on the aS side so the NF grows beyond 4 dB for all&#10;value of . On the S side, where the NF is not affected by any Raman&#10;depletion term, the NF increases with as expected from Fig. \[fig\_2\].&#10;Given these numbers, the S side seems advantageous with lower NF but an&#10;important note on the difference in origin between the S and aS NFs&#10;should be taken. The S NF is solely induced by SpRS, which increases the&#10;power variance of a signal ensemble due to the random phase of the&#10;spontaneous decay; the aS NF is composed of both SpRS and the effect of&#10;Raman depletion. The rate of SpRS is always smaller on the aS side&#10;compared to the S side so the power variance increases less there; in&#10;the total NF of 3.1 dB at 300 K in , SpRS is only responsible for 45% of&#10;the total NF in linear units. This number is found by calculating the&#10;ratio of the temperature dependent part of Eq. (the second term)&#10;relative to the total .&#10;&#10;At room temperature, the minimum achievable S and aS NFs are 2.1 dB and&#10;2.6 dB, respectively, which underlines that Raman scattering has a&#10;significant Bragg scattering in terms of both CE and NF. Specific,&#10;realistic parameters where chosen in all simulations conducted in this&#10;paper but it has been verified in subsequent simulations that the&#10;presented results do not change notably by changing the and the pump&#10;powers by an order of magnitude. Changing significantly leads to a&#10;different Raman interaction, especially between the pump and the side&#10;bands that are separated the most.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="We presented a model for calculating the quantum noise properties of&#10;parametric frequency conversion in form of Bragg Scattering; dispersion,&#10;loss, and stimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering were included.&#10;Closed-form analytic expressions for the conversion efficiency and Raman&#10;noise contribution were derived.&#10;&#10;It was shown that loss in the signal and idler reduces the conversion&#10;efficiency and induces a noise floor equal to the common loss factor,&#10;and that loss in the pumps reduces the rate at which the energy&#10;oscillates between the signal and idler. Further elaboration showed that&#10;the pump losses do not induce a noise figure in the signal and idler. On&#10;the other hand, loss in either of the signal and idler induces a noise&#10;figure in the other component.&#10;&#10;Both stimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering were shown to have&#10;significant impacts on parametric frequency conversion for a choice of&#10;realistic parameters for a highly nonlinear fiber: stimulated Raman&#10;scattering affects the conversion efficiency as would be expected from&#10;Raman amplifiers, the longer wavelength components receive energy from&#10;the shorter wavelength components. Spontaneous Raman scattering, which&#10;is asymmetric around the pumps, induces a minimum noise figure of 2.1 dB&#10;on the Stokes side of the pumps, case (a), for one full conversion from&#10;signal to idler at room temperature. On the anti-Stokes sides of the&#10;pumps, case (b), a minimum noise figure of dB caused by both spontaneous&#10;Raman scattering and Raman depletion is predicted. Lowering the&#10;temperature reduces SpRS on the Stokes side of the pumps but does not&#10;remove it; on the anti-Stokes side, SpRS is removed completely when&#10;lowering the temperature but the effect of Raman depletion is still&#10;present.&#10;&#10;Our theoretical predictions confirm that the presence of Raman&#10;scattering in silica fiber-based four-wave mixing in form of Bragg&#10;scattering contaminates the quantum noise-less frequency conversion to a&#10;significant degree that is comparable to the 3-dB noise figure induced&#10;by linear amplifiers such as phase-insensitive parametric amplifiers,&#10;Raman and Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers.">

<outline text="Appendix: Variance of the Raman fluctuations and the Raman noise figure" _note="Given an ensemble of electromagnetic fields defined as in Eq. , we may&#10;apply a constant Raman gain in power from one pump to one signal, which&#10;leaves the SNR unchanged (signal and noise are amplified equally). The&#10;pump also provide spontaneous emission at the frequency of the signal&#10;ensemble, and this contribution changes the SNR. In this semi-classical&#10;model, we add fluctuation variables after having applied the gain and&#10;then calculate the corresponding change in the SNR. The output field&#10;ensemble of a Raman amplifier in the linear gain regime is where is the&#10;fluctuation in quadrature of the spontaneous emission associated with&#10;the physical process that provided the gain. Defining the SNR as Eq. and&#10;the Raman NF as the ratio , we get where a large photon number was&#10;assumed and it was furthermore assumed that the statistics of the&#10;fluctuations in both quadratures are equal, so . To evaluate the NF the&#10;variance of , which is equal to the second order moment because has zero&#10;mean value, must be determined.&#10;&#10;Classical photon-number equations describing the Raman interaction&#10;between two waves at different wavelengths are shown in textbooks on&#10;nonlinear optics and it is custom to approximate the shorter wavelength&#10;component (the anti-Stokes component or pump in the context of Raman&#10;amplifiers) by a constant but here we also need to consider the opposite&#10;case of the longer wavelength component (the Stokes component) being&#10;much stronger than the shorter wavelength component and hence&#10;approximate that by a constant. Likewise, the mean output power&#10;associated with Eq. is where Eq. describes the weak Stokes component&#10;that receives Raman gain from the strong anti-Stokes component, and Eq.&#10;describes the distinct case of the weak anti-Stokes component that&#10;depletes by a factor by giving energy to the strong Stokes component.&#10;The second term of each equation is the amplification/depletion of the&#10;vacuum fluctuations explicitly included in Eq. and they are artifacts of&#10;the semi-classical modeling; and should be chosen to counter-balance&#10;these terms as well to include spontaneous emission. If and are chosen&#10;to be and they are inserted into Eqs. and , then one gets the equivalent&#10;of what may be derived from the classical equations. The Raman NF of a&#10;signal on either side of a strong pump is thus easily calculated using&#10;Eq. to be The arrows indicate the limits in case of large Raman&#10;interaction, i.e. and . In the limit of low temperature, , these&#10;formulas give the expected results of a 3-dB NF on the S side and a NF&#10;equal to the depletion on the aS side.&#10;&#10;Considering case (a) and case (b) of Fig. \[fig\_1\], in which there are&#10;two pumps and two small signals, the results Eqs. – do not immediately&#10;apply. However, if one regards the two pumps as one wave component with&#10;power and the signal and idler as one small signal, one has an&#10;artificial two-component system that may be described by the results of&#10;this appendix. The frequency separation between the two components is in&#10;case (a) and in case (b).">
