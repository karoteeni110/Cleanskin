    <abstract>According to generalized Mellin derivative , we introduce a new family
of polynomials called higher order generalized geometric polynomials. We
obtain some properties of them.We discuss their connections to
degenerate Bernoulli and Euler polynomials. Furthermore, we find new
formulas for the Carlitz’s and Howard’s finite sums. Finally, we
evaluate several series in closed forms, one of which has the
coefficients include values of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, we
calculate some integrals in terms of generalized geometric polynomials.

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The operator , called Mellin derivative , has a long mathematical&#10;history. As far back as 1740, Euler used the operator as a tool work in&#10;his work . The Mellin derivative and its generalizations are used to&#10;obtain a new class of polynomials , to evaluate some power series in&#10;closed forms and to calculate some integrals . One of the&#10;generalizations of Mellin derivative is where is any -times&#10;differentiable function and are generalized Stirling number pair with&#10;three free parameters (see Section 2). Stirling numbers and their&#10;generalizations have many interesting combinatorial interpretations.&#10;Besides, these numbers are connected with some well known special&#10;polynomials and numbers . For example, the following interesting&#10;formulas for Bernoulli numbers and Euler polynomials appear in : For all&#10;;&#10;&#10;From all these motivations, by using the generalized of Mellin&#10;derivative in (\[1\]), we introduce a new family of polynomials , called&#10;higher order generalized geometric polynomials, evaluate some power&#10;series in closed forms and calculate some integrals. After that, in view&#10;of the properties of higher order generalized geometric polynomials, we&#10;derive new explicit formulas for degenerate Bernoulli polynomials,&#10;Bernoulli polynomials and degenerate Euler polynomials. As a&#10;consequences of these formulas we evaluate Carlitz’s and Howard’s sums.&#10;&#10;The summary by sections is as follows: Section 2 is the preliminary&#10;section where we give definitions and known results needed. In Section&#10;3, we define higher order generalized geometric polynomials and obtain&#10;some properties such as recurrence relation and generating function of&#10;Moreover, we derive new explicit formulas for degenerate Bernoulli&#10;polynomials, Bernoulli polynomials and degenerate Euler polynomials. By&#10;the help of these formulas we find new formulas for Carlit’s and&#10;Howard’s sums. In final section, we obtain some integral representation&#10;of . Besides, we evaluate several power series in closed forms. For&#10;example, in the special cases, the following series, where the&#10;coefficients include values of the Riemann zeta function, is evaluated&#10;in closed form (for any integer )&#10;&#10;Throughout this paper we assume that and are real or complex numbers.">
