  <outline text="The quantum dot sample" _note="We study in this work single self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs)&#10;embedded in a GaAs heterostructure, a diode grown by molecular beam&#10;epitaxy. The diode is formed by an n-i-p structure ,&#10;Fig. \[fig:sfig1\](a), where the top- and back-gates are epitaxial&#10;layers of GaAs doped with carbon and silicon, respectively. The n-i-p&#10;diode includes also a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) which increases&#10;the photon collection efficiency. The complete layer sequence is given&#10;in Tab. \[tab:nip\].&#10;&#10;The main advantage of the n-i-p diode over an n-i-Schottky diode is an&#10;enhanced photon collection by roughly one order of magnitude. On the one&#10;hand, this is achieved by the DBR which reflects downward emitted&#10;photons towards the objective. On the other hand, the absorption of&#10;photons in the top-gate is reduced by using an epitaxial gate instead of&#10;a metal gate.&#10;&#10;The final layer of undoped GaAs places the p-doped layer, the top-gate,&#10;around a node-position of the standing electromagnetic wave in the n-i-p&#10;diode. The n- and p-doped layers are contacted independently. Selective&#10;etching of the capping allows the buried p-layer to be contacted. Access&#10;to the n-layer is ensured by wet etching a mesa structure.&#10;&#10;To increase the collection efficiency further we placed a zirconia (ZrO)&#10;hemispherical solid-immersion lens (SIL) on the semiconductor surface.&#10;The SIL has a refractive index of at .&#10;&#10;In the experiment the n-contact is grounded and a gate voltage is&#10;applied to the p-contact. The gate voltage allows control over the&#10;charge: single electrons can be loaded into the QD; furthermore,&#10;excitonic resonances can be shifted by the DC Stark effect .&#10;Fig. \[fig:sfig1\](b) shows the photoluminescence from a single QD&#10;following non-resonant excitation at (excitation into the wetting&#10;layer). Several charging plateaus are clearly visible in the&#10;photoluminescence. They correspond to optical transitions from an&#10;excited state to a ground state with different charge: , , and , with&#10;and representing a single hole and single electron, respectively. The DC&#10;Stark shift is from red to blue with increasing and can be seen clearly.&#10;We note that the X plateau overlaps with the X plateau only with&#10;non-resonant excitation. We attribute this overlap to the occasional&#10;decay of the via an Auger process .">

  <outline text="Resonance fluorescence with continuous wave excitation" _note="In resonance fluorescence spectroscopy we investigate the QD&#10;characteristics with a narrow band (linewidth in sub range) excitation&#10;laser. The scattering induced by resonant excitation is detected.&#10;Back-reflected laser light is suppressed with a dark-field technique&#10;leading to an extinction of :1 . A typical spectrum from the QD at low&#10;excitation power is depicted in Fig. \[fig:sfig1\](c). The linewidth,&#10;measured here slowly, is around well below saturation, approximately 2.5&#10;times larger than the transform limit . A signal to background ratio of&#10;more than 1,000: is achieved with linearly polarized excitation. With&#10;increasing excitation power the linewidth broadens (power broadening)&#10;and the resonance fluorescence signal increases reaching a saturation&#10;count-rate of (), Fig. \[fig:sfig1\](d). This signal is about 10 times&#10;more than from QDs in typical n-i-Schottky samples . The signal is&#10;measured with a single photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) with an&#10;efficiency of 20% at these wavelengths. Throughout, the stated&#10;count-rates are the bare count rates and are not corrected for instance&#10;for the poor SPAD quantum efficiency. The photon extraction efficiency&#10;from single QDs in the n-i-p device is around 10%, a success resulting&#10;from several improvements in the sample design as discussed above: the&#10;n-i-p type features a DBR and a transparent epitaxial gate.">

  <outline text="Resonance fluorescence with pulsed excitation" _note="With pulsed excitation, we use the full spectrum of transform-limited&#10;“ultra-fast&quot; pulses, again exciting the QD resonantly. The spectral&#10;full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the pulse is . With this bandwidth&#10;we address the ground state transition for the particular charge state&#10;set by the gate voltage (but not higher energy transitions). The&#10;resonance fluorescence of the QD is detected with a grating&#10;spectrometer.&#10;&#10;A scheme of the complete set-up is shown in Fig. \[fig:sfig2\]. The&#10;ultra-fast pulses from a mode-locked femtosecond laser are expanded and&#10;sent into a compact pulse-shaper. The pulse-shaper retains all the&#10;spectral components and controls the amount of chirp as described below.&#10;From here the pulses pass through power control and polarization optics&#10;and are then coupled into a single mode optical fiber. The fiber&#10;transports the pulses to a confocal microscope. In the microscope, the&#10;excitation pulses pass through a linear polarizer, two beam-splitters&#10;and are sent to the objective at cryogenic temperature (4.2 K). The&#10;objective, an aspherical lens with a numerical aperture of 0.68, focuses&#10;the light onto the sample. The sample is held on a stack of&#10;piezo-steppers which allows a particular QD to be placed within the&#10;focal spot of the microscope. This process is aided by the in situ&#10;diagnostics provided by a camera image of the focus. Light scattered by&#10;the QD is collected and coupled into the detection fiber. The&#10;back-reflected laser light is suppressed by a second linear polarizer&#10;whose axis is orthogonal to the axis of the polarizer in the excitation&#10;stage. The resonance fluorescence signal is detected directly with a&#10;SPAD (continuous wave excitation) or with a spectrometer-CCD camera&#10;(pulsed excitation).&#10;&#10;Detecting resonance fluorescence with pulsed excitation also depends on&#10;suppressing the reflected laser light with the polarization-based&#10;dark-field technique. However, owing to the wavelength dependence of the&#10;polarization optics, the laser suppression of a broadband pulsed laser&#10;is less effective than with the narrowband continuous wave laser: we&#10;reach an extinction ratio of typically :1 with broadband excitation. We&#10;use in addition the spectral mismatch between the broadband laser and&#10;the narrowband resonance fluorescence to increase the extinction ratio,&#10;Fig. \[fig:sfig3\]. The laser background falling on the CCD camera does&#10;not depend on the gate voltage, Fig. \[fig:sfig3\](a), such that we can&#10;use the gate voltage dependence of the QD emission to construct the&#10;laser background spectrum. The resulting residual laser background is&#10;shown in Fig. \[fig:sfig3\](b) in red. The spectral shape is explained&#10;by the Gaussian spectral shape of the excitation laser along with the&#10;quadratic function of laser suppression: the laser suppression is most&#10;effective at its alignment wavelength and then decays quadratically in&#10;wavelength superimposed by interference fringes. A typical spectrum&#10;measured at is shown in black. Sharp emission peaks from the exciton and&#10;biexciton appear on top of the laser background. The signal after&#10;background subtraction is shown in the lower plot in blue. Before&#10;background subtraction, the maximum signal to background ratio in a&#10;narrow spectral window around the emission line is 22:1.&#10;&#10;The measurement of emission linewidths in resonance fluorescence with&#10;broadband excitation is limited by the resolution of the spectrometer.&#10;Hence, we can only state that these linewidths are below , as depicted&#10;in the spectrum in Fig. 1 of the main paper.">

  <outline text="Pulse shaping: introducing chirp" _note="Chirp is introduced into the transform-limited laser pulses by a&#10;compact, folded pulse-shaper . The scheme is depicted in Fig. 1 of the&#10;main paper. The unchirped pulse is diffracted by a high resolution,&#10;blazed grating (1,800 grooves per mm) and then focused by a lens onto a&#10;mirror positioned in the focal plane. From here the light travels back&#10;under a small angle with respect to the diffraction plane allowing a&#10;spatial separation of incoming and outgoing pulses. The distance between&#10;grating and lens controls the chirp . The lens and the mirror are&#10;mounted on a translation platform. Moving the platform with respect to&#10;the grating changes the chirp: if the distance matches the focal length&#10;of the lens the chirp is zero, a larger (smaller) distance leads to&#10;negative (positive) chirp. The temporal duration of the pulses exiting&#10;the laser is (intensity FWHM); the temporal duration can be stretched up&#10;to corresponding to a chirp in the range from to .&#10;&#10;We characterized the chirp with a combination of a FROG and&#10;autocorrelator. This allows us to reveal the presence of any high-order&#10;phase terms and prevent them by an optimal adjustment of the&#10;pulse-shaper. The chirp is measured both in the free space mode and also&#10;after the optical single mode fiber in order to determine the sign of&#10;the chirp and to compensate for the chirp introduced by the fiber&#10;itself.">

<outline text="Theoretical Model" _note="For the theoretical calculations we use the standard model of a&#10;two-level system coupled to longitudinal phonons. For clarity, we&#10;outline here the details of the model.">
  <outline text="Hamiltonian" _note="We can divide the Hamiltonian of the system into four parts with where&#10;denotes the electronic structure, describes the carrier-light coupling&#10;and the phonon part.&#10;&#10;For the electronic structure we take a two-level system, which consists&#10;of the ground state and the single exciton state with the Hamiltonian&#10;where denotes the energy of the negative trion. The energy of the ground&#10;state has been set to zero.&#10;&#10;The carrier-light interaction is modeled in the usual dipole and&#10;rotating wave approximation. For this two-level system we have where ,&#10;with the positive frequency component of the electric field of the laser&#10;pulse; denotes the dipole matrix element.&#10;&#10;The main source of decoherence in QDs is caused by the coupling to&#10;longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons which are treated as bulk-like due to&#10;the small acoustic mismatch between the QD area and the surrounding&#10;material . The Hamiltonian of the free phonons reads where () is the&#10;creation (annihilation) operator of a phonon with wave vector and&#10;frequency , being the sound velocity.&#10;&#10;The carrier-phonon interaction is modeled by a pure-dephasing&#10;Hamiltonian using the deformation potential coupling mechanism. The&#10;corresponding Hamiltonian is given by The main coupling mechanism is the&#10;deformation potential coupling with the coupling matrix element for the&#10;electrons and holes where is the normalization volume, the mass density&#10;of the crystal, and the deformation potential coupling constant for&#10;electrons/holes. As parameters we take the standard GaAs parameter&#10;listed in Tab. \[tab:para\]. The exciton coupling matrix element is&#10;obtained by .&#10;&#10;The form factor accounts for the bound states of the QD and, thus, for&#10;the geometry of the QD. We assume a harmonic confinement potential in a&#10;lens-shaped QD yielding the form factor is the wave vector in the&#10;-direction; is the in-plane wave vector. and are the electron/hole&#10;localization lengths in the -direction and in the -plane direction,&#10;respectively. We used  nm and  nm, thereby modelling a flat QD. The&#10;ratio between electron and hole localization lengths is taken to be for&#10;both directions .&#10;&#10;Before the laser pulse, we assume that the electronic system is in the&#10;ground state and the phonon system is in a thermal equilibrium given by&#10;a Bose distribution at temperature with with the Boltzmann constant. If&#10;not denoted otherwise, we use liquid helium temperature at . Assuming an&#10;initially uncorrelated state, we can take the product state between&#10;carrier and phonon system as initial condition for the dynamics.&#10;&#10;Using this Hamiltonian we set up the equations of motion in the density&#10;matrix formalism which leads to an infinite hierarchy of phonon-assisted&#10;variables. We truncate this hierarchy using a fourth-order correlation&#10;expansion, which yields reliable results for the carrier-dynamics in a&#10;QD . The equations of motion of the two-level model can be found, e.g.,&#10;in Ref. .&#10;&#10;[14]{}ifxundefined \[1\][ ifx[\#1]{} ]{}ifnum \[1\][ \#1firstoftwo&#10;secondoftwo ]{}ifx \[1\][ \#1firstoftwo secondoftwo ]{}““\#1””@noop&#10;\[0\][secondoftwo]{}sanitize@url \[0\][‘\&#10;12‘\$12&#10;‘&amp;12‘\#12‘12‘\_12‘%12]{}@startlink\[1\]@endlink\[0\]@bib@innerbibempty&#10;[****,  ()](\doibase&#10;  10.1038/nmat4704) [****,  ()](\doibase 10.1038/35016030) [****, &#10;()](\doibase 10.1103/PhysRevB.77.245311) [****,&#10;()](\doibase 10.1038/nmat3585) [****,  ()](\doibase&#10;  10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01082) [****,  ()](\doibase 10.1038/nphys2688)&#10;[****,  ()](\doibase 10.1063/1.4813879) [****, &#10;()](\doibase 10.1109/JQE.1987.1073201) [****, &#10;()](\doibase 10.1109/3.135209) [****,&#10;()](\doibase 10.1088/0953-8984/26/42/423203) @noop [****,  ()]{} [****, &#10;()](\doibase 10.1103/PhysRevB.85.121302) [****,  ()](\doibase&#10;  10.1103/PhysRevB.84.195311) [****, &#10;()](\doibase 10.1103/PhysRevB.73.035302)">
