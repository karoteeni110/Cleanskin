    <title>Cofree coalgebras and differential linear logic</title>
    <abstract>We prove that the semantics of intuitionistic linear logic in vector
spaces which uses cofree coalgebras to model the exponential is a model
of differential linear logic. Thus, in this semantics, proof denotations
have natural derivatives. We give several examples of these derivatives. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The idea of taking derivatives of programs is an old one with many&#10;manifestations, including automatic differentiation of algorithms&#10;computing real-valued functions and incremental computation . However,&#10;these approaches are limited to restricted classes of computations, and&#10;it is only recently with the development of the differential -calculus&#10;by Ehrhard-Regnier and its refinement differential linear logic that&#10;derivatives have been defined for general higher-order programs. As with&#10;ordinary calculus, the aim of these theories is to assign to a program&#10;another program (the derivative) which computes the change in the output&#10;of resulting from an infinitesimal change to its input. Here we give&#10;ourselves arbitrary -linear combinations of programs (meaning -terms or&#10;proofs in linear logic) as a starting point so that “small” changes to&#10;the input make sense.&#10;&#10;This paper is about the semantics of differential linear logic,&#10;following . The aim is to explain how the natural semantics of&#10;intuitionistic linear logic in vector spaces is already a model of&#10;differential linear logic. The key point is that tangent vectors and&#10;derivatives appear as soon as we introduce cofree coalgebras to model&#10;the exponential, which shows that the differential structure is&#10;intrinsic to the algebra of linear logic.&#10;&#10;To see this, let denote semantics in vector spaces and suppose we are&#10;given a proof in linear logic computing a function from inputs of type&#10;to outputs of type : The space of inputs to is , and a small change in&#10;the input starting from is a tangent vector at , viewing as a smooth&#10;manifold or a scheme. This is equivalent to the data of a linear map&#10;@C+2pc[ (\[\]/\^2)\^\* &amp; [A ]{} ]{} where is the ring of dual numbers&#10;(this bijection is reviewed in Appendix \[section:tangent\_vectors\]).&#10;If is the universal cocommutative counital coalgebra mapping to then&#10;there is a unique lifting of this linear map to a morphism of coalgebras&#10;\[eq:toucan\] @C+2pc[ (\[\]/\^2)\^\* &amp; [ A ]{}. ]{} Similarly the linear&#10;map lifts to a morphism of coalgebras which may be composed with to give&#10;a morphism of coalgebras \[eq:toucan2\] @C+2pc[ (\[\]/\^2)\^\* &amp; [ A ]{}&#10;&amp; [ B ]{} ]{} which, in turn, defines a tangent vector at the point ,&#10;where is the point of corresponding to . The tangent vector gives the&#10;infinitesimal variation of the output of on the input , when the input&#10;is varied in the direction of .&#10;&#10;The formal statement is that for any algebraically closed field of&#10;characteristic zero the semantics of intuitionistic linear logic in&#10;-vector spaces defined using cofree coalgebras is model of differential&#10;linear logic (Theorem \[main\_theorem\]). We refer to this as the&#10;SWEEDLER SEMANTICS, since the explicit description of this universal&#10;coalgebra is due to him . The proof is elementary and we make no claim&#10;here to technical novelty; the link between the symmetric coalgebra and&#10;differential calculus is well-known. Perhaps our main contribution is to&#10;give several detailed examples showing how to compute these derivatives.&#10;We do this with the aim of reinforcing the fact that differentiating&#10;programs, even higher-order ones, is a natural thing to do.\&#10;We conclude this introduction with a sketch of one such example and a&#10;comparison of our work to other semantics of differential linear logic.&#10;To elaborate a little more on the notation: for any type of linear logic&#10;(which for us has only connectives ) there is a vector space , and for&#10;any proof of there is a linear map . In particular every proof of type&#10;has a denotation , and the promotion of has for its denotation a vector&#10;, see .&#10;&#10;For any binary sequence there is an encoding of as a proof of type&#10;Repetition of sequences can be encoded as a proof The denotation is a&#10;linear map sending to . The derivative of according to the theory of&#10;differential linear logic is another a proof which can be derived from&#10;by new deduction rules called codereliction, cocontraction and&#10;coweakening (see Section \[section:coder\]). We prove in Section&#10;\[section:bint\] that the denotation of this derivative in the Sweedler&#10;semantics is the linear map whose value on the tensor we interpret as&#10;the derivative of the repeat program at the sequence in the direction of&#10;the sequence . This can be justified informally by the following&#10;calculation using an infinitesimal which says that varying the sequence&#10;infinitesimally from in the direction of causes a variation of the&#10;repetition in the direction of .\&#10;The Sweedler semantics is far from the first semantics of differential&#10;linear logic: basic examples include the categories of sets and&#10;relations and suplattices . The motivating examples using topological&#10;spaces and differentiable functions are the Köthe and finiteness space&#10;semantics of Ehrhard and the semantics of Blute-Ehrhard-Tasson based on&#10;the theory of convenient vector spaces . These papers explain that the&#10;geometric “avatar” of the exponential connective of linear logic is the&#10;functor sending a space to the space of distributions on (for a precise&#10;statement, see Remark \[remark:distr\]). This remarkable analogy between&#10;logic and geometry deserves further study. One obstacle is that it seems&#10;difficult to compute examples of denotations and their derivatives in&#10;the convenient vector space setting of . For example the coproduct is&#10;defined by extension to a Mackey closure, and is rather implicit.&#10;&#10;Conceptually the Sweedler semantics is similar to these examples in that&#10;the exponential is modelled by a space of distributions (with finite&#10;support) but it is purely algebraic and there are simple explicit&#10;formulas for all the structure maps. Moreover in the algebraic approach&#10;the differential structure emerges naturally from the exponential&#10;structure, rather than being “baked in”. The downside is that the&#10;smoothness of proof denotations in our semantics is obscured; in&#10;particular, in the case some extra work is required to see the relation&#10;between our differential structure and the derivatives in the usual&#10;sense.\&#10;For background material on linear logic and its semantics see . The&#10;formal theory of coalgebras is simpler over algebraically closed fields,&#10;which explains why we use in our examples, but this is not really&#10;important: one could work over by taking -points into account in the&#10;explicit description of the cofree coalgebra.\&#10;ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

Clearly the rules specify how to commute past the structural maps&#10;. Here stands for the dereliction rule in linear logic, for contraction&#10;and for weakening.

This has the advantage of providing an appealing&#10;symmetry to the formulation of the syntax. In this section we briefly&#10;sketch the definition of these maps in the Sweedler semantics.&#10;Throughout linear logic means intuitionistic linear logic with the&#10;connectives .&#10;&#10;First we recall the canonical commutative Hopf structure on of .

By these maps make into a&#10;commutative (and cocommutative) Hopf algebra. In the terminology of the&#10;map is the COCONTRACTION map and is the COWEAKENING map (the antipode&#10;seems not to have a formal role in differential linear logic).
