    <title>Fine structure of the diffraction cone: manifestation of -channel
unitarity</title>
    <abstract>We show that the deviation from exponential behavior of the diffraction
cone observed near GeV both at the ISR and the LHC (so-called break)
follows from a two-pion loop in the -channel, imposed by unitarity. By
using a simple Regge-pole model we extrapolate the “break” from the ISR
energy region to that of the LHC. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Following TOTEM’s impressive results on the low- measurements of the&#10;differential cross section at TeV, and anticipating their new&#10;measurements at TeV announced recently we find it appropriate to remind&#10;of the physics behind the observed departure from the exponential&#10;behavior of the forward diffraction cone.&#10;&#10;For the first time this phenomenon was observed in 1972 at the the CERN&#10;ISR , a deflection from the exponential behavior of the forward cone in&#10;proton-proton scattering around GeV, detected at several energies.&#10;&#10;Experimentalists quantify the departure from the linear exponential by&#10;replacing with coefficients fitted to the data.&#10;&#10;This effect can be well fitted also by a relevant form factor (residue&#10;function) in the Regge-pole scattering amplitude. For a complete and&#10;up-to-date review see .&#10;&#10;Soon after the ISR measurements, the phenomenon was interpreted as&#10;manifestation of -channel unitarity, producing a two-pion loop, as shown&#10;in Fig. \[Fig:Diagram\], and resulting in a relevant threshold&#10;singularity in the Pomeron trajectory. This effect, for bravity called&#10;the “break”, was confirmed by recent measurements by the TOTEM&#10;Collaboration at the CERN LHC, first at TeV and subsequently at TeV .&#10;&#10;The new LHC data from TOTEM at TeV confirm the conclusions made about&#10;the nature of the break and call for a more detailed analysis of the&#10;phenomenon. The new data triggered further theoretical work in this&#10;direction , but many issues still remain open. Although the curvature,&#10;both at the ISR and the LHC is concave, convex cannot be excluded in&#10;other reactions and/or new energies. While the departure from a linear&#10;exponential was studied in details both at the ISR and LHC energies, an&#10;extra(inter)polation between the two is necessary to clarify the&#10;uniqueness of the phenomenon. This is a challenge for the theory, and it&#10;can be done within Regge-pole models. Below we do so by using a very&#10;simple one, with two Regge exchanges, a Pomeron and a secondary&#10;effective Reggeon. To test its viability, we first fit its parameters to&#10;the proton-proton total section data (Sec. \[Sec:Model\]).&#10;&#10;The basic premise behind our approach is the introduction of a two-pion&#10;loop contribution in the -channel through Regge trajectories, that are&#10;non-linear complex functions. As shown by Barut and Zwanziger , -channel&#10;unitarity constrains the Regge trajectories near the -channel threshold,&#10;by where is the lightest threshold, in the case of the vacuum quantum&#10;numbers (Pomeron or meson). Since is small, a square-root threshold is a&#10;reasonable approximation to the above constrain. Higher threshold,&#10;inevitable in the trajectory, may be approximated by their power&#10;expansion, [I.E.]{} by a linear term, as in Eqs. (\[Eq:trajectory\]).&#10;This point is closely related also to the choice of the relevant&#10;interval in under study. Note that the threshold singularity is at&#10;positive , while the “break” is observed at negative , “symmetric” to .&#10;This reflection is a property of analytic functions. The concave&#10;departure from the linear exponential, observed in the interval GeV can&#10;be fitted by a single square-root threshold in the trajectory, but it&#10;would not reproduce the subsequent ( GeV) linearity of the exponential&#10;cone, persistent up to the dip (at GeV at the ISR or GeV at the LHC).&#10;Note also that we treat only the strong (nuclear) amplitude, separated&#10;from Coulombic forces. Thus, the “break” (in fact a smooth deflection of&#10;the linear exponential) of the cone, has a relatively narrow location&#10;around GeV both at the ISR and the LHC energies, whereupon it recovers&#10;its exponential shape, followed by the dip, whose position is strongly&#10;energy-dependent.&#10;&#10;In the present paper we study the “break” within a simple Regge-pole&#10;model, assuming the universality of this phenomenon in high-energy&#10;hadron scattering. On fitting the model to the data, we proceed in two&#10;ways: 1) trying to minimize the number of free parameters, we adopt&#10;standard values for the trajectories, [E.G.]{} from Ref. ; 2) on the&#10;other hand, in view of the oversimplified nature of our “effective”&#10;Regge-pole model, we optionally let these parameters free, fitting them&#10;to the data.&#10;&#10;In Sec. \[Sec:Model\] we introduce a simple Regge-pole model,&#10;normalizing its energy dependence to total cross section data. In&#10;\[Sec:ISR\] we revise the 1972 ISR data and their fits to a Regge-pole&#10;model with a -channel threshold imposed by unitarity. In Sec.&#10;\[Sec:LHC\] a similar analyses of the LHC data is presented. Central is&#10;Sec. \[Extrapolate\], in which, by Regge-extrapolating the cross section&#10;from the ISR energy region to that of the ISR, we map the “break” fitted&#10;at the ISR to that seen at the LHC. Some conclusions are drawn in Sec.&#10;\[Sec:Conclude\].">

<outline text="A simple Regge-pole model" _note="For our purposes we use a simple Regge pole model with a supercritical&#10;Pomeron and an effective Reggeon contributions, denoted by , close (but&#10;not similar) to the Reggeon, where with the trajectories We use the&#10;norm: The model contains 12 free parameters ( (), (dimensionless),&#10;(dimensionless), (GeV), (GeV), (GeV), (), (dimensionless),&#10;(dimensionless), (GeV), (GeV), (GeV)), most of which are known a priori,&#10;needing only fine-tuning.

From&#10;this fit we find the parameters and , to be fine-tuned in what follows.&#10;We found by trial that the scaling parameters do not affect&#10;significantly the resulting fits, so we set (GeV) everywhere, both for&#10;the Pomeron and for the .&#10;&#10;The resulting fit is shown in Fig. \[Fig:Total1\].&#10;&#10;The fit gives , , , , thus the total cross section is determined by the&#10;expression: .&#10;&#10;If we do not fix the values of and we obtain a slightly different fit&#10;for the total cross section of pp scattering shown in Fig.&#10;\[Fig:Total2\].

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="The successful fit to the proton-proton total cross section with a&#10;simple model, Figs. \[Fig:Total1\] and \[Fig:Total2\] shows the&#10;efficiency of Regge poles in reproducing energy dependence. Much more&#10;complicated is the parametrization of the -dependence, containing&#10;irregularities, in particular the “break” under discussion. Still, most&#10;of the fits presented in this paper are coherent and differ only by&#10;small details. To make the picture complete, we have quoted several&#10;options; one can see that the results are not too sensitive to the&#10;choice of the number of free parameters. For a better comparison between&#10;the “break” as seen at ISR and that at the LHC, we have refitted the ISR&#10;data, normalizing to an exponential “test function” (Figs.&#10;\[Fig:ISR\_norma\] and \[Fig:ISR\_normb\]) as done at the LHC . The&#10;resulting predictions, Fig. \[Fig:Predict\] for the LHC energy TeV may&#10;be of interest for experimentalists.&#10;&#10;We have shown that the deviation from a linear exponential of the&#10;diffraction cone as seen at the ISR, GeV and at the LHC, and TeV are of&#10;similar nature: they appear nearly at the same value of GeV, have the&#10;same concave shape of comparable “size”, GeV and may be fitted by&#10;similar -dependent function. Mapping this -dependence through the&#10;tremendous energy span from the ISR to the LHC (almost 3 orders of&#10;magnitude) is a highly non-trivial task. We have done it within the&#10;simplest Regge pole model, with two trajectories: a leading one, the&#10;Pomeron and a sub-leading effective Reggeon. More advanced and refined&#10;Regge-type models may improve the fit and clarify details.&#10;&#10;The threshold singularity in question should be present also in the&#10;trajectory, however it has secondary effect with respect to the Pomeron.&#10;&#10;Note also that the low- structure of the diffraction cone was fitted&#10;also by a relevant form factor (Regge residue).&#10;&#10;The results presented in this paper leave open and raise also several&#10;questions, namely:&#10;&#10;1\) theoretical calculations of the relative weight of the loop&#10;contribution, second term in Fig. \[Fig:Diagram\] relative to the first&#10;one (“Born term”) are needed;&#10;&#10;2\) why is the “break” observed only in elastic scattering, not in for&#10;example at the Tevatron? Once the Pomeron is universal, the effect&#10;should be present also in . Non-observation of any convex or concave&#10;curvature in the diffraction cone at the Tevatron may be attributed to&#10;poor statistics of the relevant data (lacking Roman pots), preventing&#10;the observation of such a tiny effect.&#10;&#10;To conclude, we expect more precise data in the low- region on elastic&#10;scattering and diffraction dissociation as well as further fits with&#10;improved phenomenological parametrizations. Theoretical calculations of&#10;the diagram (Fig. \[Fig:Diagram\]) may shed more light on the nature of&#10;the phenomenon. Needless to say, further attempts in this direction will&#10;be based on improved models for the scattering amplitude, with more&#10;details on individual Regge trajectories, including the Odderon.">
