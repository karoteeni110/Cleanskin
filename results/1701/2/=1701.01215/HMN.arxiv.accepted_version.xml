<outline text="Introduction" _note="In this paper we consider the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations&#10;for viscous incompressible flows around a rotating obstacle in&#10;two-dimensions: Here and are respectively unknown velocity field and&#10;pressure field, and is a given external force. The time dependent domain&#10;is defined as where is an exterior domain in with a smooth compact&#10;boundary, while the real number represents the rotation speed of the&#10;obstacle . We use the standard notation for derivatives: , , , , . The&#10;vector denotes the perpendicular: . The system describes the flow around&#10;the obstacle which rotates with a constant angular velocity , and the&#10;condition on the boundary represents the no-slip boundary condition. To&#10;remove the difficulty due to the time dependence of the fluid domain it&#10;is more convenient to analyze the system in the reference frame: for and&#10;, Here denotes the transpose of a matrix . Then is equivalent with the&#10;equations in the time-independent domain : In this paper we are&#10;interested in the stationary solutions to this system. Thus we assume&#10;that is independent of and consider the next system To state our result&#10;let us introduce the function spaces used in this paper. As usual, the&#10;class is defined as the set of smooth divergence free vector fields with&#10;compact support in , and the homogeneous space is the closure of with&#10;respect to the norm . For a fixed number we also introduce the weighted&#10;space and its subspace as follows. These are Banach spaces equipped with&#10;the natural norm and the set of functions with compact support is dense&#10;in . Moreover, for any bounded sequence in (or ) with for some , there&#10;exists a subsequence which converges in the weak-star topology in the&#10;sense that there is (or , respectively) such that and . We denote by the&#10;set of functions which belong to for any compact set , and , , is&#10;defined in the similar manner.&#10;&#10;The main result of this paper is stated as follows.&#10;&#10;\[thm.main\] There exists such that the following statement holds.&#10;Assume that is of the form with some and . If and then there exists a&#10;solution to , which is unique in a suitable class of functions (see&#10;Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] for the precise description). If in addition,&#10;then the solution behaves as where Here , , denotes the Cauchy stress&#10;tensor, and is the outward unit normal vector to .&#10;&#10;\(i) The smallness condition on and in can be slightly weakened with&#10;respect to the dependence on ; see Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] for&#10;details.&#10;&#10;\(ii) Both conditions and are critical in view of scaling. Note that the&#10;summability is needed only for the antisymmetric part of . These&#10;conditions are not enough to ensure that behaves like the circular flow&#10;as , and the additional decay condition as in Theorem \[thm.main\] is&#10;required to achieve this asymptotic property.&#10;&#10;\(iii) The second term of the right-hand side of is well-defined if and .&#10;If possesses an additional decay such as with then the order in is&#10;replaced by at least when and given data are further small depending on&#10;. The precise statement on this result is stated in Theorem&#10;\[thm.nonlinear\].&#10;&#10;\(iv) The pressure is determined uniquely up to a constant and belongs to&#10;. Then, since , the coefficient in is well-defined.&#10;&#10;\(v) In Theorem \[thm.main\] we assume that the external force is of&#10;divergence form. In fact, this is not an essential assumption, and it is&#10;possible to deal with the external force satisfying with the smallness&#10;in these norms, and the asymptotic expansion is verified if in addition.&#10;This is obtained by using the recent result by the authors in the whole&#10;space which solves the linearized problem for satisfying . Although this&#10;result is not so trivial since the condition is just in the&#10;scale-critical regime, we focus only on of divergence form in this&#10;paper, for the argument becomes shorter due to the fact that the&#10;nonlinear term is also written in the divergence form as .&#10;&#10;As far as the authors know, Theorem \[thm.main\] is the first general&#10;existence result of the flows around a rotating obstacle [IN THE&#10;TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE]{}. Before stating the idea of the proof of Theorem&#10;\[thm.main\], let us recall some known results on the mathematical&#10;analysis of flows around a rotating obstacle.&#10;&#10;So far the mathematical results on this topic have been obtained mainly&#10;for the three-dimensional problem, as listed below. For the&#10;nonstationary problem the existence of global weak solutions is proved&#10;by Borchers , and the unique existence of time-local regular solutions&#10;is shown by Hishida and Geissert, Heck, and Hieber , while the global&#10;strong solutions for small data are obtained by Galdi and Silvestre .&#10;The spectrum of the linear operator related to this problem is studied&#10;by Farwig and Neustupa ; see also the linear analysis by Hishida . The&#10;existence of stationary solutions to the associated system is proved in&#10;, Silvestre , Galdi , and Farwig and Hishida . In particular, in the&#10;stationary flows with the decay order are obtained, while the work of is&#10;based on the weak framework, which is another natural scale-critical&#10;space for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Our Theorem&#10;\[thm.main\] is considered as a two-dimensional counterpart of the&#10;three-dimensional result of . In D case the asymptotic profiles of these&#10;stationary flows at spatial infinity are studied by Farwig and Hishida&#10;and Farwig, Galdi, and Kyed , where it is proved that the asymptotic&#10;profiles are described by the Landau solutions, stationary self-similar&#10;solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in . It is worthwhile to&#10;mention that, also in the two-dimensional case, the asymptotic profile&#10;is given by the stationary self-similar solution , as is shown in&#10;Theorem \[thm.main\]. The stability of the above stationary solutions&#10;has been well studied in the three-dimensional case; The global&#10;stability is proved in , and the local stability is obtained by Hishida&#10;and Shibata .&#10;&#10;All results mentioned above are in the three-dimensional case, while&#10;only a few results are known so far for the flow around a rotating&#10;obstacle in the two-dimensional case. Recently an important progress has&#10;been made by Hishida , where the asymptotic behavior of the&#10;two-dimensional stationary Stokes flow around a rotating obstacle is&#10;investigated in details. The equations studied in are written as Here is&#10;a given smooth function on . It is proved in that if and the smooth&#10;external force satisfies the decay conditions then the solution to&#10;decaying at spatial infinity obeys the asymptotic expansion where The&#10;result of leads to an important conclusion that the rotation of the&#10;obstacle resolves the Stokes paradox (see Chang and Finn for the&#10;rigorous description of the Stokes paradox) as in the Oseen resolution.&#10;We recall that when the obstacle is translating with a constant velocity&#10;the Navier-Stokes flows have been constructed by Finn and Smith for&#10;small but nonzero through the analysis of the Oseen linearization; see&#10;also Galdi . The resolution of the Stokes paradox for is due to the fact&#10;that the rotation removes the logarithmic singularity of the associated&#10;fundamental solution, which has been well known for the Oseen problem.&#10;&#10;As a reference to the D exterior problem related with ours, the reader&#10;is referred to a recent work by Hillairet and Wittwer , where the&#10;stationary problem of is discussed when and the boundary condition is&#10;given as with a smooth and time-independent . We note that the&#10;stationary flow exactly solves this problem when . When is large enough&#10;and is sufficiently small the stationary solutions are constructed in&#10;around the explicit solution , where a number close to . Although the&#10;problem discussed in is in fact different from ours due to the&#10;time-independent given data in the original frame , the solutions&#10;obtained in share a common property with the ones in Theorem&#10;\[thm.main\] in view of their asymptotic behaviors at spatial infinity.&#10;&#10;It is well known that the existence of stationary Navier-Stokes flows in&#10;two-dimensional exterior domains (hence, formally in ) is an open&#10;problem in general. Partial results related to this problem have been&#10;obtained by Galdi , Russo , Yamazaki , and Pileckas and Russo , where&#10;the solutions are constructed under some symmetry conditions on both&#10;domains and given data. In particular, the Navier-Stokes flows decaying&#10;in the scale-critical order are obtained in in this category. The&#10;uniqueness is also available again under some symmetry conditions, see&#10;Nakatsuka .&#10;&#10;The stability of the stationary solutions obtained in or in Theorem&#10;\[thm.main\] is a highly challenging issue due to their spatial decay in&#10;the scale-critical order in two-dimensions, and it is still an open&#10;question in general. The difficulty is brought from the fact that the&#10;Hardy inequality , , does not hold when is an exterior domain in . As&#10;far as the authors know, the only result available so far is by the&#10;second author of this paper, where the local stability is established&#10;for the special solution , , when is the exterior domain to the unit&#10;disk.&#10;&#10;Finally, let us state the key idea for the proof of Theorem&#10;\[thm.main\]. Our approach is motivated by the linear analysis developed&#10;in , where is obtained through the detailed analysis of the fundamental&#10;solution associated to the system in . The expansion strongly indicates&#10;that the similar asymptotics is valid also for the Navier-Stokes flow,&#10;since the leading profile in is a stationary self-similar solution to&#10;the Navier-Stokes equations in . Thus our strategy for the proof of&#10;Theorem \[thm.main\] can be summarized as follows: we derive at the same&#10;time the unique existence of solutions and their asymptotic behavior&#10;under the smallness condition on the given data in . The solution of the&#10;form of is constructed through the Banach fixed point theorem, where&#10;both the coefficient and the remainder term are sufficiently small&#10;corresponding to the size of . However, it is far from trivial to&#10;justify this idea directly from the results of , especially to ensure&#10;the smallness of in the iteration scheme. Indeed, there are at least two&#10;difficulties for this procedure: (I) the condition is slightly&#10;restrictive to handle the nonlinear term in the scale-critical&#10;framework, and more seriously, (II) the singularity on in for can&#10;prevent us closing the nonlinear estimates. In fact, the smooth flows&#10;subject to the system are pointwise bounded above by near the boundary&#10;due to the boundary condition .&#10;&#10;For resolving the difficulty (I), the structure of the nonlinear term is&#10;essential. Indeed, the symmetry of the tensor leads to a crucial&#10;cancellation for the coefficient “”, which removes a possible&#10;singularity caused by the scale-critical decay of the flow. To overcome&#10;the difficulty (II), we revisit the argument of analyzing the&#10;fundamental solution to in and modify the singularity of in the&#10;estimates of the remainder term for the linear problem; see Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.whole\], Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\], and Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.exterior\]. Applying these improved estimates, the&#10;nonlinear problem is solved by the Banach fixed point theorem. However,&#10;the argument becomes complicated since we have to control two kinds of&#10;norms; the one bounds the local quantity, while the other one controls&#10;the spatial decay. This machinery is needed since the flow in a far&#10;field region () exhibits a different dependence on from the flow in a&#10;finite fluid region, and in principle, the problem becomes more singular&#10;at as is decreasing. In order to close the nonlinear estimates it is&#10;important to distinguish these two dependences on and to estimate their&#10;interaction through the nonlinearity carefully.&#10;&#10;This paper is organized as follows. In Section \[sec.pre\] the basic&#10;results on the oscillatory integrals are collected, which are used to&#10;establish the pointwise estimates of the fundamental solution to with a&#10;milder singularity on , . In Section \[sec.linear\] the linearized&#10;problem with is studied in details. Section \[subsec.linear.whole\] is&#10;devoted to the analysis in , while the exterior problem is discussed in&#10;Section \[subsec.linear.exterior\]. Finally the nonlinear problem is&#10;solved in Section \[sec.nonlinear\].">

Hence, by the definition stated above, any weak solution to is&#10;represented as and is given by , as long as the condition (i) or (ii) on&#10;in Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\] is assumed.&#10;&#10;We note that in (ii) of Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\] the coefficient is&#10;always well-defined when . The asymptotic expansion for the case (i) is&#10;firstly established by . Indeed, for the case (i) it is shown in that&#10;decays at infinity as , while the singularity appears in the coefficient&#10;of the estimates there. The novelty of Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\] are&#10;and , where both the consistency in the weighted spaces and the milder&#10;singularity on for small are essential to solve the nonlinear problem in&#10;Section \[sec.nonlinear\]. On the other hand, as in , the key step to&#10;prove Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\] is the expansion and the pointwise&#10;estimate of the fundamental solution , which are stated in Lemma&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\] below. The fundamental solution is studied in&#10;details in and we will revisit the argument developed by in the proof of&#10;this lemma.&#10;&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\] Set&#10;&#10;Then for the kernel satisfies&#10;&#10;Here is the Kronecker delta and is independent of , , and .&#10;&#10;The case of is obtained in but with dependence of the coefficients in&#10;the estimate. The case is not stated explicitly in , although it can be&#10;handled in the similar spirit as in the case . In this sense Lemma&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\] is not completely new, and is an improvement&#10;of with respect to the singularity on for .&#10;&#10;[Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\]]{} In principle, our proof of Lemma&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\] will proceed along the line of . In fact, the&#10;only key difference of out proof for the case is the application of&#10;Lemmas \[lem.thm.linear.whole.2\], \[lem.thm.linear.whole.3\] in&#10;suitable parts. In the proof for the case , the inequality will be&#10;essentially used in addition.&#10;&#10;Following the argument of , we decompose and define , , and as We also&#10;decompose and define , , , and as Then, by Lemma&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.2\] the following representations hold: where we&#10;have used the equality To prove we observe that Let us estimate each&#10;term in the right-hand side of the above inequality. The key idea is to&#10;use the Taylor formula for around as follows. where and . To estimate we&#10;use the identity Let . Then we have from and , Here we have used for the&#10;second term and used the condition for the third term to achieve the&#10;last line. Clearly the last term in the right-hand side of is bounded&#10;from above by for , while in virtue of the first term is estimated as&#10;Thus we have arrived at Next we consider the derivative estimate for .&#10;Let us go back to the definition of in . Then is computed as By applying&#10;the first term is bounded from above by . To estimate the second term we&#10;observe that Then, by using the second term in the right-hand side of is&#10;bounded from above by . Hence we have shown that Exactly in the same way&#10;we obtain for and , Next we estimate the term . By the Taylor expansion&#10;stated in , we decompose and define , , and as For the last term it is&#10;straightforward to see from that, for , To estimate the first two terms&#10;we observe where Then, by using and by applying the term is estimated as&#10;Next we see where each component of the matrices and is a fourth order&#10;polynomial of written as a suitable sum of the terms with and , while is&#10;estimated as for . Thus we have from and , Summing up , , and , we&#10;obtain To estimate the derivatives in of we recall the definition of in&#10;and use , which leads to the representation From the expression of in ,&#10;we have for , Here we have used . Next we estimate the derivatives of ,&#10;which are computed as To estimate we observe that and that Here we have&#10;used for the first term and for the second term to derive the last line.&#10;It remains to estimate in . Below we consider the case only, for the&#10;case is obtained in the same manner. The direct computation yields the&#10;following key identity: Here and are the matrices whose components are&#10;suitable sums of the third order polynomials of the form with , while is&#10;estimated as for . Hence, recalling the expression of in , we have Here,&#10;we have again applied for the first term and for the second term to&#10;derive the last line. Finally we have Collecting , , , and , we have&#10;shown that The estimate of is obtained in the similar manner. Thus, from&#10;and we have obtained the estimates of the derivatives in for . The proof&#10;of Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\] is complete.&#10;&#10;[Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\]]{} The assertion that is a weak solution&#10;to (whose definitions are stated in the beginning of this subsection)&#10;follows from a similar argument as in . So we omit the details on this&#10;part and we focus on the proof for the estimates of here. (i) Let .&#10;Suppose that for some . Note that holds. Let . Then we have from Lemma&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\] with , which implies with Here is independent&#10;of , , , , and . Then we use the inequality for , which leads to .&#10;&#10;\(ii) Let and write and . From the integration by parts we see for and ,&#10;Note that by the definition of . Moreover, we have for by , and by ,&#10;which implies for . For simplicity we use the next notations: Then we&#10;have The sum of the first three terms of the right-hand side of this&#10;equality is denoted by . To estimate we firstly observe from Lemma&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\], Next we have from the direct calculation&#10;which implies Then by the transformation of the variables we have Here&#10;is independent of and . Collecting , , and , we obtain and . The proof&#10;of Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\] is complete.&#10;&#10;Based on the results of Theorem \[thm.linear.whole\] we study the&#10;exterior problem in the next subsection, where its asymptotic profile is&#10;represented as the solution to by a cut-off technique. However, the&#10;existence of solutions to decaying at spatial infinity has to be proved&#10;carefully. As in , for the exterior problem, a natural way to construct&#10;solutions decaying at spatial infinity is to consider first a&#10;regularized system and to take the limit; see the proof of Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.exterior\] for details. In this procedure we need to&#10;consider the following system in the whole space: where is a small&#10;positive number. Let us introduce the integral kernel as In virtue of&#10;the positive , the integral in converges absolutely for . Furthermore,&#10;the velocity defined by satisfies in the sense of distributions with a&#10;suitable pressure . The next lemma will be used in the proof of Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.exterior\].&#10;&#10;\[lem.thm.linear.exterior.1\] Let and . Suppose that is of the form with&#10;some . Then for any and , the velocity defined by satisfies Here the&#10;constant is independent of and , and depends only on and .&#10;&#10;In the same way as in the proof of Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\], we&#10;define by where Then we have where the constant is independent of and .&#10;By the integration by parts we rewrite as Then, proceeding as in the&#10;proof of Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\], we obtain where is&#10;independent of , , , and . Then we have where the constant is&#10;independent of and . The second term in the right-hand side of is also&#10;estimated as in the proof of Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.whole.1\], resulting&#10;the estimate For the last term in the right-hand side of it is&#10;straightforward from to see Collecting , , and , we obtain .

Let us recall that is taken so that and is a radial&#10;cut-off function such that for and for . As in the proof of Lemma&#10;\[lem.linear.exterior\], we introduce the Bogovskii operator in the&#10;closed annulus , and set Recall that satisfies Then satisfies where Note&#10;that due to . Let be the function defined in . Then, as is shown in (see&#10;also Remark \[rem.thm.linear.whole\]), the velocity is written as Since&#10;for , we have from , Since we have from , Combining this estimate with&#10;and , we obtain Here depends only on and , but is independent of . As&#10;for , from Lemma \[lem.thm.linear.exterior.1\], there is such that&#10;Collecting , , , and with its uniform bound on , we have a uniform&#10;estimate in : where the Sobolev embedding has been applied. Thus, there&#10;are a subsequence, denoted again by , and , such that in , in , and in .&#10;It is easy to see that satisfies in the sense of distributions (note&#10;that each term of makes sense at least as a function in ). The proof of&#10;the existence is complete.&#10;&#10;(Estimates) We note that the solution obtained in the existence proof&#10;above satisfies in virtue of . Thus holds. Since the pressure is&#10;uniquely determined up to a constant, we may assume . Then we have from&#10;, Here depends only on . This proves . The local estimates follow from&#10;the standard cut-off argument and the elliptic estimates for the Stokes&#10;system in bounded domains, together with the estimates and . Since the&#10;argument is rather standard, we omit the details here. The expansion&#10;with and the estimate follow from Lemma \[lem.linear.exterior\] and .&#10;Note that the constant vector in must be zero, for the solution&#10;constructed here decays as . The proof of Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.exterior\] is complete.&#10;&#10;Let be as in Theorem \[thm.linear.exterior\] and let . Then we have for&#10;, Here is independent of and . Since we have for and , by using , Here&#10;is independent of , , and . The estimate plays a central role to solve&#10;the Navier-Stokes equations for small in the next section. We note that&#10;and the last term in the right-hand side of do not converge in general&#10;when . In solving the Navier-Stokes equations, especially for the case ,&#10;it is crucial that we only need the decay of the component , which&#10;always vanishes when is symmetric.">

<outline text="Solvability of nonlinear problem" _note="Based on the linear analysis in the previous sections the following&#10;Navier-Stokes equations are studied in this section: Our aim is to&#10;prove, under some conditions on , the unique existence of solutions to&#10;satisfying the asymptotic behavior for some , where is a radial circular&#10;flow defined by and coincides with for . As in the previous sections we&#10;fix a positive number large enough so that , and let be a radial cut-off&#10;function satisfying for , for . Set which is a radial circular flow&#10;supported in the ball . We also introduce the function space , , as&#10;which is the Banach space under the norm for : We sketch the proof that&#10;is complete. It suffices to show the completeness of the space . Suppose&#10;that is a Cauchy sequence. Then there exist and such that and as . What&#10;we need to show is . To show this, set . Note that the fact implies on .&#10;Then, for any such that is compact, the integration by parts yields for&#10;, Since we may take an arbitrary we first conclude from the above&#10;computation that is a constant in , denoted by . Next we have for such&#10;that is compact, where the result of the above computation is used. This&#10;implies since we can choose so that . Thus we obtain , and hence, is&#10;complete.&#10;&#10;Let us recall that for of the form with some satisfying the coefficients&#10;and in and are well-defined. The main results of this section are&#10;Theorems \[thm.nonlinear\], \[thm.nonlinear’\] below. Let us start from&#10;the next theorem.&#10;&#10;\[thm.nonlinear\] Let . There exists a positive constant such that the&#10;following statement holds. Suppose that is of the form with some , and&#10;in addition that when . If and then there exists a unique solution to&#10;satisfying and enjoying the expression with and defined by and ,&#10;respectively, and while and if , Here , , , and depend only on and , and&#10;are taken uniformly with respect to in each compact subset of .&#10;&#10;\(i) A careful analysis implies that in Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] is&#10;estimated as where depends only on . But we do not go into details in&#10;this paper.&#10;&#10;\(ii) In Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] when the term decays with the order&#10;and there is no reason why provides a leading term of the asymptotic&#10;behavior of at . To achieve this asymptotics we need the additional&#10;decay of such as ; see Theorem \[thm.nonlinear’\] below.&#10;&#10;[Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\]]{} In the following argument we will freely&#10;use the condition . We look for the solution to of the form We need to&#10;determine and . Inserting into , we see that is the solution to the&#10;system Here and we may assume that . Note that we have used the&#10;relations , and the radial scalar function is taken so that . Both of&#10;these follow from the direct calculation. The proof of the unique&#10;existence below relies on the standard Banach fixed point argument in a&#10;suitable class of functions. To this end we introduce the closed convex&#10;set in : Here we have set , and the positive numbers with will be&#10;suitably determined later. We note that the following inclusion always&#10;holds for . For any , let be the unique solution in Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.exterior\] to the linear system Our aim is to show the&#10;unique existence of such that for suitably chosen and sufficiently small&#10;and . We remark that the value need not to be small when is positive.&#10;Let us start from the estimates for . Firstly we estimate its norm as&#10;Here, for the nonlinear term, we have used and the smallness of and to&#10;obtain On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that and Then we&#10;can apply the result of Theorem \[thm.linear.exterior\]. To simplify the&#10;notation we set From , , and , we have Moreover, by the Sobolev&#10;embedding and - combined with , , , , and , we have Set and . By Theorem&#10;\[thm.linear.exterior\], the velocity is written as where belongs to and&#10;is given by We observe that and Here we have used the facts that is&#10;symmetric and its trace on the boundary is zero. This implies .&#10;Moreover, we have in virtue of the computation Here and we have used the&#10;identity near . Hence, is in fact written as&#10;&#10;Now let us define the mapping as Recalling the inclusion , our aim is to&#10;show&#10;&#10;\(i) is a mapping from into , and&#10;&#10;\(ii) is a contraction on in the topology of . i.e., there is such that&#10;for any .&#10;&#10;The properties (i) and (ii) imply the existence of the fixed point of in&#10;even for the case . Indeed, note that the sequence defined by and for is&#10;a Cauchy sequence in and each belongs to , which is not difficult to see&#10;from (i) and (ii). Then the limit of in also belongs to since is a&#10;closed subset in by the definition.&#10;&#10;To prove (i) let us estimate based on the representation . By the trace&#10;theorem we have Hence we have from , Next let us estimate . Firstly we&#10;observe from , , and that On the other hand, we have from and by the&#10;condition , for any , where is independent of , , and . Here we have&#10;used that is symmetric and that for by its definition. Note that holds,&#10;which will be used later. Combining with , , , , and , we obtain for ,&#10;Now we observe that for sufficiently small and (depending only on so&#10;far) the function is bounded from above as Here we have used the fact&#10;that is monotone increasing on , which implies . By taking , , and into&#10;account, we assume that , , , and are small enough so that Here is the&#10;largest constant of appearing in , , and (larger than without loss of&#10;generality), and then, is independent of and . Then for we see from ,&#10;Thus, and imply that for , Next we focus on . Taking with and (with )&#10;into account, we set as which is smaller than if and the data related to&#10;appearing in and are small enough, while is larger than since and for .&#10;Note that is also taken into account in the choice of . The key&#10;observation here is that, when , the numbers and are of the order and&#10;for , respectively. Then the term in the right-hand side of with is&#10;bounded from above by if and if and the data related to (and ) appearing&#10;in and are sufficiently small. Note that, since is at best of the order&#10;, the condition is crucial to ensure . Precisely, we need the smallness&#10;such as where Here the number depends only on and is independent of and&#10;, and we also note that does not contain the number in its definition.&#10;Under the above smallness condition we have from with and the choice of&#10;, as desired. In the above argument the number can be arbitrary.&#10;&#10;Next we estimate the norm (in the case is positive). To bound the term&#10;in the right-hand side of with , we need the additional smallness for&#10;and depending on : Precisely, in the case is positive, and are required&#10;to have the smallness as where the number depends on , contrary to the&#10;case of in . We note that and is taken so that it is monotone decreasing&#10;and continuous on in virtue of . Then we set as Then we can conclude&#10;from with and that It should be emphasized here that the argument works&#10;even if itself is large. We have now shown that is a mapping from into&#10;with the choice of in , , and for respectively.&#10;&#10;Next let us show that is a contraction mapping on . For convenience we&#10;set , and for , . We also set which is equal to , and hence, the&#10;velocity satisfies where . Here is given by Below we give the estimates&#10;of , where the estimate for the norm of the term has to be carefully&#10;computed: in principle, we need to estimate it by rather than , for&#10;their dependence on is essentially different. Due to the negative power&#10;on in the linear estimate this is crucial to show that is a contraction&#10;mapping. Because of this reasoning we apply in Lemma A.1 by recalling&#10;the bound , which yields Here we have used the smallness of . Similarly,&#10;also for the nonlinear term in we will apply . Then it follows that and&#10;on the other hand, it is not difficult to see Similarly, we observe that&#10;By applying Theorem \[thm.linear.exterior\], we have the representation&#10;of the velocity as Here we have used again, which follows from the&#10;symmetry of and from the fact that the trace of on is zero. Since and ,&#10;we see from the definitions of and in , and thus, we also have from and&#10;, In virtue of - we see A similar argument as in the derivation of&#10;yields Moreover, by applying we see that the term satisfies Here we have&#10;used again the symmetry of . Combining , , and with , , and , we obtain&#10;for sufficiently small and in , that is, the map is a contraction on .&#10;Here we have used the estimates and if and the data related to appearing&#10;are small enough. Therefore, there exists a fixed point of in , which is&#10;unique in . By the definition of in , we see that the fixed point&#10;satisfies which is the solution to , as desired. Let us set for the&#10;fixed point . The local regularity of as well as follows from the&#10;standard elliptic regularity of the Stokes operator by regarding the&#10;nonlinear term, which belongs to by the above construction, as a given&#10;external force. This leads to the regularity and for the solution to by&#10;. Next we observe that solves Here we have used the identity by the&#10;definition of . Let us take the approximation of of the form where is&#10;the radial cut-off function satisfying for , for , and , while is the&#10;Bogovskii operator in the closed annulus which satisfies and Here is&#10;independent of ; see, e.g. Borchers and Sohr . Then, by multiplying both&#10;sides of the first equation in and integrating over , we obtain from the&#10;integration by parts. Here we have used again the identity for the&#10;radial circular flow: . It is easy to see from and that as . As for the&#10;term we see It remains to consider the term . From the integration by&#10;parts and from , , and we have Here we have also used . Collecting these&#10;above, we have arrived at the identity In particular, from the Poincar&#10;inequality we obtain the estimate which shows for the case by the&#10;relation . Note that the constant in depends only on and is independent&#10;of and . To obtain the energy inequality for the case we first consider&#10;the approximation of and such that Then for and Here we have used the&#10;condition for the convergence of . Assume that and we fix . Then there&#10;is a unique fixed point of in . On the other hand, since is fixed, there&#10;is such that Here we have used the fact that and is continuous on .&#10;Hence, in view of and , there is such that Let with , , be the unique&#10;solution to with replaced by such that with some . Note that for&#10;sufficiently large , we can take the same and . Then implies Since we&#10;have uniform estimates of , and thus, we find a subsequence, denoted&#10;again by , such that , and strongly in . Moreover, we observe from that&#10;satisfies the energy inequality It is also easy to see that is a&#10;solution to and . By the uniqueness of the fixed point of in , we have .&#10;Therefore, holds with replaced by , as desired. Thus we have also when&#10;and .&#10;&#10;The estimates and follow from the fact and together with the definitions&#10;of in , , and when . As for the identity on the coefficient , we observe&#10;from , Since and near , where is a radial function and has been taken so&#10;that , the straightforward calculations yield Thus holds. The proof of&#10;Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] is complete.&#10;&#10;Finally we consider the case . Combining Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] with&#10;Theorem \[thm.nonlinear’\] below, we obtain Theorem \[thm.main\].&#10;&#10;\[thm.nonlinear’\] Assume that satisfies the conditions in Theorem&#10;\[thm.nonlinear\] for . Assume in addition that . Then the remainder in&#10;Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\] belongs to .&#10;&#10;The proof is very similar to the derivation of the energy inequality for&#10;the case in the proof of Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\]. We set and as in .&#10;Then and satisfy , and moreover, the additional condition implies The&#10;proof of is as follows: for any small number , there exists such that by&#10;the decay condition . Then we have which implies . As in the proof of&#10;Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\], let , , , be the solution to with replaced by&#10;such that with some . Since and , it suffices to show that converges to&#10;in , where is the solution to . To prove this we observe that the&#10;difference solves Here we have set , , and Then the same argument as in&#10;the derivation of shows where is independent of . Thus, converges to in&#10;, which shows . The proof is complete.&#10;&#10;We will prove the Hardy type inequality in two-dimensional exterior&#10;domains, which is used in the proof of Theorem \[thm.nonlinear\].&#10;&#10;[**Lemma A.1**]{}[ LET BE AN EXTERIOR DOMAIN IN . THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT&#10;FOR ANY . HERE DEPENDS ONLY ON . IN PARTICULAR, IF THEN ]{}&#10;&#10;Take and so that . By considering the zero extension of to , it suffices&#10;to show for and such that in . Fix . By the condition and the mean value&#10;theorem in the integral form we have which gives On the other hand, we&#10;have If then we obtain from and with . If then we take , which yields&#10;again from and that&#10;&#10;Here we have used and , and is a numerical constant. Thus holds.
