    <title>Modified entropies, their corresponding Newtonian forces, potentials,
and temperatures</title>
    <abstract>Assuming the hypothesis of the entropic nature of gravity, we calculate
generalized Newtonian forces, their associated potentials and field
equations, when other, in general non-extensive, entropies are
considered instead of the usual Boltzmann entropy. Some comments about
the nature of the correction terms presented are given, and a
calculation of corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature is
performed using the arguments which lead to what can be called a
Michell-Laplace black hole. </abstract>

<outline text="[sec:level1]Introduction" _note="One of the principal paradigms of our time is that of the fundamental&#10;forces in nature. We are taught that the electromagnetic, weak, strong&#10;and gravitational interactions control all natural phenomena. The&#10;Standard Model of particle Physics has made impressive achievements in&#10;unifying the first three into just one framework using the field&#10;concept. When this theory is quantized, the concept of particle arises,&#10;which is the basis of how we describe interactions. It is true that with&#10;quantum theory we can study systems like atoms or molecules, but the&#10;very core of the fundamental physics is field theory.\&#10;For gravity the story has not been as successful. Out of all of these&#10;forces, gravity does not yet have a fully workable quantization. Even&#10;less is known about how to unify gravity with the other forces. A&#10;perturbative quantum version of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity&#10;leads to divergences which are not renormalizable, so a complete quantum&#10;version of Einstein’s theory is needed. With such a theory we could&#10;solve the black hole information paradox , and answer questions about&#10;the beginning of our Universe, that is, the behavior of spacetime&#10;singularities. However, what if gravity is not a fundamental force? In&#10;the physics community there is some speculation about whether this&#10;constant failure to fully quantize gravity is due to the fact that we&#10;are trying to quantize an effective theory.\&#10;It is undeniable that General Relativity (GR) is an accurate theory&#10;which describes the dynamics of astronomical objects at scales from the&#10;solar system to clusters of galaxies. Also, the recent detection of&#10;gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration agrees well with the&#10;predictions of GR. Nevertheless, the question about whether GR is the&#10;ultimate theory is very relevant.\&#10;The resemblance of the so-called laws of black holes with that of&#10;thermodynamics first noticed by J.D. Bekenstein , along with many works&#10;of S. Hawking concerning the creation of particles by a gravitational&#10;field, or recently, the derivations of Einstein’s equations from entropy&#10;by T. Jacobson et al. , suggest that GR may be an effective theory. It&#10;is worth mentioning the work of M. van Raamsdonk et al. where the&#10;Einstein equations are derived from the LAWS OF ENTANGLEMENT.\&#10;All this having been said, the work of E. Verlinde on the derivation of&#10;Newton’s law of gravity using holographic arguments is in the same&#10;spirit as the above works. It is worth emphasizing that this derivation&#10;makes use of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation, which&#10;characterizes black holes. Verlinde suggests that gravity is an entropic&#10;phenomenon, a force resulting from the response in changes of&#10;information entropy which is stored in some holographic sphere.\&#10;Up to this point we have concentrated on General Relativity. However, it&#10;turns out that Newtonian gravity with a few modifications, along with&#10;some extremely simplified ideas from quantum field theory, allow us to&#10;obtain several important results from black hole theory. The authors&#10;have prepared a separate companion article where we discuss several uses&#10;of such an augmented Newtonian theory applied to black holes,&#10;calculating a “Hawking” temperature and the analog of the&#10;Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, giving a Newtonian version of Jacobson’s&#10;derivation of the Einstein field equations from entropy, and studying&#10;these ideas applied to a higher-derivative modified Newtonian gravity.\&#10;Since it seems to be true that Newton’s law is an entropic force, one&#10;should be able to modify it by considering more general entropies, and&#10;studying these modifications in order to gain insight into the&#10;corrections to GR that would give us these modifications in a Newtonian&#10;limit. Take, for example, the entropy derived from Loop Quantum Gravity&#10;(LQG) ; the corrections generated by this entropy are logarithmic and&#10;given in powers of the inverse of the area. It is possible to calculate&#10;the potential producing such a force. We would like to be able to find&#10;the field equation related to this new generalized Newtonian&#10;gravitation, and give some interpretation of such terms. Such&#10;corrections may come from the weak field approximation of a modification&#10;of GR. That is, given some generalized entropy, we can study the&#10;correction terms arising from this modification .\&#10;In this paper we attempt to find the field equations for modifications&#10;to Newton’s law arising from these generalized entropies and calculate&#10;the corresponding Newtonian potentials. In order to see how far our&#10;results can be carried out, we also compute corrections to the Hawking&#10;temperature, by making the same assumptions that lead to what we call a&#10;Michell-Laplace black hole. That is, by means of classical arguments, we&#10;can compute the radius of an object whose escape velocity is that of&#10;light. With this result, coupled with some extremely simplified concepts&#10;from quantum field theory, we can calculate the“Hawking” temperature of&#10;such an object by comparing its thermal energy with its total energy.\&#10;Finally, we will use the calculation of an entropy given by a simple&#10;calculation of a black hole entropy using the Clausius relation with the&#10;“Hawking” temperature. We can then compare this result with the usual&#10;entropy. This calculation leads to an interesting conundrum with respect&#10;to the entropy-area relation of these theories.">

<outline text="Quantum modifications to Newton’s Law" _note="We begin by reviewing the entropies we consider in this paper. As&#10;Bekenstein first noted, entropy is a concept linked to the geometry of&#10;some characteristic of the system. In the case of the black hole,&#10;entropy is related to the area of its event horizon, given by the&#10;expression , a formula due to Bekenstein and Hawking. It is known how to&#10;obtain corrections to this entropy that come from quantum gravity&#10;effects. It can be done by means of a path integral approach[^1] , or&#10;the trace anomaly , or counting spin states in Loop Quantum Gravity&#10;(LQG) . The expression is given by&#10;&#10;where and are very small parameters. The logarithmic correction arises&#10;as a consequence of several approaches.\&#10;The relation between entropy and the geometry of the system is exploited&#10;by Jacobson in his derivation of Einstein’s equations , where he made&#10;use of Clausius relation , and where the matter present is considered as&#10;a part of the energy. Verlinde uses this concept to derive the Newtonian&#10;law of gravitation. He interprets the entropy as information concerning&#10;the position of material bodies around a point mass at a distance ; all&#10;points at this distance define a sphere embedded in a three-dimensional&#10;space. Thus when we change the bits of information stored on the&#10;surface, a force appear as a reaction to that change. Choosing some&#10;constants, and assuming a linear relation between the quantity of bits&#10;stored and the area of such a sphere, the resulting entropic force is&#10;(note that we are assuming spherical coordinates)&#10;&#10;where is a unit radial vector. We arrive at the Newtonian force when we&#10;consider the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, . Note that the expression&#10;(\[EntropicForce\]) is general enough to allow us to consider different&#10;kinds of entropies. In fact, in the author uses the entropy (\[LQGe\])&#10;to derive a Newtonian cosmology through some modification of the&#10;Friedmann equations[^2]. The resulting force associated with the entropy&#10;(\[LQGe\]), is&#10;&#10;In particular for this entropy, the correction terms are quantum in&#10;nature, provided that the entropy is already quantum. As pointed out in&#10;, these correction terms are compatible with corrections coming from the&#10;area operator and the volume element in LQG.\&#10;At this stage we want to stress some more points about this force. It is&#10;well known that Newtonian gravitation is recovered from Einstein’s&#10;General Relativity in the weak field approximation. What is recovered is&#10;the field equation for some matter density, ,&#10;&#10;where is the potential function that gives rise to the force, and is the&#10;three-dimensional, flat-space Laplacian. The potential function for the&#10;force (\[LQGForce\]) can be computed straightforwardly ,&#10;&#10;and&#10;&#10;Now, given we would like to go further and find a modified Newtonian&#10;field equation that would have the of Eq. (\[qPotential\]) as its&#10;solution. This, of course, is difficult. It is like asking, given an&#10;ordinary function , what differential equation would have such a&#10;function as its solution. Without some restriction on the differential&#10;equation there are an infinite number of answers. In the case of Eq.&#10;(\[qFieldEq\]) one possibility is to simply assume that (\[FieldEq\]) is&#10;valid with some effective matter density, , with&#10;&#10;where would be due to some sort of “quantum foam” generated by the&#10;existence of a point mass by means of an unknown quantum process.&#10;Another, somewhat more conventional philosophy, would be to assume that&#10;is generated from a point mass using some higher-order Newtonian limit&#10;of an unknown quantum gravity theory where the matter density is zero&#10;outside the point mass.\&#10;As an exercise, the simple form of (a sum of functions of the form )&#10;allows us to mock up one possibility of an ad hoc field equation with&#10;only a point source on the right-hand-side. There is certainly no&#10;guarantee that this procedure would give a desirable field equation.&#10;However, one such equation can be cobbled together by writing&#10;&#10; the potential above and the Heaviside step function,&#10;&#10;With some numerical juggling the following combination gives a delta&#10;function point source for (notice that the radial direction appears, so&#10;this equation is only valid for spherically symmetric potentials),&#10;&#10;with and . We now have \[with as given in (\[qPotential\])\],&#10;&#10;The final equation becomes (using and the well-known relations and )&#10;&#10;The right-hand-side of this equation is rather clumsy and quite&#10;singular, which indicates that it is probably not a desirable field&#10;equation. However, Gauss’s law implies that an integral of over a sphere&#10;of radius has terms in negative powers of , making a simple point mass&#10;source impossible. As we mention in the companion article, entropies of&#10;this sort may possibly be used to find field equations using the results&#10;of Jacobson et al. , that are consistent with modified entropies.\&#10;We would like to stress that under the assumption of this entropic&#10;nature of gravity, field equations derived from quantum corrections to&#10;the entropy would correspond to an associated generalized gravity whose&#10;weak field approximation must be this field equation. This may give some&#10;insight into possible terms that correct the Einstein equations in the&#10;quantum realm. For example, consider the Born-Oppenheimer approximation&#10;as applied by C. Kiefer , where the terms may be manifestations of heavy&#10;degrees of freedom, as they have been decoupled from the lighter ones&#10;which come from matter fields. At the present we do not have any idea of&#10;what such terms might be in the modified theories of gravity, but we are&#10;pursuing the matter at what we assume to be the linearized level.\&#10;As this example teaches us, Eq. (\[EntropicForce\]) should be general&#10;enough to allow us to consider other entropies, and lead us to find the&#10;corresponding potential functions and entropic forces. We note the&#10;appearance of the Planck length as a characteristic parameter. We are&#10;now going to consider other entropies very different from the one we&#10;have just discussed.&#10;&#10;[^1]: In . The authors perform the calculation considering&#10;    noncommutativity in such black hole models.&#10;&#10;[^2]: We also cite for a study of entropic correction terms in&#10;    cosmology.">

<outline text="Entropies derived from superstatistics" _note="One of the main characteristics of Boltzmann entropy is that it is&#10;extensive, the sum of the entropies for any two parts of a given system&#10;is the entropy of the system as a whole. Generalizing this entropy comes&#10;with the drawback that this property is, in general, lost. However,&#10;non-extensive entropies seem to be rewarding examples of more general&#10;phenomena. In Ref. the authors treat a broad range of entropies using&#10;different Boltzmann factors, which have been called SUPERSTATISTICS,&#10;obtained from different temperature distributions. In particular, we&#10;consider the cases of the Tsallis entropy , and the one reported in ;&#10;(see also ).\&#10;There are many examples where the Tsallis entropy appears, ranging from&#10;statistical systems to particle physics . It relies heavily on a free&#10;parameter that takes different values for each system. The entropy&#10;reduces to Boltzmann’s when this parameter is one. The other example is&#10;an entropy that depends solely on the probability, and differs from the&#10;Boltzmann entropy for large probabilities when the states of the systems&#10;are not large enough. A recent review of this entropy and some of its&#10;features is in . In , the authors discuss the discrepancy for a 2d CFT.&#10;They calculate the corrections to a 2dCFT and show that they correspond&#10;to an length-dependent entanglement entropy .\&#10;For now, let us explicitly give the functional form of these&#10;entropies[^1]:&#10;&#10;For the Tsallis entropy&#10;&#10;For the entropy of Obregón[^2]&#10;&#10;From Eq.(\[tsal\]) is easy to see that when we recover the Boltzmann&#10;entropy for Tsallis case, and for the Obregón case we have the same&#10;Boltzmann entropy as a first term in the expansion.\&#10;In order to calculate the potential function of the forces these&#10;entropies produce, we need to express these same entropies in a&#10;convenient form. Consider the special case of equiprobability, assuming&#10;a number of states; that is, . Furthermore, we associate the Boltzmann&#10;entropy with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a black hole, linear in&#10;the black hole area. As a result, the entropies we are going to use take&#10;the following forms&#10;&#10;These entropies will then depend on the area through the&#10;Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Both the LQG entropy and the entropy of&#10;(\[OEntropy\]) can be written in the form&#10;&#10;with the term including the corrections to the BH entropy relation. (We&#10;will consider the Tsallis entropy later, since it has a different&#10;form.)\&#10;For these two entropies the associated forces are Eq. (\[LQGForce\]),&#10;and for (\[OEntropy\]) (expanded to first order in the doubled&#10;potential) are&#10;&#10;The potential function for this entropic force is easily calculated. For&#10;the LQG force we have (\[qPotential\]), and for the entropy&#10;(\[OEntropy\]),&#10;&#10;In what follows we will be interested in values of large compared to ,&#10;so the argument of the error function will be very large, so we can use&#10;its asymptotic expansion, the first term of which is , and&#10;&#10;Notice that both of these potentials (\[qPotential\]) and (\[OEntropy\])&#10;are of the form&#10;&#10; very small for large .\&#10;In our companion article we have studied this class of potentials in&#10;several situations that will be relevant in the next section. One other&#10;equation we will need is the force associated with potentials of this&#10;form, that is, ,&#10;&#10;As previously, we can either consider the field equation for to be&#10;&#10;where in the case of Eq. (\[OPotential\]),&#10;&#10;Here any attempt to find a modified field equation for the potential&#10;(\[OPotentialA\]) whose right-hand-side is zero by simply guessing is&#10;essentially impossible, so we will not attempt it.\&#10;Returning to the case of the Tsallis entropy, we will see that it is not&#10;useful to expand the exponential because we expect the exponent in the&#10;resulting force to be very large and negative. We now have, replacing by&#10;,&#10;&#10;Now, is simple and the resulting force from Eq. (\[EntropicForce\]) is&#10;&#10;The associated potential is&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, if we use the asymptotic form of we used in&#10;(\[OPotentialA\]) the two terms in cancel, so we must take the second&#10;term in its asymptotic series, , and&#10;&#10;If we try to expand to the first two terms in the exponential, we find&#10;the resulting becomes positive for very large and the force becomes&#10;repulsive. It is best to leave this as it is.\&#10;We can calculate to find a directly as , but unfortunately turns out to&#10;be negative. However, the very simple form of does allow us to find a&#10;reasonable ad hoc field equation with zero on the right-hand-side. We&#10;have&#10;&#10;and&#10;&#10;This equation still singularizes the radial direction, so it is also&#10;only applicable to spherically symmetric potentials.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Note that in the expressions we are dealing with dimensionless&#10;    quantities, we are already dividing the entropy by the Boltzmann&#10;    constant, .&#10;&#10;[^2]: There is yet another entropy of the form which might be of&#10;    interest.">

<outline text="Corrections to the temperature of a black hole" _note="As an application of previous results, we calculate corrections to the&#10;temperature of a black hole by a non-orthodox method. Since we are&#10;working in a Newtonian framework, we compute such temperature using the&#10;assumptions that lead us to what in our companion article we call a&#10;Michell-Laplace black hole, which is a massive object whose escape&#10;velocity is equal to the speed of light. In our derivation, we are going&#10;to make use of the potential functions we have given in the previous&#10;section.\&#10;Although this is a non-relativistic argument, we can obtain a rough&#10;estimate of the corrections to the temperature for the black hole.&#10;Consider a spherical object of mass . Using conservation of energy, we&#10;can calculate the radius of this object must have in order for its&#10;escape velocity to be the speed of light. Considering the sum of the&#10;kinetic and potential energy of a projectile of mass , we have&#10;&#10;If at an initial radius , and the particle arrives at infinity with zero&#10;velocity,&#10;&#10;In our companion article we call the MICHELL-LAPLACE RADIUS since it was&#10;first calculated independently by Michell and Laplace in the 18th&#10;century. For the Newtonian potential, consider the production of a pair&#10;of virtual particles of mass and , at a distance , the Compton&#10;wavelength of the mass . We assume that for some reason the negative&#10;mass particle always falls into the black hole (otherwise there would be&#10;no black hole evaporation) and the other moves radially away with&#10;velocity c. Using Eq. (\[EnergyPerMass\]), the energy of the particle is&#10;&#10;In the last expression we assumed in order to perform the approximation.&#10;By conservation of energy, comparing this result with the energy of the&#10;particle at infinity, , we get&#10;&#10;We take this energy to correspond to a thermal energy of (), which gives&#10;a temperature of&#10;&#10;which, up to a constant, is the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature. In our&#10;companion article we call this the MICHELL-LAPLACE-HAWKING TEMPERATURE,&#10;.\&#10;In addition, we can compute the entropy of this system starting with the&#10;infall of a mass into the black hole with velocity . The increment in&#10;energy is , and using the Clausius relation , we have&#10;&#10;which upon integration yields,&#10;&#10;This is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, , up to a constant factor.\&#10;As we said before, by this line of reasoning we are able to get a rough&#10;estimate of the temperature of a black hole, leading us to ask what the&#10;changes to this temperature would result if we used the above potentials&#10;associated with the entropies we are considering.\&#10;In , we considered ’s of the form (\[GenPot\]), where is very small.&#10;Since&#10;&#10;we have&#10;&#10;and assuming that , small, it is easy to show that&#10;&#10;Now, for a particle of mass having at velocity ,&#10;&#10;Expanding to first order in , and using (\[MLCondition\]),&#10;&#10;Using , we finally have&#10;&#10;( the Planck mass). It will be useful below to have as a function of ,&#10;so inserting as a function of , we find&#10;&#10;For the LQG entropy we have&#10;&#10;and for the entropy (\[OEntropy\]) where ,&#10;&#10;For the Tsallis entropy, using (\[TsallisApprox\]), we have&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to approximate this&#10;transcendental equation to give an approximate analytic solution for as&#10;a function of . However, if we write , we find&#10;&#10;so even for large masses, is essentially Planckian.\&#10;If, notwithstanding, we formally expand to first order in , we have&#10;&#10;Without an analytic solution for as a function of , we cannot find&#10;easily.">

<outline text="Closing the circle" _note="An interesting check of the concepts that inform this article and its&#10;companion can be called “closing the circle.” In this article we began&#10;with several general definitions of entropy written as a function of ,&#10;the Boltzmann entropy. Identifying with a black hole area, , and then&#10;based on the work of Verlinde we constructed modified Newtonian forces&#10;by replacing with .\&#10;Now, once we have a modified Newtonian force and its associated&#10;potential , we can use the results of Sec. 4 to calculate a&#10;Michell-Laplace black hole radius, , and a Michell-Laplace-Hawking&#10;temperature, , of the black hole. We can now close the circle by using&#10;the idea of Eq. (\[Clausius\]) to calculate an entropy as a function of&#10;or , the black hole mass. This entropy can be written as a function of&#10;the black hole area, , and it should be the same as the initial entropy&#10;for each one of the cases considered.\&#10;We will use the entropies where to test this hypothesis. From Eq.&#10;(\[Clausius\]) we have&#10;&#10;For reasons that will become clear below, we will express both as a&#10;function of and . First substituting to find , we have&#10;&#10;so&#10;&#10;As a function of we have&#10;&#10;Integration by parts gives us&#10;&#10;We now want to “close the circle” by writing as a function of area with&#10;the original with replaced by . Obviously the black hole area is . To&#10;avoid the integrals in (\[Entropy1\]) and (\[Entropy2\]) we would like&#10;to compare with replaced by with what we found in Eq. (\[force\]). For&#10;as a function of , we have , and from (\[difEntropy\]), we have&#10;&#10;Obviously this is far from the force given in (\[force\]).\&#10;If, however, we define an “area” we will call the SCHWARZSCHILD AREA, ,&#10;as , which has no relation to the area of the black hole, we find, using&#10;,&#10;&#10;Since we have used the formula from the pure Newtonian calculation which&#10;has an extra factor, we expect the force to be (as in our companion&#10;article),&#10;&#10;and&#10;&#10;While this result is almost of the form of of Eq. (\[force\]), the sign&#10;of the last term in brackets is wrong, so in neither of these cases does&#10;the circle close. While the circle closes in ordinary Newtonian theory,&#10;it does not in our cases.\&#10;This conundrum could be due to several factors, for example, a&#10;straightforward application of the formula of Verlinde to generate the&#10;force or maybe the use of the simple relation between and . It is&#10;difficult to see how to modify Verlinde’s formula for a more complex&#10;Newtonian theory. In our companion article a similar mismatch occurs&#10;when we begin with a black hole solution to a specific modified&#10;Newtonian theory. There the force is already known, and the force&#10;derived from applying the Verlinde formula also does not match.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="If gravity is not a fundamental force, as previously suggested , then&#10;avenue opens which can lead to new concepts and paradigms. Searching for&#10;new effects through terms that correct some properties might give us an&#10;opportunity to find such effects. In the present work we use simple&#10;arguments in order to show how generalized entropies may give the&#10;corrections we are looking for, corrections to Newtonian forces,&#10;potentials, and to the Hawking temperature.\&#10;As we discussed in the main text, in the case of the quantum entropy we&#10;are able to interpret such correction terms as coming from the weak&#10;field approximation to a (still unknown) generalized gravity with&#10;further terms due to the quantum corrections to the entropy. If this&#10;entropic concept happens to be true, the “weak field” approximation for&#10;such an effective quantum gravity has to have as classical limit the&#10;Newtonian law we have just found. Although we can interpret these terms&#10;as effective matter densities, modifications to the Laplace operator&#10;seems perhaps to be a better idea. While the ad hoc equations&#10;(\[laplacian1\]) and (\[laplacian2\]) are not at all promising, we may&#10;be able to use modifications of the ideas of Jacobson et al. . We are&#10;pursuing the matter at present.\&#10;As a concluding note, modifications to the one-quarter-of-area formula&#10;for the entropy were considered previously in , for example, by means of&#10;the Noether charge approach in modified theories of gravity. These&#10;authors consider Newton’s constant explicitly in the Bekenstein-Hawking&#10;, writing[^1] . For modified theories they write , a modified (or&#10;effective) Newton’s constant. Of course, the expressions for our&#10;entropies can be written in this form with a function of . For the same&#10;modified theories the author in found corrections to , using the Wald&#10;method. The terms appearing in such modifications are evaluated at the&#10;(Killing) horizon of the black hole. Remember that in Verlinde’s&#10;derivation of Newton’s law, this horizon is the area of the holographic&#10;sphere, which in this article is the sphere with the Michell-Laplace&#10;radius. The Newtonian force, as well as the potential, are local&#10;quantities evaluated on this sphere, that is, at the horizon in&#10;Verlinde’s approach.&#10;&#10;[**Acknowledgments**]{} We’d like to thank M.
