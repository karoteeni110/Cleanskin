    <title>**Quantum communication with photons**</title>
    <abstract>The secure communication of information plays an ever increasing role in
our society today. Classical methods of encryption inherently rely on
the difficulty of solving a problem such as finding prime factors of
large numbers and can, in principle, be cracked by a fast enough
machine. The burgeoning field of quantum communication relies on the
fundamental laws of physics to offer unconditional information security.
Here we introduce the key concepts of quantum superposition and
entanglement as well as the no-cloning theorem that form the basis of
this field. Then, we review basic quantum communication schemes with
single and entangled photons and discuss recent experimental progress in
ground and space-based quantum communication. Finally, we discuss the
emerging field of high-dimensional quantum communication, which promises
increased data rates and higher levels of security than ever before. We
discuss recent experiments that use the orbital angular momentum of
photons for sharing large amounts of information in a secure fashion. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Ever since its inception, quantum physics has changed our understanding&#10;of the fundamental principles of nature. Apart from their impact on all&#10;fields of academic research, these insights have merged together with&#10;the field of information science to create the novel field of quantum&#10;information. Quantum information science provides qualitatively new&#10;concepts for communication, computation, and information processing,&#10;which are much more powerful than their classical counterparts. Quantum&#10;information is an intriguing example where purely fundamental and even&#10;philosophical research can lead to new technologies. The developments in&#10;this young field recently experienced a worldwide boom—as is evidenced&#10;by the increasing number of quantum information centers being founded in&#10;countries all over the world. Although its long-term industrial&#10;applications cannot be clearly anticipated, it is clear that quantum&#10;information science entails a huge potential economic impact. For&#10;reasons of space we limit ourselves to polarisation and orbital angular&#10;momentum (OAM) as information carrying degrees of freedom.">
  <outline text="The Quantum Bit" _note="In classical information and computation science, information is encoded&#10;in the most fundamental entity, the bit. Its two possible values **0**&#10;and **1** are physically realized in many ways, be it simply by&#10;mechanical means (as a switch), in solids by magnetic or ferroelectric&#10;domains (hard drives), or by light pulses (optical digital media). All&#10;of these methods have one thing in common—one state of the device&#10;mutually excludes the simultaneous presence of the other—the switch is&#10;either **on** or **off**.&#10;&#10;The superposition principle entails one of the most fundamental aspects&#10;of quantum physics, namely to allow the description of a physical system&#10;as being in a probabilistic combination of its alternative states. This&#10;so-called SUPERPOSITION OF STATES not only provides all predictions for&#10;the outcome of a physical measurement, it also has drastic consequences&#10;for the nature of the physical state that we ascribe to a system. Its&#10;most important direct implication is the so-called NO-CLONING THEOREM,&#10;which states that it is impossible to obtain a perfect copy of a qubit&#10;in an unknown state without destroying the information content of the&#10;original. The no-cloning theorem is the basis for the security of all&#10;quantum communication schemes described in the following sections, and&#10;will be explained later in more detail.&#10;&#10;A qubit can be realized in many different physical systems such as&#10;atoms, ions, and super-conducting circuits. The most prominent physical&#10;realization of a qubit in view of a potential global-scale quantum&#10;communication network is with photons. Using photons, the two values of&#10;a bit, **0** and **1**, can be encoded in many different ways. One&#10;possibility is to use two orthogonal polarisation states of a single&#10;photon, referred to as a polarisation qubit. In the latter case, one can&#10;ascribe the horizontal polarisation state of the photon with the logical&#10;value **0** and the vertical polarisation state with the value of **1**.&#10;Any arbitrary polarisation state can be obtained via a superposition of&#10;the horizontal and vertical state. The advantage of using photonic&#10;polarisation qubits is that they can be easily generated, controlled,&#10;and manipulated with rather simple linear optical devices like wave&#10;plates. Furthermore, since photons rarely exhibit interaction with the&#10;environment they are the best candidates for long-distance free-space&#10;transmission as would be required in a future network involving&#10;ground-to-space links.&#10;&#10;To fully understand a qubit, it is important to distinguish between a&#10;coherent superposition and a mixture of possible states. For its use in&#10;quantum communication, it is important that a photon exists in a&#10;coherent superposition of its possible states. For example, a&#10;polarisation qubit being in a coherent superposition of horizontal and&#10;vertical polarisations (with a certain phase relation) can be understood&#10;as a photon polarised diagonally at . A polarizer set at this angle will&#10;always transmit such a photon with 100% probability (and zero&#10;probability when set to ). However, a photon in a mixture (incoherent&#10;superposition) of horizontal and vertical polarisation states will be&#10;transmitted with 50% probability.&#10;&#10;Quantum superpositions, however, are not limited to just two possible&#10;states. The information carried by a photon is potentially enormous.&#10;While polarisation is necessarily a two-level (qubit) property, other&#10;degrees of freedom of a photon such as its spatial or temporal structure&#10;can have many orthogonal levels. For example, a photon can exist in a&#10;coherent superposition of different paths coming out of a multi-port&#10;beam splitter. These types of superpositions are referred to as&#10;“high-dimensional&quot; by virtue of their ability to encode large amounts of&#10;information. Consider a photon that is carrying a complicated image,&#10;such as that shown in Figure \[fig:HigherModes\]. This image can be&#10;decomposed in terms of any orthonormal basis of spatial modes. The&#10;number of modes required for a complete description of this image&#10;dictate the number of levels, or dimensionality of this photon. One such&#10;basis is the set of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, which are described by a&#10;photon carrying a twisted wavefront. The phase structure of such a&#10;photon winds from 0 to azimuthally around the optical axis, with the&#10;number of twists dictating the photon state dimensionality. Using such&#10;high-dimensional degrees of freedom of a photon for encoding surely&#10;increases the amount of information one can send per photon. However, a&#10;more subtle advantage of doing this is found in quantum&#10;communication—not only can one vastly increase the information capacity&#10;of quantum communication systems, one can also increase their security.&#10;This point is discussed in detail later in this chapter.\&#10;">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Entanglement" _note="The principle of superposition also holds for states containing several&#10;qubits. This allows for multi-qubit systems, which can only be described&#10;by joint properties. Such states are called ENTANGLED, describing the&#10;fact that none of the particles involved can be described by an&#10;individual quantum state . This is equivalent to the astonishing&#10;property of entangled quantum systems, that all of their information&#10;content is completely entailed in the correlations between the&#10;individual subsystems and none of the subsystems carry any information&#10;on their own. For example, when performing measurements on only one of&#10;two entangled qubits, the outcome will be perfectly random, i.e., it is&#10;impossible to obtain information about the entangled system. However,&#10;since the entangled state consists of two qubits, the correlations&#10;shared between them must consist of two bits of classical information.&#10;As a consequence, these two bits of information can only be obtained&#10;when the outcomes of the individual measurements on the separate&#10;subsystems are compared (see Figure \[fig:entanglement\]).&#10;&#10;Another intriguing feature of of entangled states is that a measurement&#10;on one of the entangled qubits instantaneously projects the other one&#10;onto the corresponding perfectly correlated state, thereby destroying&#10;the entanglement. Since these perfect correlations between entangled&#10;qubits are in theory independent of the distance between them, the&#10;entanglement is in conflict with the fundamental concepts of classical&#10;physics—locality (i.e. distant events cannot interact faster than the&#10;speed of light) and realism (i.e. each physical quantity that can be&#10;predicted with certainty corresponds to an ontological entity, a&#10;so-called “element of reality&quot;) . This has led to various philosophical&#10;debates about whether quantum mechanics can serve as a complete&#10;description of reality. However, there have been many experiments&#10;performed addressing this issue, and to date each of them has confirmed&#10;the predictions of quantum mechanics . One should note that while here&#10;we focus on polarisation and orbital-angular momentum entanglement,&#10;light can be entangled in its other degrees of freedom as well, such as&#10;time-frequency and position-momentum .&#10;&#10;">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Mutually Unbiased Bases" _note="One fascinating concept in quantum mechanics is the possibility to&#10;encode quantum information in different ways. In the simple example of&#10;the polarisation of light, there are three bases in which one can encode&#10;one bit of information (see Figure \[fig:MUBs\]). These are the&#10;horizontal and vertical (H/V) basis, the diagonal and anti-diagonal&#10;(D/A) basis, and the left- and right-circular (L/R) basis. One can&#10;encode a bit in the H/V basis by considering 0 to be horizontal&#10;polarisation and 1 to be vertical polarisation. If a photon encoded in&#10;either H or V polarisation is measured in any of the other two bases,&#10;its information cannot be extracted. For example, in the case of&#10;measurements made in the D/A basis, in 50% of the cases, a diagonally&#10;polarised photon will be observed; in the other cases the photon will be&#10;measured as anti-diagonally polarised. This property is the main&#10;ingredient for quantum cryptography, as we will see later. Furthermore,&#10;in higher-dimensional systems, fundamental properties of mutually&#10;unbiased bases are still open questions that are significant for quantum&#10;communication.&#10;&#10;">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Faster-than-light communication and the No-Cloning Theorem" _note="As discussed above, two entangled photons are connected even though they&#10;can be spatially separated by hundreds of kilometers. The measurement of&#10;the first photon immediately defines the state of the second photon. Can&#10;one use that to transmit information faster than the speed of light? If&#10;Alice and Bob share an entangled state and measure their respective&#10;photon in the same mutually unbiased basis (for instance, in the&#10;horizontal/vertical basis), they will always find the same result.&#10;However, whether they detect a horizontal or vertical photon is&#10;intrinsically random—there is no way that Alice could influence the&#10;outcome of Bob. Regardless, there could exist a workaround, as shown in&#10;Figure \[fig:clone\]. Alice could use her choice of measurement basis to&#10;convey information: either horizontal/vertical (H/V) if she wants to&#10;transmit 0 or diagonal/antidiagonal (D/A) if she wants to send 1. When&#10;she does this, Bob’s photon is immediately defined in that specific&#10;basis. If Bob could now clone his photon, he could make several&#10;measurements in both bases and find out in which of the two bases his&#10;photon is well defined: If Alice measured in the H/V basis and finds an&#10;H outcome, all of Bob’s measurements in the H/V basis will be H.&#10;However, his measurements in the D/A basis will show 50% diagonal and&#10;50% antidiagonal. Thus, he knows that Alice has chosen the H/V basis,&#10;and thereby transmitted the bit value 0.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, there is one problem with that protocol: It cannot exist.&#10;In 1982, Wootters and Zurek found that quantum mechanics forbids one to&#10;perfectly clone a quantum state . This profound result originates from a&#10;simple property of quantum mechanics, namely the linear superposition&#10;principle. We can inspect what a potential cloning-operation would do.&#10;We use an input quantum state, and an undefined second photon . After&#10;the cloning operation, the second photon should have the polarisation&#10;property of the first photon. This is how our cloning machine would act&#10;on states in the H/V-basis:&#10;&#10;The cloning-machine should work in every basis, thus we inspect what&#10;happens when we try to clone a diagonally polarised photon . Note that a&#10;diagonally polarised photon can be expressed in the H/V basis as a&#10;coherent superposition of a horizontal and a vertical part . The quantum&#10;cloning machine acts as&#10;&#10;The last line in equation (3) was obtained by using equations (1) and&#10;(2) for the cloning operator . The result is an entangled state that&#10;cannot be factorised into . If one were to measure either of the&#10;entangled photons individually, the result would be random, and&#10;certainly not . From this simple example it is clear that quantum&#10;cloning is not possible. This property prohibits faster-than-light&#10;communication, but it opens the door to many different quantum secret&#10;sharing protocols, such as quantum cryptography.">

  <outline text="Quantum Communication Schemes" _note="The counterintuitive quantum principles of superposition and&#10;entanglement are not only the basis of acquiring a deeper understanding&#10;of nature, but also enable new technologies that allow one to perform&#10;tasks which are not possible by classical means. When speaking about&#10;such “quantum technologies&quot;, we refer to technologies that make explicit&#10;use of these kinds of quantum properties that do not have a classical&#10;analog. Quantum information science and quantum communication are&#10;important ingredients in future quantum information processing&#10;technologies. They enable the transfer of a quantum state from one&#10;location to another. All quantum communication schemes have in common&#10;that two or more parties are connected via both a classical&#10;communication channel and a quantum channel (i.e. a channel over which&#10;quantum systems are transmitted). Typically, measurements are performed&#10;on the individual quantum (sub-) systems and the measurement bases used&#10;for every measurement are communicated via the classical channel. Here,&#10;we focus on quantum communication with discrete variables. However, we&#10;should mention that there exists a parallel branch of quantum&#10;communication that is based on continuous variables, where extensive&#10;theoretical and experimental work has been performed. More information&#10;on this field can be found in and references therein.&#10;&#10;">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Quantum Key Distribution" _note="If two parties want to share a secret message, they have two options:&#10;the first possibility is to share a random key that is the size of the&#10;message that needs to be encrypted with it (shown in Figure&#10;\[fig:symmCrypt\]). The sender, let’s call her Alice, performs a simple&#10;logical operator (an EXCLUSIVE OR, XOR) of the message with the key, and&#10;gets the cipher. The cipher can only be read if the key is known. The&#10;receiver of the encrypted text, whom we will call Bob, can use the key&#10;to undo Alice’s operation, which gives him the original message. The&#10;challenge lies in Alice and Bob having to share the entire secret key.&#10;&#10;The alternative is a public-private key cryptography. This method,&#10;invented in the 1970s, is based on the computational complexity of&#10;finding the prime factors of large numbers. Again, Alice wants to send a&#10;secret message to Bob. Now Bob creates a pair of keys, a private and a&#10;public one. Everybody who has Bob’s public key can encrypt messages for&#10;him. However, only Bob can decrypt those messages with his private key.&#10;However, it has been discovered by Peter Shor in 1994 that a quantum&#10;computer could factor prime numbers significantly faster than classical&#10;computers. It would allow an eavesdropper to read the secret message&#10;with only the information that is distributed publicly (see Figure&#10;\[fig:asymmCrypt\]). One possible way to circumvent this problem is&#10;quantum key distribution.&#10;&#10;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) allows two authorized parties to&#10;establish a secret key at a distance. The generation of this secret key&#10;is based on the same quantum physical principles that a quantum computer&#10;relies on. In contrast to classical cryptography, QKD does not simply&#10;rely on the difficulty of solving a mathematical problem (such as&#10;finding the prime powers of a large number). Therefore, even a quantum&#10;computer could not break the key. QKD consists of two phases (see Figure&#10;\[fig:qkdcrypt\]. In the first phase the two communicating parties,&#10;usually called Alice and Bob, exchange quantum signals over the quantum&#10;channel and perform measurements, obtaining a raw key (i.e., two&#10;strongly correlated but non-identical and only partly secret strings).&#10;In the second phase, Alice and Bob use the classical channel to perform&#10;an interactive post-processing protocol, which allows them to distill&#10;two identical and completely secret (known only to themselves) strings,&#10;which are two identical copies of the generated secret key. The&#10;classical channel in this protocol needs to be authenticated: this means&#10;that Alice and Bob identify themselves; a third person can listen to the&#10;conversation but cannot participate in it. The quantum channel, however,&#10;is open to any possible manipulation from a third person. Specifically,&#10;the task of Alice and Bob is to guarantee security against an&#10;adversarial eavesdropper, usually called Eve, tapping on the quantum&#10;channel and listening to the exchanges on the classical channel.&#10;&#10;In this context security explicitly means that a non-secret key is never&#10;used: either the authorized parties can indeed create a secret key, or&#10;they abort the protocol. Therefore, after the transmission of the&#10;quantum signals, Alice and Bob must estimate how much information about&#10;raw keys has leaked out to Eve. Such an estimate is obviously impossible&#10;in classical communication: if someone is tapping on a telephone line,&#10;or when Eve listens to the exchanges on the classical channel, the&#10;communication goes on unmodified. This is where quantum physics plays a&#10;crucial role: in a quantum channel, leakage of information is&#10;quantitatively related to a degradation of the communication. The origin&#10;of security of QKD can be traced back to the fundamental quantum&#10;physical principles of superposition and no-cloning. If Eve wants to&#10;extract some information from the quantum states, this is a generalized&#10;form of measurement, which will usually modify the state of the system.&#10;Alternatively, if Eve’s goal is to have a perfect copy of the state that&#10;Alice sends to Bob, she will fail due to the no-cloning theorem, which&#10;states that one cannot duplicate an unknown quantum state while keeping&#10;the original intact. In summary, the fact that security can be based on&#10;general principles of physics allows for unconditional security, i.e.&#10;the possibility of guaranteeing security without imposing any&#10;restriction on the power of the eavesdropper.&#10;&#10;The first Quantum Cryptography scheme was published by Bennett and&#10;Brassard in 1984 and is known today as the BB84 protocol. It requires&#10;four different qubit states that form two complementary bases (i.e. if&#10;the result of a measurement can be predicted with certainty in one of&#10;the two bases, it is completely undetermined in the other). These states&#10;are usually realized with four linear polarisation states of a photon&#10;forming two complimentary bases, for e.g. horizontal (H), vertical (V),&#10;diagonal (D) and anti-diagonal (A). As illustrated in Figure&#10;\[fig:bb84\_protocol\], Alice sends single photons to Bob, which were&#10;prepared randomly in any of the four polarisation states and records the&#10;state of any sent photon. Bob receives and analyzes them with a&#10;two-channel analyzer, again randomly in one of the two complementary&#10;bases H/V or D/A. He records his measurement results together with the&#10;corresponding measurement basis. After enough photons have been&#10;transmitted, Bob communicates publicly with Alice and tells her which&#10;photons actually arrived and in which basis it was measured, but does&#10;not reveal the measurement result. In return, Alice tells Bob when she&#10;has used the same bases to prepare them, because only in these cases Bob&#10;obtains the correct result. Assigning the binary value **0** to H and D&#10;and the value **1** to V and A, leaves Alice and Bob with an identical&#10;set of **0**s and **1**s. This set is called the sifted key.&#10;&#10;The security of the key distribution is based on the fact that a&#10;measurement of an unknown quantum system will (in most cases) disturb&#10;the system: If Alice’s and Bob’s sifted keys are perfectly correlated&#10;(which can be proven by comparing a small subset of the whole sifted key&#10;via classical communication), no eavesdropper tried to listen to the&#10;transmission and the key can be used for encoding a confidential message&#10;using the one-time pad (i.e., a specific key is exactly as long as the&#10;message to be encrypted and this key is only used once). In practical&#10;systems, however, there will always be some inherent noise due to dark&#10;counts in the detectors and transmission errors. As it cannot be&#10;distinguished whether the errors in the sifted key come from noise in&#10;the quantum channel or from eavesdropping activity, they all must be&#10;attributed to an eavesdropping attack. If the error is below a certain&#10;threshold Alice and Bob can still distill a final secret key using&#10;classical protocols for error correction and privacy amplification. If&#10;the error is above the threshold, the key is discarded and a new&#10;distribution has to be started.&#10;&#10;In contrast to the SINGLE-PHOTON protocols described above, entanglement&#10;based QKD uses entangled photon pairs to establish the secure key . Lets&#10;assume that Alice and Bob share a polarisation entangled two-photon&#10;state. Due to the perfect polarisation correlations between entangled&#10;photons, Alice and Bob will always obtain the same result, when they&#10;measure the polarisation state of their photon in the same measurement&#10;basis. Since both measure randomly in one of two complementary bases&#10;(just as in the BB84 protocol), they have to publicly communicate after&#10;they have finished their measurements, which photons they actually&#10;detected and in which basis it was measured. Again, they discard those&#10;results in which they disagreed in the measurement basis and finally end&#10;up with an identical set of **0**s and **1**s - the sifted key. Just as&#10;in the BB84 protocol, Alice and Bob authenticate their keys by openly&#10;comparing (via classical communication) a small subset of their keys and&#10;evaluating the bit error rate.&#10;&#10;There are two big advantages in using entangled photons for implementing&#10;the QKD protocol. First, the randomness of the individual measurement&#10;results is intrinsic to the entangled state and therefore the randomness&#10;of the final key is ascertained. Second, an eavesdropper cannot mimic an&#10;entangled state by sending single photons in correlated polarisation&#10;states simultaneously to Alice and Bob. Hence, when using a subset of&#10;the transmitted photon pairs to examine the entanglement between them,&#10;secure communication is possible even though the operator of the&#10;entangled photon source might not be trustworthy.">

  <outline text="Quantum Teleportation" _note="Quantum teleportation is a process by which the state of a quantum&#10;system is transferred onto another distant quantum system without ever&#10;existing at any location in between . In contrast to what is often&#10;wrongly stated, this does not even in principle allow for&#10;faster-than-light communication or transport of matter. This becomes&#10;clearer when considering the entire three-step protocol of quantum&#10;teleportation (an illustration is shown in Figure&#10;\[fig:teleport\_scheme\]).&#10;&#10;First, it is necessary that Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver)&#10;share a pair of entangled qubits (qubits 2 and 3 in the figure). Next,&#10;Alice is provided with a third qubit (qubit 1), the state of which she&#10;wants to teleport and which is unknown to her. In the last step, Alice&#10;destroys any information about the state of qubit 1 by performing a&#10;so-called Bell-state measurement (BSM) between qubits 1 and 2. As a&#10;consequence of this measurement and due to the initial entanglement&#10;between qubit 2 and 3, qubit 3 is instantaneously projected onto the&#10;same state as qubit 1. However, the teleportation protocol only works in&#10;cases, where the BSM resulted in exactly one out of four possible random&#10;outcomes. As a consequence, Bob needs to be notified by Alice about the&#10;outcome of the BSM in order to being able to identify the successful&#10;teleportation events. This requires classical communication between&#10;Alice and Bob and essentially limits the speed of information transfer&#10;within the teleportation protocol to the speed of the classical&#10;communication channel.&#10;&#10;Quantum teleportation is an essential prerequisite for a so-called&#10;quantum repeater. A quantum repeater will be an important building block&#10;in a future network, since it allows to interconnect different network&#10;nodes. In a quantum repeater, two particles of independent entangled&#10;pairs are combined within a BSM, such that the entanglement is relayed&#10;onto the remaining two particles. This process is called entanglement&#10;swapping and will eventually allow to overcome any distance limitations&#10;in a global-scale network. However, in order to efficiently execute&#10;entanglement swapping, it has to be supplemented with an entanglement&#10;purification step requiring quantum memories.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Long distance quantum communication">
  <outline text="Ground-based long-distance experiments" _note="Quantum physics was invented to describe nature at the microscopic level&#10;of atoms and light. It remains an open question to what extent these&#10;laws are applicable in the macroscopic domain. In this respect, numerous&#10;ongoing research efforts pursue the goal of extending the distance&#10;between entangled quantum systems. They aim at investigating whether&#10;there are any possible fundamental limitations to quantum entanglement&#10;and if it is feasible to establish a global-scale quantum communication&#10;network in the future. In the past years, several free-space quantum&#10;communication experiments have been performed by several groups over&#10;various distances , studying the feasibility of different quantum&#10;communication protocols over large distances. Starting with fairly short&#10;free-space links in the order of a few kilometers, the range was quickly&#10;extended up to today’s world-record distance of 144 km, held by the&#10;authors of this article.&#10;&#10;One of the first experiments using a 144 km free-space link between the&#10;Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife was performed by Ursin ET AL. in&#10;2007 . In this experiment (see Figure \[fig:Fig\_Canary05\]), a source&#10;of entangled photon pairs was installed in La Palma at the top of the&#10;vulcano mountain Roque de los Muchachos at an altitude of 2400m.&#10;&#10;One of the photons of an entangled pair was detected locally, while the&#10;other photon was sent to Tenerife. There, the optical ground station&#10;(OGS) of the European Space Agency (ESA), located at the Observatory del&#10;Teide at an altitude of 2400m, was used as the receiving telescope for&#10;the photons coming from La Palma. After analyzing the polarisation&#10;correlations between the associated photons on both islands, the&#10;scientists could verify that the photons are still entangled even though&#10;they have been separated by 144km. Additionally, the same group&#10;implemented quantum key distribution protocols based on both entangled&#10;as well as single photons . On the one hand, the results of these&#10;experiments addressed a question of fundamental physical interest, that&#10;entanglement can survive global-scale separations between the entangled&#10;particles. On the other hand, it verified that the OGS in Tenerife,&#10;which was originally built for laser communication with satellites, is&#10;also suitable to faithfully receive entangled photons. In combination,&#10;these results demonstrate the general feasibility for potential future&#10;space-based quantum communication experiments, thus setting the&#10;cornerstone for fundamental physical research as well as for potential&#10;applications of quantum mechanical principles in future network&#10;scenarios.&#10;&#10;The achievements of these experiments were based on a combination of&#10;advanced techniques, laying the cornerstone for the Austrian researchers&#10;for a whole range of continuative activities employing the same&#10;free-space link between La Palma and Tenerife. In 2008, Fedrizzi ET AL.&#10;generated entangled photon pairs in La Palma and sent both photons to&#10;Tenerife. The authors could verify entanglement between the photons&#10;detected in Tenerife and also implemented an entanglement based QKD&#10;protocol. This experiment was an important step towards a potential&#10;future quantum communication network, because with respect to the&#10;transmission loss, their experimental configuration was equivalent to a&#10;basic future network scenario, where entangled pairs are transmitted&#10;from a satellite to two separate receiving stations on ground&#10;&#10;The long-distance experiments of our group so far involved only two&#10;photons. However, quantum communication protocols like teleportation or&#10;entanglement swapping, as described earlier, require more than two&#10;photons and will be of utmost important in a future network. Its&#10;experimental implementation, however, is substantially more complex than&#10;the two-photon protocols, necessitating a step back regarding the&#10;communication distance.&#10;&#10;In 2010, a group of Chinese researcher were the first to report on a&#10;long-distance free-space quantum teleportation experiment ,&#10;demonstrating this protocol outside the shielded laboratory environment.&#10;They implemented a variant of the teleportation scheme described earlier&#10;and teleported the quantum states of photons over a distance of 16km.&#10;This achievement triggered a race between the Austrian and Chinese&#10;groups to push the distance record for teleportation even further. It&#10;lasted until 2012 that the Chinese group reported on a successful&#10;demonstration of quantum teleportation over a 97km free-space link&#10;across the Qinghai lake . But it was only 8 days later that also the&#10;Austrian group with the results of their work on long-distance quantum&#10;teleportation between La Palma and Tenerife, reporting a new distance&#10;record of 143 km .&#10;&#10;The communication distances spanned in these experiments was in fact&#10;more challenging than expected for a satellite-to-ground link and thus&#10;the results of both groups proof the feasibility of quantum repeaters in&#10;a future space- and ground-based worldwide quantum internet. Together&#10;with a reliable quantum memory, these results set the benchmark for an&#10;efficient quantum repeater at the heart of a global&#10;quantum-communication network.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Space-based quantum communication" _note="The experiments described above represent the state-of-the-art of&#10;long-distance quantum communication. Significantly longer distances are&#10;no longer possible on ground, since the curvature of the earth will then&#10;prevent direct line of sight links. The logical next step is to bring&#10;quantum technology into space and several international research&#10;initiatives in Europe, Singapore, China, USA, and Canada are currently&#10;pursuing related projects.&#10;&#10;It is a clear vision of the science community to establish a worldwide&#10;quantum communication network with all the advantages over it’s&#10;classical counterpart described above. That requires significantly&#10;expanding the distances for distributing quantum systems beyond the&#10;capabilities of terrestrial experiments and can only be realized by&#10;tackling the additional challenge of bringing the concepts and&#10;technologies of quantum physics to a space environment. Long-distance&#10;quantum communication experiments have been underway for some time&#10;sending single photons through long optical fibers. The first scientific&#10;demonstration, still in the shielded laboratory, where conducted in the&#10;late 1990ties. The question to be answered at that time was, if the&#10;peculiar and fragile laboratory experiments can also be executed facing&#10;harsh real-world environmental conditions as are present in optical&#10;telecommunication networks.&#10;&#10;There are limitations for high-speed quantum communication in optical&#10;fibers. For example, the maximum speed of generating, preparing and&#10;detecting single photons is on the order of a few Mbit per second using&#10;state-of-the-art high speed electronics. Due to the combination of noise&#10;in real detector-devices and transmission loss in the optical fiber, the&#10;distance, over which quantum information can be communicated is&#10;restricted to a few 100 km . Hence, for bridging distances on a global&#10;scale using optical fiber networks, the implementation of so-called&#10;quantum repeaters is paramout. Quantum repeaters are the quantum analog&#10;to classical optical amplifiers making global fibre communication as of&#10;today yet feasible. Quantum repeaters are a theoretical concept proposed&#10;in 1998 and require as basic building blocks the concepts of quantum&#10;teleportation and quantum memories. Specifically, the combination of&#10;both is highly complex from a technological point of view, such that the&#10;development of a quantum repeater is yet in the early stages. The second&#10;solution to bridge distances on a global scale is to use&#10;satellite-to-earth and inter-satellite optical free-space connections .&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:network\] depicts a typical space-mission scenario for the&#10;distribution of entanglement from a transmitter terminal to two receiver&#10;stations (Alice and Bob). The quantum source installed on the&#10;transmitter emits pairs of photons in a desired entangled state. The&#10;photon pairs exhibit strong correlations in time, and entanglement in&#10;the degree of freedom in which the quantum information is encoded. The&#10;single photons comprising each of these entangled pairs are sent to&#10;Alice and Bob via free-space communications links (quantum links)&#10;established between the satellites or satellites and an optical ground&#10;station. The photons are collected via telescopes at the receiver&#10;terminals, where Alice and Bob each perform quantum measurements on&#10;their respective photons. Before initializing the transfer of&#10;information, the transmitter must establish a separate standard&#10;communications channel with Alice and Bob. This classical communications&#10;channel is subsequently used to send information about which basis state&#10;the measurements were performed on a given pair. The detection time of&#10;every arriving photon is recorded using fast single-photon detectors,&#10;and detection events that comprise an entangled pair are identified by&#10;means of their temporal correlations. The identification of photon pairs&#10;by their detection times requires the transmitter and receiver modules&#10;to establish and maintain a synchronized time basis, which can be&#10;achieved using an external reference, or autonomously via the classical&#10;communications link. Once the pair-detection events have been&#10;identified, Alice and Bob can reveal their stronger-than-classical&#10;correlations by communicating the bases of the quantum measurements&#10;performed on each photon pair via the classical communications channel.&#10;&#10;Distributing entangled photon pairs over long-distance links and&#10;revealing their quantum correlations is an immensely challenging task&#10;from a technological point of view, in particular due to the fact that,&#10;as a result of unavoidable losses in the quantum link, only a fraction&#10;of the photons emitted by the transmitter actually arrive at the&#10;receiver modules. The main sources contributing to losses along the&#10;optical transmission channel are atmospheric absorption and scattering,&#10;on the one hand, and diffraction, telescope pointing errors, and&#10;atmospheric turbulence, which all lead to beam broadening and thus limit&#10;the fraction of photons collected by the receiver aperture, on the&#10;other. Typical losses in such scenarios are in the order of -30 to -40&#10;dB.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, in order to achieve feasible pair-detection rates at such&#10;huge link losses requires a very bright source of entangled photon pairs&#10;as well as minimizing losses in the transmission channel and the&#10;receivers. Note that, since correlated photon pairs are identified by&#10;their arrival times, there is an upper limit to how effective the photon&#10;production rate can mitigate against link loss. Once the time between&#10;two successive pair emissions at the source decreases below the timing&#10;jitter of the detectors, these two successive photons can no longer be&#10;distinguished from each other, such that as a result the quantum bit&#10;error ratio (QBER) will be increased.&#10;&#10;The pairs detected by the two terminals will ultimately comprise of&#10;photons steaming from the entangled photons source (the signal) but also&#10;from unavoidable sources of uncorrelated background photons (the noise).&#10;The background is from stray light the detector might see and the&#10;intrinsic dark counts of the photon avalanche detectors in use. The&#10;background can be mitigated to a certain extent bu using very&#10;narrow-band filters, allowing only those photons to be guided to the&#10;detector, who are at the wavelength of the quantum source in use. Also&#10;the common timing of the entangled photons are useful to mitigate noise&#10;pair counts.&#10;&#10;Entangled photon sources maintaining both their high brightness and the&#10;quality of the emitted quantum state will have to be manufactured in a&#10;very reliable and stable manner to survive the launch of the satellite&#10;as well as the harsh space environment (radiation). First research and&#10;development projects funded by the European Space Agency were dedicated&#10;to the non-linear periodically poled Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (ppKTP)&#10;crystal, which is used in state-of-the-art entangled photon sources.&#10;Additionally, the implementation of the rather complex structure of&#10;lenses and beam-splitters is addressed in these studies and radiation&#10;effects on single photon detectors have already been investigated in&#10;detail . These first attempts do show, that a quantum mission based on&#10;state-of-the-art technology is feasibly and requires the integration&#10;into commercially available space-laser terminals as a next step.&#10;&#10;As outlined above, quantum communication provides a novel way of&#10;information transfer. Even though it is still under development, it has&#10;the potential to become our future technology for communication and&#10;computation. First proposed experiments in space will serve as a very&#10;good platform to test these concepts and could pave the way for follow&#10;up industrial systems. On a very long term perspective it is highly&#10;interesting to test quantum mechanics at distances on the order of&#10;millions of km, and even beyond. Furthermore, an ultimate experiment&#10;regarding the role of randomness and humans free-will could be performed&#10;by two individuals, separated by at least one light second, who each&#10;measure entangled particles and separately choose the setting of their&#10;analyzer. To extend the scale of quantum mechanical states over&#10;astronomical distances might provide us with a suitable insight on the&#10;link between gravitation, quantum mechanics and even more. Clearly,&#10;these experiments require advances in technology not even foreseeable&#10;today. Nevertheless, the proposed experiments are a major step in&#10;investigating these fundamental questions as well as enhancing the&#10;technology for the society’s benefit.">

<outline text="Higher Dimensions" _note="So far, we have focused only on qubits, which are quantum mechanical&#10;two-level systems. This is a natural choice, as all of our classical&#10;data storage, transmission, and processing is based on classical&#10;two-level systems that encode zeros and ones. There are only a very few&#10;exotic exceptions, such as the SETUN computer build in Soviet union in&#10;the late 1950s, which used trinary logic.&#10;&#10;However, if one were to look at nature’s way of encoding and processing&#10;information, one would be surprised to find that it uses a higher-level&#10;system: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) uses four types of nucleobase&#10;(Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine) to encode information. Three&#10;nucleobase together encode one amino acid, the basis of biological life.&#10;If nature—optimized over hundreds of million of years through&#10;evolution—uses a higher-level system for encoding information, we see no&#10;reason why one shouldn’t investigate its use in quantum information as&#10;well!&#10;&#10;There are two types of high-dimensional systems that depend on whether&#10;one considers discrete or continuous parameters. An example of a&#10;continuous degree-of-freedom (DoF) is the position (or likewise, the&#10;momentum) of a photon. Quantum correlations in this DoF have been used&#10;for interesting new types of imaging schemes such as quantum ghost&#10;imaging, where the image of the object can only be seen in the&#10;correlations of the photons . A different, even more counterintuitive&#10;quantum imaging procedure was recently demonstrated where an object was&#10;imaged without ever detecting the photons which were in contact with the&#10;imaged object .&#10;&#10;In some scenarios, a discrete basis is more advantageous. In classical&#10;communications or data storage, for example, information is encoded&#10;either as a 0 or a 1; fractional numbers in between are not used. The&#10;same is true for quantum communication or quantum computation, even with&#10;larger alphabets. A natural basis that uses a discrete DoF of a photon&#10;is its orbital angular momentum, which is presented in the next section.&#10;Other possible bases can be constructed by the discretisation of&#10;continuous parameters such as position or wavelength.">
  <outline text="Twisted Photons" _note="If one investigates the spatial profile of a laser beam with a camera,&#10;one usually finds that it has a Gaussian shape. However, that is only a&#10;special case of a much more complex family of fundamental spatial&#10;structures, or modes. One very convenient set of modes are the so-called&#10;Laguerre-Gaussian modes . In Figure \[fig:OAMint\], the intensity and&#10;phase structure of a Gaussian mode () compared to Laguerre-Gaussian&#10;modes () are shown.&#10;&#10;In contrast to its polarisation, which is a property related to its spin&#10;angular momentum, a photon with a Laguerre-Gaussian mode structure can&#10;also carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). The spin and orbital-angular&#10;momenta have distinct physical properties: if a laser beam with circular&#10;polarisation illuminates a small particle, the particle will start to&#10;rotate around its own axis. However, if a beam with orbital angular&#10;momentum shines on a particle, it starts to rotate around the external&#10;orbit defined by the laser beam . Surprisingly, the OAM of photons and&#10;its connection to Laguerre-Gauss modes was identified only recently in&#10;1992 .&#10;&#10;Interestingly, the OAM quantum number of a photon can theoretically take&#10;on any integer number between and . This allows one to encode a huge&#10;amount of data onto a single photon . In classical communications, this&#10;can improve the data rates enormously. Recent experiments have&#10;demonstrated data transmission of 100 Tbit/sec by using the OAM of light&#10;together with other DoFs . In quantum communication, secret sharing&#10;protocols have been developed that use OAM modes as an alphabet for&#10;encoding . Not only do such protocols offer an increased data rate, they&#10;also provide an improved level of security against eavesdropping attacks&#10;.">

  <outline text="High-Dimensional Entanglement" _note="Earlier in this chapter, entanglement was explained in the context of&#10;photon polarisation, which is a two-level system. In such systems, the&#10;separated photon pair can share one bit of information in a non-local&#10;manner, referred to as an entangled bit or “ebit&quot;.&#10;&#10;However, if we consider larger dimensional systems such as the OAM of&#10;photons, one can easily imagine that a pair of photons entangled in&#10;their OAM could share much more information than photons entangled in&#10;their polarisation. Such modes get bigger in size as the OAM quantum&#10;number is increased. Thus, the amount of information carried by them is&#10;only limited by the size of the optical devices used, or more generally,&#10;by the size of the universe itself! A natural question that arises is&#10;whether there exists a limit to the amount of information that can be&#10;non-locally shared between two entangled photon pairs. This question is&#10;being investigated in several laboratories around the world . These&#10;efforts have confirmed that two distant photons can be entangled in&#10;hundred and more dimensions of their spatial mode structure. This means&#10;that by measuring the first photon of the entangled pair, one will&#10;observe one definite result out of the hundred possible outcomes. This&#10;immediately tells us the outcome of a similar measurement on the second,&#10;distant photon. However, the strangeness lies in the fact that the two&#10;photons did not have a definite value before they were measured. Only&#10;when the first photon is observed does the common state become a&#10;reality, and the second photon gets a defined value.&#10;&#10;Photons entangled in their orbital angular momentum also enable the&#10;possibility to explore more complex types of entanglement that is not&#10;possible with two-dimensional entangled states. Recent state-of-the-art&#10;experiments have shown the entanglement of eight photons , nine&#10;superconducting circuits , and fourteen ions . However, these&#10;experiments have singularly focused on increasing the number of&#10;particles entangled, while remaining in a two-dimensional space for each&#10;particle. The OAM of light was recently used to create the first&#10;entangled state where both, the number of particles and the number of&#10;dimensions, was greater than two . This state involved three photons&#10;asymmetrically entangled in their OAM: two photons resided in a&#10;three-dimensional space, while one photon lived in two dimensions.&#10;Interestingly, this asymmetric structure only appears when one considers&#10;multi-particle entanglement in dimensions greater than two . Such states&#10;also enable a novel “layered&quot; quantum communication protocol. For&#10;example, if three parties were to share the state described above, all&#10;three would have access to one bit of secure information, allowing them&#10;to generate a secure random key for sharing information. However, part&#10;of the time, two of the parties would have access to another bit of&#10;secure information. This would allow them to share an additional layer&#10;of information unknown to the third party in the communication scheme.&#10;This protocol can be generalised to include multiple layers of&#10;information shared asymmetrically amongst many different parties.">

  <outline text="Mutually Unbiased Bases in high dimensions" _note="Earlier in this chapter we have learned that for 2-dimensional systems,&#10;three unbiased bases exist. For larger dimensions, one finds more of&#10;these unbiased bases: in 3 dimensions there are 4 bases, in 4 dimensions&#10;there are 5 bases. In fact, it is known that for every prime-power&#10;dimension (with d=), the number of MUBs is (d+1). That means, in&#10;dimension d, there are (d+1) different ways to encode information. Now&#10;there is one very surprising fact: If the dimension of the space is not&#10;a prime-power, it is not known how many MUBs there are. The first of&#10;those cases is dimension 23=6 . Numerical search has only found 3 MUBs,&#10;and it a conjecture that there are only 3 MUBs. It is fascinating&#10;because it means that in 5 dimensions, there are more ways to encode&#10;information in different ways than in 6 dimensions, even though&#10;intuitively one might think that a larger space allows for more ways to&#10;embed information in different ways. This is crucial for quantum&#10;communication, because the number of MUBs is directly connected to the&#10;robustness (against noise and eavesdropping-attacks) of the protocol.&#10;The more different ways of encoding the information, the more secure the&#10;system is.">

  <outline text="High-dimensional Quantum Key distribution" _note="Quantum cryptography based on photons carrying OAM is similar to the&#10;schemes developed for polarisation that are explained earlier in this&#10;chapter. High-dimensional analogs to the BB84 and Ekert QKD protocols&#10;have been developed that use OAM for encoding . Similar to&#10;polarisation-based QKD, OAM-based QKD requires measurements to be&#10;performed in mutually unbiased bases to guarantee security against&#10;eavesdropping. The earliest such protocol was demonstrated with photons&#10;entangled in three dimensions of their OAM (, and ) . The&#10;high-dimensionally entangled photon pairs were produced in a BBO crystal&#10;and sent to two separate stations, where basis transformations were&#10;randomly performed by two holograms mounted on moving motorised stages&#10;at each station. The photons were then probabilistically split into&#10;three paths where their OAM content was measured by three additional&#10;holograms. In this manner, a three-dimensional key was generated with an&#10;error rate of 10%. Security was verified by testing for the presence of&#10;entanglement via a high-dimensional Bell inequality.&#10;&#10;One of the challenges in using OAM modes for quantum communication is&#10;the ability to sort single photons carrying OAM. The QKD scheme&#10;described above used beam splitters and holograms to projectively&#10;measure the OAM content of the single photons. This resulted in a scheme&#10;that was photon-inefficient, i.e. only one out of every nine photons was&#10;actually used for communication. While techniques for efficiently&#10;sorting the OAM of single photons existed, they relied on cascaded&#10;Mach-Zehnder interferometers for sorting OAM modes . Thus, the use of&#10;such a device in a quantum communication scheme was impractical due to&#10;issues of complexity and stability. However, in 2010, the group of Miles&#10;Padgett developed a refractive device that could sort the OAM of a&#10;single photon . This device “unwrapped&quot; the helical wavefront of an OAM&#10;mode, transforming it into a plane wave with a tilted wavefront. The&#10;amount of tilt was proportional to the OAM quantum number , allowing&#10;these modes to be separated by a simple lens. This device provided a&#10;diffraction-limited sorting efficiency of 75%, which was improved to 93%&#10;by the addition of two additional holographic transformations .&#10;&#10;The development of this device allowed photon-efficient OAM-based&#10;quantum communication schemes to be realized in the laboratory.&#10;Recently, a BB84 protocol using a seven-dimensional OAM alphabet was&#10;performed which made heavy use of the OAM sorter discussed above .&#10;Additionally, a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) was used to generate&#10;OAM modes at a rate of 4 kHz, which is much faster than the rates&#10;attainable with spatial light modulators. The key was encoded in the OAM&#10;basis as well as the mutually unbiased of the so-called angular modes&#10;(ANG), as shown in Fig. \[fig:OAMQKD\](b). Using this scheme, Alice and&#10;Bob were able to communicate securely at a rate of 2.05 bits per sifted&#10;photon. Their generated key had an error rate of approximately 10%,&#10;which was below the bounds for security against coherent attacks in a&#10;seven-dimensional QKD link. This experiment served as a&#10;proof-of-principle demonstration of OAM-based QKD. Several technological&#10;improvements (discussed in Ref. ) will be required to take such a scheme&#10;into the real world.">

  <outline text="Large Quantum Number Entanglement" _note="Twisted photons not only allow access to a very large state space, but&#10;also give access to very high quantum numbers. Photons can carry of&#10;angular momentum, and can be arbitrarily large. Usually, quantum&#10;phenomena are only observed in the microscopic world. Here however, with&#10;twisted photons it is possible to create entanglement between photons&#10;that differ by a very large amount of angular momentum. Theoretically,&#10;there is no upper limit of the number of angular momentum, which would&#10;give rise to the possibility of entanglement of macroscopic values of&#10;angular momentum.&#10;&#10;With this method, it was possible to show that two photons with a&#10;difference of 600 can be entangled . If the first photon carries 300 of&#10;angular momentum, the second carried -300, and vice versa. While being&#10;entangled in an two-dimensional subspace, it was the largest quantum&#10;number difference achieved. In that experiment, a spatial light&#10;modulator has been used, which can be seen in Fig. \[fig:OAMholo\].&#10;Recently, using novel methods to encode very large angular momentum at&#10;single photons, it was able to show entanglement of photons with a&#10;quantum number difference of 10,000.&#10;&#10;An important question that needs to be answered is the definition of&#10;MACROSCOPIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM, and which phenomena might arise from that.&#10;For example, there are predictions that photons close to a black hole&#10;change their angular momentum . As black holes are purely general&#10;relativistic objects, and entanglement is a purely quantum mechanical&#10;phenomenon, a deeper investigation into of these effects will be&#10;exciting.">

  <outline text="Long-distance transmission of twisted photons" _note="In a quantum communication scenario, the encoded information needs to be&#10;distributed between two parties. Usually one would think that optical&#10;fibers are the ideal solutions. Unfortunately, the information in&#10;twisted photons is not conserved in propagation through conventional&#10;fibers: Different modes mix in fibers, therefor the output is different&#10;than the input. Although recent advances show that special fibers can be&#10;used to transmit the first higher-order OAM modes for more than one&#10;kilometer , and reach a classical communication rate in the order of&#10;Terabit, this technology is still in its infancy. Specifically, it&#10;hasn’t been used in the realm of quantum physics yet. An alternative&#10;method is the transmission through free-space. In the case of&#10;earth-to-satellite quantum communication, this is the only possibility&#10;in any case.&#10;&#10;If long-distance transmission is considered, immediately the influence&#10;of atmospheric turbulence has to be taken into account. Varying pressure&#10;and temperature influence the structure of twisted photons. The question&#10;is: How much? While many mathematical and lab-scale studies have been&#10;performed, experimental investigation of that question are rare. Only&#10;recently, the first classical and quantum communication experiments have&#10;been performed over free-space intra-city link of more than 1 kilometer&#10;distance. Those results show that quantum entanglement with twisted&#10;photons can be distributed over larger distances, and the quality can be&#10;improved with technology that is already implemented in lab-scale&#10;experiments . As such, it could be a reliable way to distribute&#10;high-dimensional entanglement in a future quantum network.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="The possibility to share secret messages is of utmost importance for our&#10;society. From simple things like sending emails which can’t be read by&#10;an eavesdropper to the transmission of highly sensitive information&#10;between governments that needs to be secure for decades—cryptography&#10;plays a key role in ensuring privacy, economic stability, and stable&#10;relations between countries worldwide.&#10;&#10;As we have seen, classical cryptographic systems are vulnerable to&#10;various types of eavesdropping attacks. The problem is that either the&#10;secret key needs to be transmitted over insecure channels, or (in a&#10;public-private cryptography system) the security relies on mathematical&#10;conjectures that specific properties are difficult to calculate.&#10;Furthermore, quantum computing algorithms can significantly reduce the&#10;required time to find solutions for such problems (finding prime factors&#10;of large numbers, or calculating a discrete logarithm). On top of all&#10;this, back-doors can be implemented into these algorithms such that they&#10;perform as expected, but the creator of the algorithm obtains additional&#10;information. Such attacks have been widely discussed in connection with&#10;a weak generator for pseudo random numbers certified by NIST .&#10;&#10;The need for overcoming these problems posed by classical asymmetric&#10;cryptographic systems has led to the development of a field called&#10;Post-Quantum-Cryptography. There, problems which are believed to be more&#10;difficult than factoring large numbers are used to prepare a public and&#10;private key. Such methods are not practically used yet because of&#10;performance issues and unclear results on their security. While there&#10;are no classical or quantum algorithms to solve such problems yet, it is&#10;only conjectured that they are difficult to solve—a breakthrough in&#10;(quantum) complexity theory or novel kind of computations might only&#10;shift the problem into the future.&#10;&#10;The only unconditionally secure encryption requires a random key with&#10;the same size as the message, a so-called one-time pad. The question is,&#10;how can such a key be distributed securely? Quantum key distribution&#10;provides a solution to that question, by exploiting quantum mechanical&#10;properties of individual particles. Several newly founded companies&#10;already provide small-scale quantum key distribution systems, such as ID&#10;Quantique in Switzerland, MagiQ Technologies in USA, QuintessenceLabs in&#10;Australia or SeQureNet in France.&#10;&#10;As shown in this chapter, fundamental investigations test the&#10;feasibility of global quantum networks, on the order of 100 kilometers&#10;on the Earth’s surface, as well as between ground and space. A second&#10;path of research focuses on more complex quantum states, to improve&#10;data-rates and robustness against noise and eavesdropping attacks. The&#10;experiments discussed in this chapter form only a small subset of&#10;experimental efforts currently in progress around the world. It is clear&#10;that we are perched on the edge of a quantum communication revolution&#10;that will change information security and how we understand privacy for&#10;years to come.">
