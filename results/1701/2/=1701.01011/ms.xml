<outline text="Introduction" _note="Metal-poor galaxies are less chemically evolved galaxies and provide&#10;ideal laboratory for investigating galaxy properties in extreme&#10;condition . Among them, extremely metal-poor galaxies (hereafter XMPGs),&#10;defined by their low oxygen abundance with , are the most promising&#10;young galaxy candidates in the local universe . These XMPGs are&#10;suspected to be primeval galaxies that are undergoing their first major&#10;mass assembly at the observed redshift . Studying these extreme objects&#10;can improve our understanding about the early stages of galaxy assembly.&#10;&#10;The determination for abundance of elements are considered more reliable&#10;if the electron temperature can be measured directly, because the&#10;metallicity is anti-correlated with the electron temperature. The&#10;electron temperature can be obtained using the auroral line ratios, such&#10;as . This technique is often called the method . However, galaxies with&#10;metallicities derived from the method with detections above 3 are&#10;extremely rare. To date, only about 174 such objects has been found .&#10;&#10;In order to enlarge the sample of metal-poor galaxies with 4363&#10;detection, we carry out a systematic search for such objects in the&#10;LAMOST Data Release (DR3, DR4 Q1 and Q2). In Section \[sect:Sample\], we&#10;present our approach for detecting and measuring nebular emission lines,&#10;and the selection criteria used to identify the metal-poor galaxies. We&#10;describe the determination for the dust attenuation properties and the&#10;gas-phase oxygen abundances in Section \[metallicity determination\]. In&#10;Section \[stellar\], we describe the methods for estimating stellar&#10;masses and SFRs, and then compare the mass-metallicity relation (MZR)&#10;and mass-metallicity-SFR relation with local -based relation in Section&#10;\[mz\_fmr\]. In addition, we discuss our results in the context of other&#10;studies in Section \[discussion\]. Finally, we summarize our main&#10;conclusions in Section \[summary\].&#10;&#10;Throughout this paper, we adopt a flat cosmology with , , and km s Mpc&#10;to determine distance-dependent measurements.

The LAMOST Data Release 3 (DR3), Data&#10;Release 4 (DR4) Q1 and Q2, based on the past survey from October 2011 to&#10;February 2016, contain about three million spectra with limiting&#10;magnitude of 18.5 mag. The LAMOST 1D pipeline classifies spectroscopic&#10;targets as galaxies, stars, and QSOs by matching against observed SDSS&#10;spectral templates, see for detail. 92,510 objects from the LAMOST&#10;catalog are spectroscopically classified as galaxies (‘OBJTYPE’ =&#10;‘GALAXY’).">

  <outline text="Sample selection" _note="Among all the galaxies from the LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Surveys (LEGAS), we&#10;first select a subsample of metal-poor galaxies with emission line flux&#10;ratios , which consists of 665 galaxies. Among them, we identify 237&#10;objects with detection at . We inspect these 237 objects visually, and&#10;find 73 of them are false detections. We also exclude 115 objects that&#10;are regions in nearby large galaxies using optical images with SDSS DR12&#10;skyserver [^1]. Finally, we check the right ascension and declination of&#10;the remaining sources, and note that 1 object was observed twice by&#10;LAMOST. We keep the observation that has better spectral quality.&#10;&#10;As a consequence, our final sample consists of 48 galaxies, making up&#10;only of all the LAMOST galaxies until DR4 Q2; this fraction is nearly&#10;the same as SDSS . The median S/N of is 6.1. We obtain the equivalent&#10;width (EW) by dividing the flux by continuum spectral flux intensity,&#10;which is assumed as the average value of observed flux intensities&#10;within 50 wide component around the line. All of the galaxy spectra in&#10;our sample show strong emission lines with a median (average) EW of of&#10;42.9 (53.5) . The EW distribution of is shown in Figure \[hist\_hb\].&#10;&#10;To exclude possible AGN contamination, we use the BPT diagram . Figure&#10;\[bpt\] shows the distribution of our sample in the BPT diagram. The&#10;grayscale 2D histogram shows the number density of LAMOST galaxies. The&#10;blue dots represent 48 galaxies in our final sample, and the black&#10;crosses represent 24 galaxies in our final sample that have also been&#10;spectrally detected by SDSS. Among these 24 galaxies detected with SDSS,&#10;19 galaxy spectra also have the detections above 3; we will compare&#10;these 19 galaxy spectra from LAMOST and SDSS in Section \[comp\_spec\].&#10;The solid and dashed lines are the demarcation curves between SFGs and&#10;AGNs derived by and . Galaxies located between the two lines are usually&#10;classified as composite objects, which may host a mixture of star&#10;formation and AGN. It can be seen that all of the galaxies in our final&#10;sample are located in the star-forming region; however, this is&#10;unsurprising since we initially selected sources with .&#10;&#10;Figure \[spec\] shows example spectra for eight galaxies in our sample&#10;that have both been spectrally detected by LAMOST and SDSS.

All of these spectra show strong emission lines&#10;such as (for all LAMOST spectra and part of SDSS spectra), , , and . The&#10;inserted panels show the zoomed spectra adjacent to lines.

Therefore, we need to&#10;set the atomic recombination data and atomic collision strength data&#10;before the calculation. We adopt the atomic recombination data of for ,&#10;, and for . For collision strength data, we adopt those from for , for ,&#10;and for .&#10;&#10;As encouraged in , we use a cross-converging method to calculate the&#10;electron temperatures of regions () and electron densities () with&#10;ratios of and . Once the electron temperatures and densities are&#10;determined, we can obtain the ionic oxygen abundances using the ratios&#10;with the relation derived from . In order to derive the electron&#10;temperatures of regions, we follow an iterative method used in , where&#10;is the total oxygen abundance, . The temperature and abundance will&#10;converge within five iterations, starting by using the abundance as the&#10;total oxygen abundance. Here, the abundance is determined from and the&#10;ratio using the relation. Using other methods from or , we will get a&#10;higher about 0.02 dex and a lower metallicity about 0.05 dex given a .&#10;Similarly, we will get a higher about 0.03 dex and thus get a lower&#10;metallicity about 0.05 dex when adopt the standard two-zone temperature&#10;model from and . In our final sample, 31 galaxies also have the&#10;detections above 3. Using the ratios to derive , we will get lower and&#10;higher metallicities, the differences between these average values on&#10;and metallicities are about 360 and 0.06 dex, respectively.&#10;&#10;To estimate the uncertainties of electron temperatures, electron&#10;densities and oxygen abundances, we repeat the calculation 2000 times.&#10;For every object, we produce a series of fluxes for each emission line&#10;with a Gaussian distribution, assuming its average is the measured line&#10;flux and standard deviation is the measured error. Then, our final&#10;temperature, density and oxygen abundance are deemed to be the median&#10;values of these 2000 calculations, and the corresponding errors are&#10;estimated as the half of range of their distributions. We list the final&#10;electron temperatures, electron densities and oxygen abundances of our&#10;sample in Table 1.&#10;&#10;Figure \[plot\_hist\] shows the distributions of color excesses,&#10;electron densities, electron temperatures and oxygen abundances. The&#10;electron densities and temperatures in our sample range from to and ,&#10;with median values of and , respectively. Their oxygen abundances range&#10;from 7.63 to 8.46, with a median of 8.16. The only XMPG found in our&#10;sample is ID26 with , which has already been found by with .&#10;Interestingly, galaxy ID33, also named as RC2 A1228+12, was regarded as&#10;an XMPG in and , but the metallicity indicates it is not an XMPG.

We&#10;use the stellar templates of and a initial mass function (IMF) to&#10;synthesize magnitudes. These models span four metallicities (0.004,&#10;0.008, 0.02, 0.05 ) and an exponentially decreasing star formation&#10;models (SFR ) with a step from . We assume the dust attenuation law from&#10;allowing to vary from 0.0 to 2.0 and stellar population ages ranging&#10;from 0 to 100 Gyr. To determine the uncertainties of stellar masses, we&#10;use the Monte Carlo simulations and define the number of simulations as&#10;1000.

However, not all of our sample&#10;galaxies have these photometric measurements. For example, 45 galaxies&#10;have FUV photometry, while 3 galaxies are not located in surveyed areas.&#10;For these three galaxies, we just use their magnitudes from band to band&#10;to perform the SED fitting. We find our sample galaxies spanning three&#10;orders with . We should note that we do not make the point spread&#10;function (PSF) matching for our photometric data using same observation&#10;aperture, which may lead to some uncertainties in stellar mass&#10;measurements. The average and median values on stellar mass measurement&#10;uncertainties are 0.14 dex and 0.12 dex, respectively. However,&#10;comparing our results with total stellar masses in MPA-JHU catalog for&#10;these galaxies included in MPA-JHU catalog, we find the differences of&#10;average and median values are about 0.1 dex and 0.03 dex, respectively.&#10;&#10;\[table1\]">

  <outline text="MZR and FMR" _note="The MZR relation, which was established originally by and developed by ,&#10;, , , , indicates that the metallicities of galaxies correlate with&#10;their stellar masses. Taking SFR into consideration, found that&#10;metallicity decreases with increasing SFR at low stellar mass, while&#10;does not depend on SFR at high stellar mass (). However, suggested that&#10;high-mass () galaxies have lower metallicities when their SFRs are&#10;lower. These different results may be caused by different metallicity&#10;calculation methods. In addition, the MZR is also affected by other&#10;physical parameters, such as stellar age and gas fraction. found that&#10;the metallicity is strongly dependent on the , which interpreted&#10;galaxies with older stellar ages as having higher metallicities at a&#10;fixed stellar mass. found that galaxies with higher gas fraction have&#10;lower metallicities at a fixed mass. and argued that the MZR is in fact&#10;a projection of FMR. In the past years, many efforts (e.g., ) have been&#10;made to explore the MZR and FMR feasibility from low mass to high mass,&#10;as well as the evolution with redshift. In the local universe, the&#10;metallicity increases with increasing stellar mass, and decreases with&#10;increasing SFR at a fixed stellar mass when . found that the metallicity&#10;is anti-corrected with specific SFR regardless of different metallicity&#10;indicators or methods used when , while the dependence is weak or absent&#10;for massive galaxies when . also demonstrated that the relative specific&#10;SFR is a more physically motivated second parameter for the MZR, and&#10;found that the overall scatter in the FMR relation does not&#10;significantly decrease relative to the dispersion in the MZR. Recently,&#10;reported that the FMR is between stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass&#10;instead of the SFR. In addition, measured the metallicity of&#10;star-forming galaxies based on and calibrations, and found that whether&#10;the FMR exists or not depend on the metallicity measurement method. The&#10;dependence on metallicity and SFR at high stellar mass is still in&#10;argument . For the intermediate redshift universe, showed clearly that&#10;the MZR evolves toward lower metallicity at fixed stellar mass with&#10;increasing redshift , and found a much weaker dependence of MZR on SFR&#10;than in the local universe.&#10;&#10;In panel of Figure \[fmr\_rela\], we colour-code our galaxy points with&#10;their SFRs. Figure \[fmr\_rela\] shows that most of galaxies in our&#10;sample have higher metallicities than that of galaxies in , but are&#10;consistent with the result in . The difference between our work and may&#10;be caused by difference in sample selection and calibrations for&#10;electron temperatures and . found that the scatter in MZR for the M-SFR&#10;stacks with -based metallicity is 0.22 dex, while the scatter in the FMR&#10;is 0.13 dex. The decrease of scatter value in reflects a strong&#10;SFR-dependence on the MZR. From visual examination, we do not find&#10;strong dependence of MZR on SFR. However, the scatter in FMR is 0.24&#10;dex, lower than the 0.28 dex scatter in MZR, suggesting MZR is weakly&#10;dependent on SFR. We note that the average and median values of&#10;metallicity measurement uncertainties are 0.09 dex and 0.08 dex,&#10;respectively. The average and median values on stellar mass measurement&#10;uncertainties are about 0.14 dex and 0.12 dex, respectively. The larger&#10;scatters in MZR and FMR compared with relations may be caused by the&#10;small galaxy sample size, as well as the measurement uncertainties on&#10;stellar mass.">
