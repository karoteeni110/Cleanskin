    <title>The Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102 as Seen on Milliarcsecond
Angular Scales</title>
    <abstract>The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the
sub-arcsecond localization ( mas precision) of [FRB 121102]{}using the
VLA has led to its unambiguous association with persistent radio and
optical counterparts, and to the identification of its host galaxy.
However, an even more precise localization is needed in order to probe
the direct physical relationship between the millisecond bursts
themselves and the associated persistent emission. Here we report
very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations using the European
VLBI Network and the 305-m Arecibo telescope, which simultaneously
detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at
milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to
within a projected linear separation of  pc ( mas angular separation, at
95% confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts
and persistent radio source (– at 1.7 GHz), which are both similar to
the expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio
source has a projected size constrained to be ( mas angular extent at
5.0 GHz) and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of . Together,
these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link
between [FRB 121102]{}and the compact persistent radio source. We argue
that a burst source associated with a low-luminosity active galactic
nucleus or a young neutron star energizing a supernova remnant are the
two scenarios for [FRB 121102]{}that best match the observed data. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient sources of unknown physical&#10;origin, which are characterized by their short ( ms), highly dispersed,&#10;and bright (–) pulses. Thus far, 18 FRBs have been discovered using&#10;single dish observations . Unambiguous associations with multiwavelength&#10;counterparts have been extremely limited by the poor localization that&#10;such telescopes provide (uncertainty regions of at least several square&#10;arcminutes). reported the first apparent localization of an FRB by&#10;associating FRB 150418 with a pseudo-contemporaneous transient radio&#10;source in a galaxy at . However, further studies have shown that the&#10;transient source continues to vary in brightness well after the initial&#10;FRB 150418 burst detection, and can be explained by a scintillating,&#10;low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN; e.g. ), which leaves&#10;limited grounds to claim an unambiguous association with FRB 150418.&#10;&#10;Thus far, [FRB 121102]{}is the only known FRB to have shown repeated&#10;bursts with consistent dispersion measure (DM) and sky localization .&#10;Recently, using fast-dump interferometric imaging with the Karl G.&#10;Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), [FRB 121102]{}has been localized to&#10; milliarcsecond (mas) precision . The precise localization of these&#10;bursts has led to associations with both persistent radio and optical&#10;sources, and the identification of [FRB 121102]{}’s host galaxy .&#10;European VLBI Network (EVN) observations, confirmed by the Very Long&#10;Baseline Array (VLBA), have shown that the persistent source is compact&#10;on milliarcsecond scales . Optical observations have identified a faint&#10;( AB mag) and extended (–) counterpart in Keck and Gemini data, located&#10;at a redshift – i.e. at a luminosity distance of , and implying an&#10;angular diameter distance of . The centroids of the persistent optical&#10;and radio emission are offset from each other by , and the observed&#10;optical emission lines are dominated by star formation, with an&#10;estimated star formation rate of . In X-rays, [XMM-NEWTON]{} and&#10;[CHANDRA]{} observations provide a 5- upper limit in the – keV band of .&#10;&#10;In the past few years, significant efforts have been made to detect and&#10;localize millisecond transient signals using the EVN . This was made&#10;possible by the recently commissioned EVN Software Correlator (SFXC; )&#10;at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE; Dwingeloo, the Netherlands).&#10;Here we present joint Arecibo and EVN observations of&#10;[FRB 121102]{}which simultaneously detect both the persistent radio&#10;source as well as four bursts from [FRB 121102]{}, localizing both to&#10;milliarcsecond precision. In §\[sec:obs\] we present the observations&#10;and data analysis. In §\[sec:results\] we describe the results and in&#10;§\[sec:discussion\] we discuss the properties of the persistent source&#10;and its co-localization with the source of the bursts. A discussion of&#10;the constraints that these data place on the physical scenarios is also&#10;provided. Finally, we present our conclusions in §\[sec:conclusion\].">

These observations included the 305-m William E.&#10;Gordon Telescope at the Arecibo Observatory (which provides raw&#10;sensitivity for high signal-to-noise burst detection) and the following&#10;regular EVN stations: Effelsberg, Hartebeesthoek, Lovell Telescope or&#10;Mk2 in Jodrell Bank, Medicina, Noto, Onsala, Tianma, Toruń, Westerbork&#10;(single dish), and Yebes.

  <outline text="Arecibo Single Dish Data" _note="For the 1.7-GHz observations, Arecibo single-dish observations used the&#10;Puerto-Rican Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument (PUPPI) in&#10;combination with the L-band Wide receiver, which provided of usable&#10;bandwidth between –. The PUPPI data were coherently dedispersed to a ,&#10;as previously done by . Coherent dedispersion removes the dispersive&#10;smearing of the burst width within each spectral channel. The time&#10;resolution of the data was , and we recorded full Stokes parameters. At&#10;5 GHz, the Arecibo single-dish observations were recorded with the Mock&#10;Spectrometers in combination with the C-band receiver, which together&#10;provided spectral coverage from –. The Mock data were recorded in 7&#10;partially overlapping subbands of 172 MHz, with 5.376-MHz channels and&#10;time resolution. In addition to the PUPPI and Mock data, the&#10;autocorrelations of the Arecibo data from the VLBI recording were also&#10;available (these are restricted to only 64 MHz of bandwidth, see below).&#10;&#10;The Arecibo single-dish data were analyzed using tools from the&#10;[PRESTO]{}[^1] suite of pulsar software , and searched for bursts using&#10;standard procedures . The data were first subbanded to lower time and&#10;frequency resolution and were then dedispersed using [prepsubband]{} to&#10;trial DMs between – in order to search for pulses that peak in&#10;signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at the expected DM of [FRB 121102]{}. This&#10;is required to separate astrophysical bursts from radio frequency&#10;interference (RFI). For each candidate burst found using&#10;[single\_pulse\_search.py]{} (and grouping common events across DM&#10;trials), the astrophysical nature was confirmed by producing a frequency&#10;versus time diagram to show that the signal is (relatively) broadband&#10;compared to the narrow-band RFI signals that can sometimes masquerade as&#10;dispersed pulses.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Available at https://github.com/scottransom/presto">

  <outline text="Arecibo+EVN Interferometric Data" _note="EVN data were acquired in real time using the e-EVN setup, in which the&#10;data are transferred to the central processing center at JIVE via&#10;high-speed fibre networks and correlated using the SFXC software&#10;correlator. The high data rate of VLBI observations requires&#10;visibilities to be typically averaged to 2-s intervals during&#10;correlation, which is sufficient to study persistent compact sources&#10;near the correlation phase center, like the persistent radio counterpart&#10;to [FRB 121102]{}. However, we also buffered the baseband EVN data to&#10;produce high-time-resolution correlations afterwards for specific times&#10;when bursts have been identified in the Arecibo single-dish data.&#10;&#10;We used J0529+3209 as phase calibrator in all sessions ( away from&#10;[FRB 121102]{}). In the first five sessions (conducted in Feb and May)&#10;we scheduled phase referencing cycles of 8 min on the target and 1 min&#10;on the phase calibrator. Whereas this setup maximized the on-source time&#10;for burst searches, it provided less accurate astrometry due to poorer&#10;phase solutions. The pulsar B0525+21 was also observed in one of these&#10;sessions following the same strategy (phase referenced using&#10;J0521+2112), in order to perform an empirical analysis of the derived&#10;astrometry in interferometric single-burst imaging. In the following&#10;three sessions in September, however, we conducted 5-min cycles with&#10;3.5 min on the target and 1.5 min on the phase calibrator, improving the&#10;phase referencing, and hence providing more accurate astrometry. Two&#10;sessions failed to produce useful calibrated data on the faint target,&#10;and are not listed in Table \[tab:data\]. The first session (2016 Feb 1)&#10;was used to explore different calibration approaches, whereas the 2016&#10;Sep 19 session was unusable because the largest EVN stations were&#10;unavailable and the data could not be properly calibrated without them.&#10;An extragalactic  mJy compact source , was identified in the same&#10;primary beam as [FRB 121102]{}(with coordinates ). This source has been&#10;used to acquire relative astrometry of [FRB 121102]{}during all the&#10;sessions and to provide a proper motion constraint.&#10;&#10;The 2-s integrated data were calibrated using standard VLBI procedures&#10;within AIPS[^1] and ParselTongue , including [A PRIORI]{} amplitude&#10;calibration using system temperatures and gain curves for each antenna,&#10;antenna-based delay correction and bandpass calibration. The phases were&#10;corrected by fringe-fitting the calibrators. The phase calibrator&#10;J0529+3209 was then imaged and self-calibrated using the Caltech Difmap&#10;package . These corrections were interpolated and applied to&#10;[FRB 121102]{}, which was finally imaged in Difmap.&#10;&#10;The arrival times of the bursts were first identified using Arecibo&#10;single-dish data, and then slightly refined for application to the EVN&#10;data. First using coherently dedispersed Arecibo auto-correlations from&#10;the EVN data, we performed a so-called gate search by creating a large&#10;number of short integrations inside a 50-ms window around the nominal&#10;Arecibo single-dish arrival times. A pulse profile was then created for&#10;each of the bursts by plotting the total power in the cross-correlations&#10;as a function of time. We then used this pulse profile to determine the&#10;exact time window for which the correlation function was accumulated,&#10;i.e. the ‘gate’. We de-dispersed and correlated the EVN data to produce&#10;visibilities for windows covering only the times of detected bursts. We&#10;applied the previously described calibration to the single-pulse data&#10;and imaged them. The final images were produced using a Briggs robust&#10;weighting of zero as it produced the most consistent results (balance&#10;between the longest baselines to Arecibo and the shorter, intra-European&#10;baselines). Images with natural or uniform weighting did not produce&#10;satisfactory results due to the sparse -coverage. The flux densities and&#10;positions for all datasets were measured using Difmap and CASA[^2] by&#10;fitting a circular Gaussian component to the detected source in the&#10;-plane.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The Astronomical Image Processing System, AIPS, is a software&#10;    package produced and maintained by the National Radio Astronomy&#10;    Observatory (NRAO).&#10;&#10;[^2]: The Common Astronomy Software Applications, CASA, is software&#10;    produced and maintained by the NRAO.">

  <outline text="Burst Detections" _note="The EVN observations detect the compact and persistent source found by&#10;with a synthesized beam size (FWHM) of at 1.7 GHz and at 5 GHz, with&#10;position angle in both cases.&#10;&#10;On 2016 Sep 20, we detected four individual bursts in the Arecibo&#10;single-dish PUPPI data that overlap with EVN data acquisition&#10;(Table \[tab:data\]). No bursts were detected in the Arecibo PUPPI&#10;(1.7 GHz) or Mock (5 GHz) data from other sessions in which there are&#10;simultaneous EVN observations that can be used for imaging the bursts.&#10;We formed images from the calibrated visibility data for each burst, and&#10;measured their positions with respect to the persistent radio source.&#10;Figure \[fig:burst\_image\] shows these positions together with the&#10;persistent source at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz. The nominal positions measured for&#10;the four bursts are spread around the position of the persistent source,&#10;and we discuss this scatter in §\[sec:astrometry\].&#10;&#10;Figures \[fig:pulse\_det1\] and \[fig:pulse\_det2\] show data&#10;corresponding to the strongest burst (Burst \#2) – in the time-domain&#10;and in the image plane, respectively. We have characterized the bursts&#10;using the detection statistic . When matched filtering is done to detect&#10;a pulse (as we have done, starting with the single-dish PUPPI data),&#10;then the S/N of the detection statistic, i.e. the output of the&#10;correlation, is proportional to . Localization of the source in an image&#10;(whether in the image or in the [UV]{} domain) will tend to have the&#10;same scaling if the [UV]{} data are calculated with a tight gate (time&#10;window) around the pulse so that it also scales as . Using only fluence&#10;as a detection statistic is not appropriate because a high-fluence, very&#10;wide burst can still be buried in the noise, whereas a narrower burst&#10;with equivalent fluence is more easily discriminated from noise.&#10;Burst \#2 was roughly an order-of-magnitude brighter than the other 3&#10;bursts, and shows a detection statistic that is also a factor of higher&#10;than the other bursts. This brightest burst is separated by only from&#10;the centroid of the persistent source at the same epoch and is&#10;positionally consistent at the - level. We thus find no convincing&#10;evidence that there is a significant offset between the source of the&#10;bursts and the persistent source. Since Burst \#2’s detection statistic,&#10;, is significantly larger than for any of the other three bursts, its&#10;apparent position is least affected by noise in the image plane, as we&#10;explain in the following section, §\[sec:astrometry\]. As such, in&#10;principle it provides the most accurate position of all 4 detected&#10;bursts, and the strongest constraint on the maximum offset between&#10;bursts and the compact, persistent radio source.&#10;&#10;\&#10;\&#10;&#10;\&#10;">

  <outline text="Astrometric Accuracy" _note="The astrometric accuracy of full-track (horizon-to-horizon observations)&#10;EVN phase-referencing is usually limited by systematic errors due to the&#10;poorly modeled troposphere, ionosphere and other factors. These errors&#10;are less than a milliarcsecond in ideal cases , but in practice they can&#10;be a few milliarcseconds. Given the short duration of the bursts (a few&#10;milliseconds), our interferometric EVN data only contain a limited&#10;number of visibilities for each burst, which results in a limited&#10;-coverage and thus very strong, nearly equal-power sidelobes in the&#10;image plane (see Figure \[fig:pulse\_det2\], bottom panel). In this case&#10;we are no longer limited only by the low-level systematics described&#10;above. The errors in the visibilities, either systematic or due to&#10;thermal noise, may lead to large and non-Gaussian uncertainties in the&#10;position, especially for low S/N, because the response function has many&#10;sidelobes. It is not straightforward to derive the astrometric errors&#10;for data with just a few-milliseconds integration. Therefore, we&#10;conducted the following procedure to verify the validity of the observed&#10;positions and to estimate the errors.&#10;&#10;First, we independently estimated the approximate position of the&#10;strongest burst by fringe-fitting the burst data and using only the&#10;residual delays (delay mapping; ). With this method we have obtained an&#10;approximate position of , where the quoted errors are at the 3- level.&#10;This method provides additional confidence that the image-plane&#10;detection of the bursts is genuine, since the positions obtained with&#10;the two methods are consistent at the 3- level.&#10;&#10;Next, we carried out an empirical analysis of single-burst EVN&#10;astrometry by imaging 406 pulses recorded from the pulsar B0525+21,&#10;which was used as a test source in the 2016 Feb 11 session. PSR B0525+21&#10;has typical pulse widths of roughly 200 ms and peak flux densities of –.&#10;This corresponds to a range of measured detection statistics – Jy ms,&#10;compared to the range – Jy ms measured for the 4 detected&#10;[FRB 121102]{}bursts. Figure \[fig:test\_source\] shows the obtained&#10;positions for the different PSR B0525+21 pulses along with the&#10;synthesized beam FWHM for comparison. This demonstrates that the&#10;positional accuracy of the bursts increases for larger . It shows that&#10;pulses with  Jy ms are typically offset by less than the beam FWHM,&#10;whereas for – Jy ms the scatter can be closer to 10 mas. This matches&#10;well with what we have observed in the four detected&#10;[FRB 121102]{}bursts (Table \[tab:data\], Figure \[fig:burst\_image\]).&#10;&#10;While Burst \#2 is thus expected to provide the most accurate position,&#10;a more conservative way to estimate the positional error on the burst&#10;source is to consider the scatter in all four detections, which is  mas&#10;around the average position. In Figure \[fig:burst\_image\] we show the&#10;average position from the four observed bursts, weighted by their&#10;detection statistic (Table \[tab:data\]). This average position&#10;(separated with respect to the persistent source) shows that the average&#10;burst position and the persistent source position are coincident within&#10;. We therefore claim no significant positional offset between the&#10;persistent radio source and the source of the [FRB 121102]{}bursts.&#10;&#10;Finally, we place limits on the angular separation between the source of&#10;the bursts and the persistent radio source by sampling from Gaussian&#10;distributions with centers and widths given by the source positions and&#10;uncertainties listed in Table \[tab:data\] and deriving a numerical&#10;distribution of offsets. Using the average burst position compared to&#10;that of the persistent source, this results in a separation of  mas&#10;( pc) at the 95% confidence level (or  pc at 99.5% confidence level).&#10;Although the positional uncertainties on individual bursts are likely&#10;underestimated and non-Gaussian, as discussed previously, the effect of&#10;this should be mitigated somewhat by using the average burst position,&#10;which includes an uncertainty determined by the scatter in the separate&#10;burst detections, as also seen in Figure \[fig:test\_source\] for&#10;B0525+21. We note that nearly identical separation limits are obtained&#10;if we consider instead the position of only the strongest burst,&#10;Burst \#2.">

  <outline text="Measured Properties" _note="Fitting the -plane data with a circular Gaussian component shows that&#10;both the bursts and persistent radio source appear to be slightly&#10;extended. We measure a source size of at 1.7 GHz in the detected bursts&#10;in the -plane. In the persistent source we measure a similar value of –&#10;at 1.7 GHz in all sessions, whereas at 5.0 GHz we measure an angular&#10;size of –. Measurements in the image plane (after deconvolving the&#10;synthesized beam) result in similar values. The measured source sizes&#10;for the persistent source are consistent with the ones obtained in .&#10;&#10;\&#10;&#10;Notably, Burst \#2 shows two pulse components, separated by&#10;approximately 1 ms (Figure \[fig:pulse\_det1\]). Complex profile&#10;structure is commonly seen in the brightest [FRB 121102]{} bursts&#10;observed to date, many of which show two or more pulse components .&#10;Furthermore, as can be seen in the dynamic spectrum of the burst, there&#10;is fine-scale frequency structure ( MHz) in the intensity, which in&#10;principle could be due to scintillation or self noise. This will be&#10;investigated in more detail in a forthcoming paper.&#10;&#10;The different epochs at which the persistent radio source was observed&#10;allow us to obtain the light-curve of the compact source.&#10;Figure \[fig:lightcurve\] shows the flux densities measured for the five&#10;sessions at 1.7 GHz, which are compatible with an average flux density&#10;of .

  <outline text="Persistent Source and Burst Properties" _note="The results from all the EVN observations conducted at 1.7 GHz show a&#10;compact source with a persistent emission of , which is consistent with&#10;the flux densities inferred at larger angular scales with the VLA . No&#10;significant, short-term changes in the flux density are observed after&#10;the arrival of the bursts or otherwise (Figure \[fig:lightcurve\]). The&#10;average flux density of the persistent source implies a radio luminosity&#10;of . The single measured flux density at 5.0 GHz corresponds to a&#10;similar luminosity of (, with a bandwidth of 128 MHz at both&#10;frequencies). Additionally, the 5.0-GHz data allow us to set a&#10;constraint on the brightness temperature of the persistent source of .&#10;Considering the measured radio luminosities and the current 5- X-ray&#10;upper limit in the – keV band of we infer a ratio between the 5.0-GHz&#10;radio and X-ray luminosities of , where as defined by . The strongest&#10;observed burst exhibits a luminosity of at 1.7 GHz in the 2-ms&#10;integrated data. These values imply an energy of , where is the emission&#10;solid angle.&#10;&#10;With the EVN sessions spanning a period of approximately 7 months, we&#10;derived a constraint on the proper motion of the persistent source of ,&#10;and at a 3- confidence level. These values have been obtained after&#10;removing the offsets measured in the in-beam calibrator source (VLA2,&#10;see § \[sec:obs\]). Since most of our short observations were not ideal&#10;for astrometry, this is a preliminary result, to be further improved on&#10;by follow-up observations, which will also have the advantage of&#10;spanning a longer period of time. Nonetheless, these results already&#10;rule out the presence of parallax at a 3- confidence level, setting a&#10;distance for the persistent source .&#10;&#10;The compactness of the source at 5.0 GHz allows us to set an upper limit&#10;on its projected physical size of (, given the distance of the source).&#10;The angular size measured for the source at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz ( and  mas,&#10;respectively) is consistent with the angular broadening expected in the&#10;direction to [FRB 121102]{}for extragalactic sources due to local&#10;scattering (multi-path propagation) of the signal by the intervening&#10;Galactic material between the source and the observer (predicted by the&#10;NE2001 model to be at 1.7 GHz; ). Angular broadening scales as and thus&#10;we would expect a size of at 5.0 GHz, also roughly consistent with the&#10;measured value at that frequency.&#10;&#10;The obtained angular sizes are thus likely to be produced by angular&#10;broadening and not by the fact that we are resolving the source. The&#10;angular broadening measured in the bursts () supports this statement as&#10;this broadening must be produced extrinsically to the bursts, given that&#10;their millisecond duration implies that the emitting region must be&#10;smaller than the light-crossing time, i.e. , and thus must appear to be&#10;point-like. A caveat here is that the measured source size depends&#10;strongly on the gain of the telescope providing the longest baselines ,&#10;in our case Arecibo at 1.7 GHz. We exclude the possibility that the&#10;Arecibo baselines have a lower amplitude (due to a large gain error),&#10;because the measured persistent source size agrees with that obtained&#10;with the VLBA independently . At 5.0 GHz the presence of three&#10;telescopes with similar baseline lengths (Arecibo, Hartebeesthoek and&#10;Tianma) also assures the consistency of the measured source size.&#10;&#10;The intrinsic source size of the persistent source could be as small as&#10;, the limit implied by synchrotron self-absorption for a frequency of&#10;optical depth unity . Or if  K by synchrotron self-Compton radiation,&#10;the size is . These angles are too small to resolve with VLBI but could&#10;be probed with interstellar scintillations.&#10;&#10;We have constrained the projected separation between the source of the&#10;bursts and the persistent radio source to be . Such a close proximity&#10;strongly suggests that there is a direct physical link between the&#10;bursts and the persistent source, as we now discuss in more detail.">

  <outline text="Possible Origins of &lt;span&gt;FRB 121102&lt;/span&gt;" _note="The data presented here, in addition to the results presented by and ,&#10;allow us to constrain the possible physical scenarios for the origin of&#10;[FRB 121102]{}. While the fact that the bursts are located within of the&#10;persistent radio source strongly suggests a direct physical link, the&#10;persistent radio source and the source of the [FRB 121102]{}bursts don’t&#10;necessarily have to be the same object. We primarily consider two&#10;classes of models that could explain [FRB 121102]{}and its&#10;multiwavelength counterparts: a highly energetic, extragalactic neutron&#10;star in a young supernova remnant (SNR) or an active galactic nucleus&#10;(AGN; or analogously a black hole related system with a jet).">
    <outline text="Young neutron star and nebula" _note="As previously shown by , the repeatability of [FRB 121102]{}rules out an&#10;origin in a cataclysmic event that destroyed the progenitor source, e.g.&#10;the collapse of a supramassive neutron star . The repetition and&#10;energetics of the bursts from FRB 121102 have been used to argue that it&#10;comes from a young neutron star or magnetar . At birth, the rapid spin&#10;of such (potentially highly magnetized) objects can power a luminous&#10;nebula from the region evacuated by its SNR.&#10;&#10;The measured luminosity for the persistent radio source cannot be&#10;explained by a single SNR or a pulsar wind nebula similar to those&#10;discovered thus far in our Galaxy. A direct comparison with one of the&#10;brightest SNRs known, Cas A , shows that we would expect an emission&#10;which is orders of magnitude fainter at the given distance of . In the&#10;case of the Crab Nebula, the expected flux density would be even fainter&#10;() if placed in the host galaxy of [FRB 121102]{}. Compact star forming&#10;regions, such as seen in Arp 220, have collections of SNRs that have a&#10;luminosity and consistent with the persistent radio source. However,&#10;neither the SFR of – nor the size of the region of – of Arp 220 agrees&#10;with the properties of the persistent source associated with&#10;[FRB 121102]{}( and ).&#10;&#10; and discuss the properties of a young () SNR that is powered by the&#10;spin-down power of a neutron star or white dwarf. The SNR expands into&#10;the surrounding medium and evacuates an ionized region that can be seen&#10;as a luminous synchrotron nebula. This model is also constrained by the&#10;observation that radio bursts of [FRB 121102]{}are not absorbed by the&#10;nebula and that its DM has not evolved significantly over the last few&#10;years. Considering all these effects, in this scenario [FRB 121102]{}is&#10;likely to be between 100 and 1000 yr old and the persistent radio source&#10;is powered by the spin down of a rapidly rotating pulsar or magnetar. In&#10;this case, the previously shown persistent radio source variability&#10;could be induced by scintillation, which is consistent with the compact&#10;(sub-milliarcsecond) SNR size at this age. and show that superluminous&#10;supernovae (SLSNe) are typically hosted by low-metallicity, low-mass&#10;galaxies, and are possibly powered by millisecond magnetars.&#10;Additionally, it is shown that SLSNe and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs)&#10;could share similar environments. We note that these conditions are in&#10;agreement with the optical galaxy associated with [FRB 121102]{}.">

    <outline text="Active galactic nucleus / accreting black hole" _note="Models have been proposed in which the bursts are due to strong plasma&#10;turbulence excited by the relativistic jet of an AGN or due to&#10;synchrotron maser activity from an AGN . It is also conceivable to have&#10;an extremely young and energetic pulsar and/or magnetar near to an AGN –&#10;either interacting or not.&#10;&#10;The persistent radio source is offset by  arcsec (0.7 kpc) from the&#10;apparent center of the optical emission of the dwarf galaxy . Therefore,&#10;it is not completely clear whether the radio source can be associated&#10;with the galactic nucleus or not, but an offset AGN is plausible as&#10;reported in other galaxies . If the persistent source is indeed an AGN&#10;in the right accretion state, we can infer the mass of the black hole&#10;assuming the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity . Given the&#10;measured radio luminosity and the upper limit on the X-ray value, we&#10;estimate a lower limit on the mass of the putative black hole of . This&#10;value would be hard to reconcile with the fact that the stellar mass of&#10;the host galaxy is likely at least an order of magnitude less than that,&#10;and its optical spectrum shows no signatures of AGN activity .&#10;&#10;Alternatively, we could be witnessing a radio-loud, but otherwise&#10;low-luminosity AGN powered by a much less massive black hole that&#10;accretes at a very low rate. This population is poorly known, but EVN&#10;observations of the brightest low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) in a sample&#10;of Fundamental Plane outliers (i.e. radio-loud, with ) show that some of&#10;these have extended jets/lobes and the radio excess may come from strong&#10;interaction with the surrounding gas in the galaxy; others appear very&#10;compact like our persistent radio source, and the reason for their high&#10;remains a mystery . We note that there are other recent examples of&#10;LLAGNs identified based on their VLBI properties coupled with low-levels&#10;of X-ray emission and no signs of nuclear activity from the optical&#10;emission lines .&#10;&#10;Other possible associations, like a single X-ray binary (such as&#10;Cyg X-3; ) or an ultraluminous X-ray nebula (such as S 26 and/or&#10;IC 342 X-1; ), do not fit to the measured flux density of the persistent&#10;radio emission and/or the observed size by several orders of magnitude.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="The bursts of [FRB 121102]{}have recently been associated with a&#10;persistent and compact radio source and a low-metallicity star forming&#10;dwarf galaxy at a redshift of . The EVN data presented in this work show&#10;for the first time that the bursts and the persistent source are&#10;co-located with an angular separation ( given the distance to the host&#10;galaxy). This tight constraint – roughly an order of magnitude more&#10;precise localization compared to that achieved with the VLA in –&#10;strongly suggests a direct physical link, though the persistent radio&#10;source and the source of the [FRB 121102]{}bursts don’t necessarily have&#10;to be the same object. Although the origin of FRBs remains unknown, the&#10;data presented here are consistent in many respects with either an&#10;interpretation in terms of a low-luminosity AGN or a young SNR powered&#10;by a highly energetic neutron star/magnetar.&#10;&#10;We thank the directors and staff of all the EVN telescopes for making&#10;this series of target of opportunity observations possible.
