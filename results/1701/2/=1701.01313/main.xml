    <title>Cubical accessibility and bounds on curves on surfaces</title>
    <abstract>We bound the size of -dimensional cubulations of finitely presented
groups. We apply this bound to obtain acylindrical accessibility for
actions on CAT(0) cube complexes and bounds on curves on surfaces. </abstract>
