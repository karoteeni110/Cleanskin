A is a cross such that:&#10;&#10;,&#10;&#10;if , there exist elements and such that ,&#10;&#10;if , then ,&#10;&#10;there exists an element such that .&#10;&#10;Given two halfspaces , we say that is LOCALLY PARALLEL to if they are&#10;adjacent and for any between them and any other adjacent pair admits an&#10;of dimension greater or equal to the one of .&#10;&#10;We emphasize the fact that these definitions are oriented. In&#10;particular, if is locally parallel to in , it does not imply that is&#10;locally parallel to with respect to the inverse orientation of .&#10;&#10;\[lemma0\] Let be an interval, and let be a non-maximal halfspace. Then&#10;there exists an adjacent halfspace , for which any admits a .&#10;&#10;We call such a halfspace a .&#10;&#10;Let be the set of halfspaces adjacent to and above . If one element of&#10;does not share an with then it verifies the Lemma.&#10;&#10;Otherwise for each , let be an for the pair . To prove the lemma we need&#10;to show that one of these admits a .&#10;&#10;Notice that if some is empty, then is a for . Similarly, if is not empty&#10;and there is no halfspace in which is strictly below , then is a for .&#10;We thus can assume that for all the set is non-empty and there exists&#10;such that (and in particular, is non-empty).&#10;&#10;Notice that for any there exists such that , and therefore for some , we&#10;have . This implies that .&#10;&#10;Let be a minimal subset of such that .&#10;&#10;For any proper non-empty subset , there exists such that&#10;&#10;By contradiction, assume that for all , we have . But this implies that&#10;But since verifies , it would imply that verifies which contradicts the&#10;minimality of .&#10;&#10;Let us now construct a for some element of . Choose some , and set and .&#10;We will construct subsets , of size , and crosses inductively, so that&#10;they satisfy:&#10;&#10;,&#10;&#10;, and&#10;&#10; is strictly contained in .&#10;&#10;We construct from in the following way. By the claim there exists such&#10;that an element of belongs to . If , then is a for , and we are done.&#10;Otherwise , and we can define and accordingly .&#10;&#10;If we did not find a in the process, we end up (after steps) with and .&#10;But since , is transverse to every element of and therefore (which&#10;satisfies ) is a for .">
