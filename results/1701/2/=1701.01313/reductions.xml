<outline text="Reductions for sequences" _note="The goal of this section is to describe the various reductions we will&#10;use when considering sequences of pairs of halfspaces and crosses. We&#10;assume throughout that the intervals involved have dimension at most .&#10;&#10;A CHAIN of halfspaces is a sequence of halfspaces such that either , or&#10;. We say that the chain is INCREASING, DECREASING, or CONSTANT&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;A CHAIN OF -TUPLES is a sequence of -tuples of halfspaces such that for&#10;all , the sequence is a chain.&#10;&#10;A sequence of crosses is REGULARLY ORDERED if all crosses have same&#10;dimension and if there exists a chain of -tuples , such that . It is&#10;REGULARLY INCREASING, if non of the chains are decreasing. A SUBCHAIN of&#10;a regularly ordered sequence of crosses is one of the chains .&#10;&#10;\[Ramsey\] For all there exists such that any sequence of (not&#10;necessarily distinct) halfspaces contains a subsequence which is a chain&#10;of length .&#10;&#10;By applying Observation \[Ramsey\] several times one can deduce the&#10;following lemmas.&#10;&#10;\[Ramseypowerup\] For every and every there exists such that every&#10;sequence of -tuples of halfspaces. Then there exist subsequence of&#10;-tuples which is a chain of -tuples.&#10;&#10;The following lemma, which follows from Ramsey’s Theorem, shows that for&#10;an increasing chain of pairs one can reduce to one of two extreme&#10;scenarios:&#10;&#10;a STAIRCASE is an increasing chain of pairs such that for all and for&#10;all ,&#10;&#10;a LADDER is an increasing chain of pairs such that for all and for all .&#10;&#10;\[reductionforpairs\] For every there exists such that for every set of&#10;distinct adjacent pairs of halfspaces there exists a increasing chain&#10;sequence of pairs which is either a staircase or a ladder.&#10;&#10;By applying Lemma \[Ramseypowerup\] we may assume that is a chain, and&#10;by reordering we may assume that that both subchain are increasing&#10;(notice that bounds the number of distinct adjacent halfspaces to a&#10;given halfspace ). Let us consider the graph whose vertices are the&#10;pairs , and whose edges are the pairs and () such that crosses . By&#10;Ramsey’s theorem there exists such that either there exists a -clique or&#10;a -independent set, these correspond to the staircase and ladder&#10;scenarios.&#10;&#10;Given a chain of pairs and a chain of halfspaces . we say that the chain&#10;of halfspaces is TAME with respect to the chain of pairs if for all , we&#10;have . The chain of halfspaces is WILD if for all .&#10;&#10;Let be a chain of pairs and be a regularly ordered chain of crosses. The&#10;chain of crosses is WEAKLY TAME if for each halfspace we have . It is&#10;TAME if one of its subchains is tame. It is -TAME if for all subchain of&#10;halfspaces , either the chain is tame or for all , .&#10;&#10;Note that in the case of crosses, tame and -tame imply weakly tame.&#10;However since may be empty, -tame does not imply tame.&#10;&#10;\[reductionforcrosses\] For all there exists such that for every&#10;sequence of crosses of dimension there exists a regularly increasing&#10;sequence of crosses of dimension such that if have any of the following&#10;properties&#10;&#10;tame;&#10;&#10;;&#10;&#10;having a subchain such that ;&#10;&#10;with respect to , then have the same properties with respect to . If&#10;moreover are weakly tame then one can choose so that every subchain of&#10;is either tame of wild.&#10;&#10;By applying Lemma \[Ramseypowerup\] we may pass to a subsequence of&#10;crosses which is regularly ordered. By abuse of notation we will assume&#10;that are regularly ordered. Let us consider the crosses The sequence is&#10;a regularly increasing sequence of crosses. Moreover, each of the three&#10;properties in the lemma pass on to .&#10;&#10;As in the proof of Lemma \[reductionforpairs\], an application of&#10;Ramsey’s theorem shows that for big enough, we can pass to a subsequence&#10;of crosses, which by abuse of notation we will denote again by such that&#10;every subchain of is either tame or wild. Since the three properties&#10;pass to subsequences they remain true for . Note that weak tameness is&#10;needed to insure that each is below or transverse to , and thus is not&#10;above all .&#10;&#10;\[vertical horizontal trick\] Let be a staircase, and let be a tame&#10;regularly increasing sequence of crosses of dimension such that any&#10;subchain is either tame or wild. Assume that each cross contains a&#10;halfspace such that . Then there exists a regularly increasing sequence&#10;of crosses of dimension which are tame and -tame , with tame or wild&#10;subchains with respect to the chain of pairs of even indices where .&#10;&#10;Let (resp. ) be the set of all wild (resp. tame) halfspaces in . Then&#10;the sequence of crosses which are defined by are for . The set is a&#10;cross because an element in cannot be strictly below an element of by&#10;the regular increasing order on , and it cannot be strictly above an&#10;element of since it is below and every element of crosses . Moreover&#10;elements of intersect , elements of are not smaller or equal to since&#10;they intersect , and cannot be above since . Therefore is an .&#10;&#10;Since are tame, the chain of crosses with odd indices is tame with&#10;respect to the subsequence of of even indexed pairs. It is also -tame&#10;because the only halfspaces that do not intersect are coming from .">
