<outline text="Introduction" _note="X-ray spectra emitted by Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) of the atoll&#10;class are usually characterized by two states of emission: the soft and&#10;the hard state. During soft states the spectrum can be well described by&#10;a soft thermal component, usually a blackbody or a disk multi-color&#10;blackbody, possibly originated from the accretion disk, and a harder&#10;component, usually a saturated Comptonization spectrum. In some cases, a&#10;hard power-law tail has been detected in the spectra of these sources&#10;during soft states both in Z sources , and in atoll sources , usually&#10;interpreted as Comptonization off a non-thermal population of electrons.&#10;On the other hand, during hard states the hard component of the spectrum&#10;can be described by a power law with high energy cutoff, interpreted as&#10;unsaturated Comptonization, and a weaker soft blackbody component . The&#10;hard component is generally explained in terms of inverse Compton&#10;scattering of soft photons, coming from the neutron star surface and/or&#10;the inner accretion disk, by hot electrons present in a corona possibly&#10;located in the inner part of the system, surrounding the compact object&#10;.&#10;&#10;In addition to the continuum, broad emission lines in the range 6.4-6.97&#10;keV are often observed in the spectra of LMXBs . These lines are&#10;identified as K transitions of iron at different ionization states and&#10;are thought to originate from reflection of the primary Comptonization&#10;spectrum over the accretion disk. These features are powerful tools to&#10;investigate the structure of the accretion flow close to the central&#10;source. In particular, important information can be inferred from the&#10;line width and profile, since the detailed profile shape is determined&#10;by the ionization state, geometry and velocity field of the emitting&#10;plasma . Indeed, when the primary Comptonization spectrum illuminates a&#10;colder accretion disk, other low-energy discrete features (such as&#10;emission lines and absorption edges) are expected to be created by&#10;photoionization and successive recombination of abundant elements in&#10;different ionizations states as well as a continuum emission caused by&#10;direct Compton scattering of the primary spectrum off the accretion&#10;disk. All these features together form the so-called reflection&#10;spectrum, and the whole reflection spectrum is smeared by the&#10;velocity-field of the matter in the accretion disk.&#10;&#10;Ser X-1 is a persistent accreting LMXB classified as an atoll source,&#10;that shows type I X-ray bursts. The source was discovered in 1965 by .&#10;firstly discovered type-I X-ray bursts from this source that was&#10;therefore identified as an accreting neutron star. Besides type-I bursts&#10;with typical duration of few seconds , a super-burst of the duration of&#10;about 2 hours has also been reported . Recently , analyzing spectra&#10;collected by GTC, detected a two-hours periodicity. They tentatively&#10;identified this periodicity as the orbital period of the binary and&#10;hence proposed that the secondary star might be a main sequence K-dwarf.&#10;&#10; have performed a survey of LMXBs carried out with the ASCA satellite.&#10;The best-fit model used by these authors to fit the spectrum of Ser X-1&#10;was a blackbody plus a cutoff power-law with a Gaussian iron line. have&#10;analyzed two simultaneous observations of this source collected with&#10;BeppoSAX and RXTE. The authors fitted the broad-band (0.1-200 keV)&#10;BeppoSAX spectrum with a model consisting of a disk blackbody, a&#10;reflection component described by the XSPEC model [`p`exrav]{}, and a&#10;Gaussian line. However, in that case the improvement in with respect to&#10;a model consisting of a blackbody, a Comptonization spectrum modeled by&#10;compST, and a Gaussian was not significant, and therefore it was not&#10;possible to draw any definitive conclusion about the presence of a&#10;reflection continuum.&#10;&#10; carried out the analysis of three XMM-NEWTON observations of this&#10;system. They managed to fit the EPIC/pn spectrum with a model consisting&#10;of disk blackbody, a Comptonization continuum modeled with [`c`ompTT]{}&#10;and a [`d`iskline]{}, i.e. a Gaussian line distorted and smeared by the&#10;Keplerian velocity field in the accretion disk . They found strong&#10;evidence that the Fe line has an asymmetric profile and therefore that&#10;the line originates from reflection in the inner rim of the accretion&#10;disk. Fitted with a Laor profile , the line shape gave an inner disk&#10;radius of or (depending from the observation) and an inclination angle&#10;to the binary system of . , from data collected by SUZAKU, performed a&#10;study of the iron line profiles in a sample of three LMXBs including&#10;Ser X-1. From the analysis of XIS and PIN spectra, they found a good fit&#10;of the broad-band continuum using a blackbody, a disk blackbody and a&#10;power-law. Two years later re-analyzed XMM-NEWTON and SUZAKU data of a&#10;sample of 10 LMXBs that includes Ser X-1, focusing on the iron line -&#10;reflection emission. In particular, for Ser X-1, they analyzed 4&#10;spectra: three Epic-PN spectra obtained with XMM-NEWTON and one obtained&#10;with the XIS and the PIN instruments on board of SUZAKU. Initially, they&#10;fitted the spectra of the continuum emission using a phenomenological&#10;model, consisting of a blackbody, a disk-blackbody and a power-law.&#10;Then, they started the study of the Fe line adding first a diskline&#10;component and after a reflection component convolved with `rdblur` (that&#10;takes into account smearing effects due to the motion of the emitting&#10;plasma in a Keplerian disk). They obtained different results for the&#10;smearing parameters both for different observations and for different&#10;models used on the same observation. For sake of clarity these results&#10;are summarized in Table \[tab:intro\].&#10;&#10; analyzed two NuSTAR observations carried out on July 2013. They fitted&#10;the continuum emission using a model consisting of a blackbody, a disk&#10;blackbody and a power-law. With respect to this continuum model, evident&#10;residuals were present around 6.40-6.97 keV, suggesting the presence of&#10;a Fe line. Therefore they added a `kerrdisk` component to the continuum&#10;to fit the emission line, taking into account a possible non-null spin&#10;parameter for the neutron star. They also tried to fit the reflection&#10;spectrum (i.e. the iron line and other expected reflection features)&#10;with the self-consistent reflection model `reflionx`, a modified version&#10;of reflionx calculated for a blackbody illuminating spectrum, convolved&#10;with the `kerrconv` component. The addition of the reflection component&#10;gave a significant improvement of the fit. In most cases the best fit&#10;gave low inclination angles (less than ), in agreement with recent&#10;optical observations , inner disk radii compatible with the Innermost&#10;Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), corresponding to about 6 Rg for small&#10;values of the spin parameter, a ionization parameter , and a slight&#10;preference for an enhanced iron abundance. The fit resulted quite&#10;insensitive to the value of the adimensional spin parameter, a, of the&#10;neutron star.&#10;&#10;More recently, analysed a recent 300 ks Chandra/HETGS observation of the&#10;source performed in the “continuous clocking” mode and thus free of&#10;photon pile-up effects. They fitted the continuum with a combination of&#10;multicolor disk blackbody, blackbody and power-law. The iron line was&#10;found significantly broader than the instrumental energy resolution and&#10;fitting this feature with a diskline instead of a broad Gaussian gave a&#10;significant improvement of the fit. They also tried self-consistent&#10;reflection models, namely the reflionx model with a power-law continuum&#10;as illuminating source and xillver , to describe the iron line and other&#10;reflection features, yielding consistent results. In particular, this&#10;analysis gave a inner radius of R and an inclination angle of about 30&#10;deg.&#10;&#10;As described above, different continuum models were used to fit the&#10;spectrum of Ser X-1 observed with various instruments at different&#10;times. In Table \[tab:intro\] we summarize the results of the spectral&#10;analysis of this source obtained from previous studies, and in&#10;particular the results obtained for the iron line and the reflection&#10;model. Quite different values have been reported for the inclination&#10;angle (from less than 10 deg to about 40 deg), for the inner disk radius&#10;(from 4 to more than 100 R) and for the iron line centroid energy and/or&#10;the ionization parameter indicating that the disk is formed by neutral&#10;or very highly ionized plasma.&#10;&#10;In this paper we re-analyzed all the available public NUSTAR&#10;observations of Ser X-1, fitting the iron line and other reflection&#10;features with both phenomenological and self-consistent reflection&#10;models. These data were already analysed by using a different choice of&#10;the continuum and reflection models. We compare these results with those&#10;obtained from three XMM-NEWTON observations fitted with the same models.&#10;We choose to re-analyse NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON spectra because these&#10;instruments provide the largest effective area available to date,&#10;coupled with a moderately good energy resolution, at the iron line&#10;energy, and a good broad-band coverage. Moreover, the source showed&#10;similar fluxes during the NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON observations. Note also&#10;that NUSTAR is not affected by pile-up problems in the whole energy&#10;range. The spectral results obtained for NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON are very&#10;similar to each other and the smearing parameters of the reflection&#10;component are less extreme than those found by , and in good agreement&#10;with the results obtained from the Chandra observation . In particular&#10;we find an inner disk radius in the range and an inclination angle with&#10;respect to the line of sight of .">

<outline text="Observations and Data Reduction" _note="In this paper we analyze data collected by the NUSTAR satellite. Ser X-1&#10;has been observed twice with NUSTAR, obsID: 30001013002 (12-JUL-2013)&#10;and obsID: 30001013004 (13-JUL-2013). The exposure time of each&#10;observation is about 40 ksec. The data were extracted using NuSTARDAS&#10;(NuSTAR Data Analysis Software) v1.3.0. Source data have been extracted&#10;from a circular region with 120“ radius whereas the background has been&#10;extracted from a circular region with 90” radius in a region far from&#10;the source. First, we run the “nupipeline” with default values of the&#10;parameters as we aim to get “STAGE 2” events clean. Then spectra for&#10;both detectors, FPMA and FPMB, were extracted using the “nuproducts”&#10;command. Corresponding response files were also created as output of&#10;nuproducts. A comparison of the FPMA and FPMB spectra, indicated a good&#10;agreement between them. To check this agreement, we have fitted the two&#10;separate spectra with all parameters tied to each other but with a&#10;constant multiplication factor left free to vary. Since the value of&#10;this parameter is , our assumption is basically correct. Following the&#10;same approach described in , we have therefore created a single added&#10;spectrum using the “addascaspec” command. A single response file has&#10;been thus created using “addrmf”, weighting the two single response&#10;matrices by the corresponding exposure time. In this way, we obtain a&#10;summed spectrum for the two NUSTAR observations and the two NUSTAR&#10;modules. We fitted this spectrum in the 3-40 keV energy range, where the&#10;emission from the source dominates over the background.&#10;&#10;We have also used non-simultaneous data collected with XMM-Newton&#10;satellite on March 2004. The considered obsID are 0084020401, 0084020501&#10;and 0084020601. All observations are in Timing Mode and each of them has&#10;a duration of 22 ksec. We extracted source spectra, background spectra&#10;and response matrices using the SAS (Science Analysis Software) v.14&#10;setting the parameters of the tools accordingly. We produced a&#10;calibrated photon event file using reprocessing tools “epproc” and&#10;“rgsproc” for PN and RGS data respectively. We also extracted the MOS&#10;data; these were operated in uncompressed timing mode. However, the&#10;count rate registered by the MOS was in the range c/s, which is above&#10;the threshold for avoiding deteriorated response due to photon pile-up.&#10;The MOS spectra indeed show clear signs of pile-up and we preferred not&#10;to include them in our analysis, since these detectors cover the same&#10;energy range of the PN.&#10;&#10;Before extracting the spectra, we filtered out contaminations due to&#10;background solar flares detected in the 10-12 keV Epic PN light-curve.&#10;In particular we have cut out about 600 sec for obsID 0084020401, about&#10;800 sec for obsID 0084020501 and finally about 1600 sec for obsID&#10;0084020601. In order to remove the flares, we applied time filters by&#10;creating a GTI file with the task “tabgtigen”. In order to check for the&#10;presence of pile-up we have run the task “epatplot” and we have found&#10;significant contamination in each observation. The count-rate registered&#10;in the PN observations was in the range 860-1000 c/s that is just above&#10;the limit for avoiding contamination by pile-up. Therefore, we extracted&#10;the source spectra from a rectangular region (RAW X26) and (RAW X46)&#10;including all the pixels in the y direction but excluding the brightest&#10;columns at RAW X = 35 and RAW X = 36. This reduced significantly the&#10;pile up (pile up fraction below a few percent in the considered energy&#10;range).&#10;&#10;We selected only events with PATTERN 4 and FLAG0 that are the standard&#10;values to remove spurious events. We extracted the background spectra&#10;from a similar region to the one used to extract the source photons but&#10;in a region away from the source included between (RAWX1) and (RAWX6 ).&#10;Finally, for each observation, using the task ’rgscombine’ we have&#10;obtained the added source spectrum RGS1+RGS2, the relative added&#10;background spectrum along with the relative response matrices. We have&#10;fitted RGS spectrum in the 0.35-1.8 keV energy range, whereas the&#10;Epic-PN in the 2.4-10 keV energy range.&#10;&#10;Spectral analysis has been performed using XSPEC v.12.8.1 . For each fit&#10;we have used the `phabs` model in XSPEC to describe the neutral&#10;photoelectric absorption due to the interstellar medium with&#10;photoelectric cross sections from and element abundances from . For the&#10;NUSTAR spectrum, which lacks of low- energy coverage up to 3 keV, we&#10;fixed the value of the equivalent hydrogen column, , to the same value&#10;adopted by , namely N cm , while for the XMM-Newton spectrum we left&#10;this parameter free to vary in the fit, finding a slightly higher value&#10;(see Tab. \[tab:fit\_1\] and \[tab:fit\_2\]). As a further check, we&#10;have fitted the NuSTAR spectrum fixing N to the same value found for the&#10;XMM spectrum, but the fit parameters did not change significantly.">

  <outline text="NUSTAR spectral analysis" _note="The NUSTAR observations caught the source in a high-luminosity ( erg/s,&#10;) state, therefore most probably in a soft state. As seen in other&#10;similar atoll sources, the spectrum of Ser X-1 is characterized by a&#10;soft component (i.e. blackbody), interpreted as thermal emission from&#10;the accretion disk, a hard component (i.e.  a Comptonization spectrum),&#10;interpreted as saturated Comptonization from a hot corona, and often by&#10;the presence of a broad iron emission line at keV depending on the iron&#10;ionization state. We used the Comptonization model `nthComp` in XSPEC,&#10;with a blackbody input seed photon spectrum, to fit the hard component.&#10;We used a simple blackbody to describe the soft component. Substituting&#10;the blackbody with a multicolor disk blackbody, `diskbb` in XSPEC, gives&#10;a similar quality fit and the best-fit parameters do not change&#10;significantly.&#10;&#10;To fit the iron line we first tried simple models such as a Gaussian&#10;profile or a `diskline` . The best-fit parameters, obtained using&#10;alternatively a Gaussian or diskline profile, are in good agreement with&#10;each other (see Tab.\[tab:fit\_1\]). Using a `diskline` instead of a&#10;Gaussian profile we get an improvement of the fit corresponding to for&#10;the addition of two parameters. Spectra, along with the best-fit model&#10;and residuals are shown in Fig.\[fig:fit\_1\]. In both cases, the fit&#10;results are poor (the relative null hypothesis probability is ; the&#10;reduced are still relatively large, and evident residuals are present,&#10;especially above 10 keV, see Fig.\[fig:fit\_1\]).&#10;&#10;In order to fit the residuals at high energy, we added a `powerlaw`&#10;component (a hard tail) to all the models described above. A hard&#10;power-law tail is often required to fit high-energy residuals of atoll&#10;sources in the soft state , and this component may also be present in&#10;the spectrum of Ser X-1 . Unless it is specified otherwise, for every&#10;fit, we froze the power-law photon index to the value found by for Ser&#10;X-1, that is 3.2. The new models are now called GAUSS-PL and&#10;DISKLINE-PL, respectively. The new best fit parameters are reported in&#10;Tab \[tab:fit\_1\]. While the best-fit parameters do not change&#10;significantly with the addition of this component, we get an improvement&#10;of the fit corresponding to a reduction of the by (for the model with a&#10;Gaussian line profile) and (for the model with a diskline profile) for&#10;the addition of one parameter, respectively. The probabilities of chance&#10;improvement of the fit are and , respectively. Some residuals are still&#10;present between 10 and 20 keV probably caused by the presence of an&#10;unmodeled Compton hump. Note that the soft blackbody component remains&#10;significant even after the addition of the power-law component. If we&#10;eliminate this component from the fitting model we get a worse fit,&#10;corresponding to a decrease by for the addition of two parameters when&#10;the soft component is included in the fit and a probability of chance&#10;improvement of the fit of .">

  <outline text="Reflection models" _note="We have also tried to fit the NUSTAR spectrum of Ser X-1 with more&#10;sophisticated reflection models, performing a grid of fit with&#10;self-consistent models such as `reflionx` or `rfxconv`. Reflionx and&#10;rfxconv models both include the reflection continuum, the so called&#10;Compton hump caused by direct Compton scattering of the reflected&#10;spectrum, and discrete features (emission lines and absorption edges)&#10;for many species of atoms at different ionization stages .&#10;&#10;The `reflionx` model depends on 5 parameters, that are the abundance of&#10;iron relative to the solar value, the photon index of the illuminating&#10;power-law spectrum (, ranging between 1.0 to 3.0), the normalization of&#10;reflected spectrum, the redshift of the source, and the ionization&#10;parameter where is the X-ray luminosity of the illuminating source, is&#10;the electron density in the illuminated region and is the distance of&#10;the illuminating source to the reflecting medium. When using `reflionx`,&#10;which uses a power-law as illuminating spectrum, in order to take into&#10;account the high-energy roll over of the Comptonization spectrum, we&#10;have multiplied it by a high-energy cutoff, `highecut`, with the folding&#10;energy E set to 2.7 times the electrons temperature kT and the cutoff&#10;energy E tied to 0.1 keV. In this way we introduce a cutoff in the&#10;reflection continuum, which otherwise resembles a power-law. The cut-off&#10;energy fixed at 2.7 times the electron temperature of the Comptonization&#10;spectrum (assumed to be similar to a blackbody spectrum), is appropriate&#10;for a saturated Comptonization . To fit the Comptonization continuum we&#10;used the `nthComp` model. Moreover we fixed the photon index of the&#10;illuminating spectrum, , to that of the `nthComp` component. We stress&#10;that in our analysis we use a different `reflionx` reflection model with&#10;respect to that used by . In fact we used a model that assumes an input&#10;power-law spectrum as the source of the irradiating flux modified, in&#10;order to mimic the nthcomp continuum, by introducing the model component&#10;`highecut`. instead used a modified version of reflionx calculated for a&#10;blackbody input spectrum, since that component dominates their&#10;phenomenological continuum.&#10;&#10;`rfxconv` is an updated version of the code in , using reflection&#10;tables. This is a convolution model that can be used with any input&#10;continuum and has therefore the advantage to take as illuminating&#10;spectrum the given Comptonization continuum. It depends on 5 parameters:&#10;the relative reflection fraction (rel-refl defined as , namely as the&#10;solid angle subtended by the reflecting disk as seen from the&#10;illuminating corona in units of ), the cosine of the inclination angle,&#10;the iron abundance relative to the Solar value, the ionization parameter&#10;Log of the accretion disk surface, and the redshift of the source.&#10;&#10;Due to its high velocities, the radiation re-emitted from the plasma&#10;located in the inner accretion disk undergoes to Doppler and&#10;relativistic effects (which smears the whole reflection spectrum). In&#10;order to take these effects into account we have convolved the&#10;reflection models with the `rdblur` component (the kernel of the&#10;diskline model), which depends on the values of the inner and outer disk&#10;radii, in units of the Gravitational radius (), the inclination angle of&#10;the disk (that was kept tied to the same value used for the reflection&#10;model), and the emissivity index, Betor, that is the index of the&#10;power-law dependence of the emissivity of the illuminated disk (which&#10;scales as ). Finally, we have also considered the possibility that&#10;neutron star has a spin. In this case, the reflection component has been&#10;convolved with the `Kerrconv` component that through its adimensional&#10;spin parameter ’a’ allowed us to implement a grid of models exploring&#10;different values of ’a’ (see Appendix \[sec:appen\]). For this model&#10;there is also the possibility to fit the emissivity index of the inner&#10;and outer part of the disk independently, although in our fits we used&#10;the same emissivity index for the whole disk. For all the fits we have&#10;fixed the values of R to 2400 , the iron abundance to solar value,&#10;Fe/solar = 1, and the redshift of the source to 0. The best fit&#10;parameters are reported in Tab \[tab:fit\_1\]–\[tab:fit\_4\].&#10;&#10;We started to fit the data adding a reflection component, `reflionx` or&#10;`rfxconv`, convolved with the blurring component `rdblur`, to the&#10;continuum model given by the blackbody and the nthcomp components&#10;(models are called RDB-REFLIO and RDB-RFXCONV, respectively). Fit&#10;results for both models are acceptable, with close to 1.09. There are a&#10;few differences between the best-fit parameters of the rdb-reflio model&#10;with respect to those of the rdb-rfxconv model. In particular the&#10;RDB-RFXCONV model gives a lower value of R, while the RDB-REFLIO model&#10;gives a higher ionization parameter (although with a large uncertainty).&#10;Spectra, along with the best-fit model and residuals are reported in&#10;Fig.\[fig:fit\_1\]. The residuals that are very similar for the two&#10;models, apart for the 8-10 keV energy range where RDB-REFLIO model shows&#10;flatter residuals than RDB-RFXCONV model (see Fig. \[fig:fit\_1\]).&#10;&#10;As before, we also tried to add a power-law component to the models&#10;obtained by the convolution of the blurring component (rdblur) with the&#10;two different reflection components (rfxconv or reflionx). The two new&#10;models are called RDB-RFXCONV-PL and RDB-REFLION-PL, respectively. In&#10;both cases we get a significant improvement of the fit, with for the&#10;addition of two parameters and for the addition of one parameter,&#10;respectively. In these cases, an F-test yields a probability of chance&#10;improvement of for RDB-REFLION-PL and for RDB-RFXCONV-PL model,&#10;respectively. Spectra, along with best-fit model and residuals are&#10;reported in Fig. \[fig:fit\_2\], whereas values of the best-fit&#10;parameters are listed in Tab. \[tab:fit\_2\]. Residuals are now flat&#10;(see plots reported in upper panels of Fig. \[fig:fit\_2\]). Note also&#10;that in this way we get more reasonable values of the best-fit&#10;parameters, especially for the ionization parameter, , which is around&#10;2.7 for both models, in agreement with the centroid energy of the iron&#10;line at about 6.5 keV, and well below 3.7 (a ionization parameter would&#10;imply that the matter of the accretion disk would be fully ionized).&#10;&#10;In summary, the best fit of the NUSTAR spectrum of Ser X-1 is obtained&#10;fitting the continuum with a soft blackbody component, a Comptonization&#10;spectrum, and a hard power-law tail and fitting the reflection features&#10;with the `rfxconv` model smeared by the `rdblur` component, since the&#10;fitting results are quite insensitive to the value of the spin parameter&#10;a (see Appendix \[sec:appen\]). This fit, corresponding to a , gives a&#10;blackbody temperature of keV, a temperature of the seed photons for the&#10;Comptonization of keV, an electron temperature of the Comptonizing&#10;corona of keV and a photon index of the primary Comptonized component of&#10;, whereas the photon index of the hard power-law tail is steeper, around&#10;3.2. The reflection component gives a reflection amplitude (that is the&#10;solid angle subtended by the accretion disk as seen from the&#10;Comptonizing corona) of and a ionization parameter of . The smearing of&#10;the reflection component gives an inner disk radius of ranging between&#10;10 and 16 , and inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line&#10;of sight of , and the emissivity of the disk scaling as . Note that the&#10;Compton hump is highly significant. To evaluate its statistical&#10;significance we can compare the best fit obtained with the model&#10;diskline-pl with the best fit given by the model rdb-rfxconv-pl (the&#10;main difference between the two models is in fact that rfxconv contains&#10;the reflection continuum and diskline does not). Using rfxconv instead&#10;of diskline we get a decreases of the by for the addition of 1 parameter&#10;and an F-test probability of chance improvement of , which is&#10;statistically significant.">

  <outline text="XMM-Newton Spectral Analysis" _note="We have also carried out the analysis of XMM-NEWTON observations of&#10;Ser X-1. A previous study, based only on the PN data analysis, has been&#10;reported by . We updated the analysis by performing the fit of the RGS&#10;spectra in the 0.35–1.8 keV energy range and the PN spectra in the&#10;2.4–10 keV energy range. Following the same approach used for the&#10;analysis on NUSTAR data, we assumed a continuum model composed of a&#10;blackbody, a hard power-law and the nthComp component. In addition to&#10;the continuum components described above, we have also detected several&#10;discrete features present in all RGS spectra, both in absorption and in&#10;emission that were supposed to be of instrumental origin by . The&#10;energies of the most intense features detected in our spectra lie&#10;between 0.5 keV and 0.75 keV. To fit these features we have therefore&#10;added three additional gaussians to our model: two absorption lines at&#10;0.528 keV and at 0.714 keV, respectively, and one in emission at 0.541&#10;keV. The identification of these lines is not straightforward. The 0.528&#10;keV energy is close to the neutral O K line, expected at a rest frame&#10;energy of 0.524 keV, while the 0.541 keV emission line is close to the&#10;expected energy of the O I edge at 0.538 keV. These two lines may be&#10;therefore instrumental features caused by a miscalibration of the&#10;neutral O edge in the RGS. The other absorption line at 0.714 keV is&#10;close to the O VII absorption edge expected at a rest-frame energy of&#10;0.739 keV. Given that the identification of these lines is uncertain, we&#10;will not discuss them further in the paper. To this continuum we first&#10;added a diskline (model called DISKLINE-PL-XMM, see Table&#10;\[tab:fit\_1\]) to fit the iron line profile. Then we fitted the spectra&#10;substituting the diskline with the self-consistent reflection model that&#10;gave the best fit to the NUSTAR data, that is ’rfxconv’, convolved with&#10;the smearing component ’rdblur’ (model called RDB-RFXCONV-PL-XMM,&#10;results are reported in Table \[tab:fit\_2\]).&#10;&#10;We have performed the fit of the spectrum obtained from these three&#10;observations simultaneously, tying parameters of the RGS with the all&#10;parameters of the PN from the same observation. The spectra of the three&#10;XMM observations are very similar with each other, except for the soft&#10;black body temperature that was left free to vary in different datasets.&#10;Values of the best-fit parameters of the model DISKLINE-PL-XMM result to&#10;be in good agreement with what we have found from the fit of the NUSTAR&#10;spectra with the same model.&#10;&#10;We have also performed the fit with a model including the reflection&#10;component `rfxconv`, called RDB-RFXCONV-PL-XMM. As before, in order to&#10;take into account structures visible in the RGS spectra, we have added&#10;three gaussians to the model. As before we have tied parameters of the&#10;RGS to the corresponding parameters of the PN from the same observation&#10;except for the parameter kT that was left free to vary among the three&#10;observations. Note also that for the these fits the inclination angle is&#10;fixed to the corresponding values we found from the NUSTAR spectra.&#10;Results are reported in Table \[tab:fit\_2\], and are in good agreement&#10;with those obtained for the NUSTAR spectrum.">

<outline text="Discussion" _note="Ser X-1 is a well studied LMXB showing a broad emission line at keV&#10;interpreted as emission from iron at different ionization states and&#10;smeared by Doppler and relativistic effects caused by the fast motion of&#10;matter in the inner accretion disk. Moderately high energy resolution&#10;spectra of this source have been obtained from XMM-NEWTON, SUZAKU,&#10;NUSTAR, and CHANDRA. However, as described in Sec. \[sec:intro\],&#10;spectral results for the reflection component are quite different for&#10;different observations or for different models used to fit the continuum&#10;and/or the reflection component. While spectral differences in different&#10;observations may be in principle justified by intrinsic spectral&#10;variations of the source, differences caused by different continuum or&#10;reflection models should be investigated in detail in order to give a&#10;reliable estimate of the parameters of the system. For instance, in a&#10;recent NUSTAR observation analyzed by , assuming a modified version of&#10;`reflionx` calculated for a black-body input spectrum, the authors&#10;report a significant detection of a smeared reflection component in this&#10;source, from which they derive an inner radius of the disk broadly&#10;compatible with the disk extending to the ISCO (corresponding to 6 Rg in&#10;the case ) and an inclination angle with respect to the line of sight .&#10;On the other hand, , analysing a recent 300 ks CHANDRA/HETGS observation&#10;of the source obtained a high-resolution X-ray spectrum which gave a&#10;inner radius of and an inclination angle of .&#10;&#10;In this paper we analyzed all the available NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON&#10;observations of Ser X-1. These observations have been already analyzed&#10;by and , respectively, who used different continuum and reflection&#10;models and report different results for the reflection component. The&#10;same XMM-NEWTON observations have also been analyzed by who also report&#10;different results for the reflection component, with higher inner disk&#10;radii (between 15 and more than ) and quite low inclinations angles ()&#10;when using a blurred reflection model, and inclination angle between 10&#10;and when using a diskline component to fit the iron line profile (see&#10;Tab. \[tab:intro\] for more details). We have shown that we can fit the&#10;NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON spectra independently with the same continuum&#10;model and with a phenomenological model (i.e. diskline) or a&#10;self-consistent reflection model (i.e. reflionx or rfxconv) for the&#10;reflection component, finding in all our fit similar (compatible within&#10;the associated uncertainties) smearing parameters for the reflection&#10;component.&#10;&#10;To fit these spectra we have used a continuum model composed by a&#10;blackbody component (bbody) and a comptonization continuum (nthcomp),&#10;which has been widely used in literature to fit the spectra of neutron&#10;star LMXBs both in the soft and in the hard state . With respect to the&#10;continuum model used by we have substituted one of the two blackbody&#10;components, the hottest one, with a Comptonization spectrum. Since this&#10;component gives the most important contribution to the source flux,&#10;especially above 5 keV, we have subsequently used this component as the&#10;source of the reflection spectrum. In all our fit the addition of a hard&#10;power-law component, with a photon index significantly improved the fit.&#10;The presence of a hard power-law component is often found in the spectra&#10;of bright LMXBs in the soft state , and has been interpreted as&#10;comptonization of soft photons off a non-thermal population of electrons&#10;.&#10;&#10;To fit the reflection component, which is dominated by a prominent iron&#10;line, we have first used a phenomenological model consisting of a&#10;Gaussian line or a diskline, with a diskline providing a better fit than&#10;a Gaussian profile (cf. fitting results reported in Table&#10;\[tab:fit\_1\]). All the diskline parameters obtained from the fitting&#10;of the NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON spectra are compatible with each other,&#10;except for the line flux which appears to be lower during the XMM-NEWTON&#10;observations.&#10;&#10;In order to fit the reflection spectrum with self-consistent models,&#10;which take into account not only the iron line but also other reflection&#10;features, we have used both `reflionx` and `rfxconv` reflection models.&#10;In both these models, emission and absorption discrete features from the&#10;most abundant elements are included, as well as the reflected continuum.&#10;We have convolved the reflection spectrum with the relativistic smearing&#10;model `rdblur`, taking into account Doppler and relativistic effects&#10;caused by the fast motion of the reflecting material in the inner&#10;accretion disk. We have also investigated the possibility that the&#10;neutron star has a significant spin parameter. We have therefore&#10;performed a grid of fits using the `kerrconv` smearing model, instead of&#10;rdblur, freezing the spin parameter ’a’ at different values: 0, 0.12,&#10;0.14 and letting it free to vary in an additional case (see Appendix&#10;\[sec:appen\] for more details). In agreement with the results reported&#10;by we find that the fit is almost insensitive to the spin parameter but&#10;prefers low values of the spin parameter ().&#10;&#10;The results obtained using `reflionx` or `rfxconv` are somewhat&#10;different in the fits not including the hard power-law component.&#10;However, the reflection and smearing parameters become very similar when&#10;we add this component to the continuum model (cf. results in&#10;Tabs.\[tab:fit\_2\], \[tab:fit\_3\], \[tab:fit\_4\]). The addition of&#10;this component also significantly improves all the fits. We consider as&#10;our best fit model the one including the hard power-law component,&#10;`rfxconv` as reflection component smeared by the `rbdblur` component&#10;(model named `rdb-rfxconv-pl` in Tab.  \[tab:fit\_2\]). The fit of the&#10;XMM-NEWTON spectra with the same model gave values of the parameters&#10;that overall agree with those obtained fitting the NUSTAR spectra. In&#10;this case, we have found values of the ionization parameter log()&#10;ranging between 2.58 and 2.71 (a bit higher, around 3, for the&#10;XMM-NEWTON spectra) and reflection amplitudes between 0.2 and 0.3,&#10;indicating a relatively low superposition between the source of the&#10;primary Comptonization continuum and the disk (a value of 0.3 would be&#10;compatible with a spherical geometry of a compact corona inside an outer&#10;accretion disk). For the smearing parameters of the reflection component&#10;we find values of the emissivity index of the disk ranging from -2.8 to&#10;-2.48, an inner radius of the disk from 10.6 to , and an inclination&#10;angle of the system with respect to the line of sight of . In our&#10;results the inclination angle is higher than that found by (who report&#10;an inclination angle less than ), but is very similar to that estimated&#10;from Chandra spectra (, see . Moreover, the inner disk radius we find is&#10;not compatible with the ISCO. Assuming a for the neutron star, the inner&#10;radius of the disk is located at km from the neutron star center. Note&#10;that this value is compatible to the estimated radius of the emission&#10;region of the soft blackbody component, which is in the range km. We&#10;interpret this component as the intrinsic emission from the inner disk&#10;since this is the coldest part of the system and because the temperature&#10;of the blackbody component appears to be too low to represent a boundary&#10;layer.\&#10;">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="The main aim of this paper is to test the robustness of disk parameters&#10;inferred from the reflection component in the case of neutron star&#10;LMXBs; to this aim we used broad-band, moderately high resolution&#10;spectra of Serpens X-1, a neutron star LMXB of the atoll type with a&#10;very clear reflection spectrum that has been studied with several&#10;instruments. In particular, we have carried out a broad-band spectral&#10;analysis of this source using data collected by NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON&#10;satellites, which have the best sensitivity at the iron-line energy.&#10;These data have been already analyzed in literature. In particular have&#10;analyzed the NUSTAR spectra and have obtained a low inclination angle of&#10;about 8, an inner disk radius compatible with the ISCO, a ionization&#10;parameter between 2.3 and 2.6 along with an iron abundance of about 3.&#10;&#10;In the following we summarize the results presented in this paper:&#10;&#10;We have performed the fitting using slightly different continuum and&#10;reflection models with respect to that used by other authors to fit the&#10;X-ray spectrum of this source. Our the best fit of the NUSTAR spectrum&#10;of Ser X-1 is obtained fitting the continuum with a soft blackbody, a&#10;Comptonization spectrum, a hard power-law tail in addition to the&#10;reflection features. To fit the reflection features present in the&#10;spectrum we used both empirical models and self-consistent reflection&#10;components as `reflionx` and `rfxconv`, as well as two different&#10;blurring components that are `rdblur` and`kerrconv`. From the analysis&#10;carried out using kerrcov we have obtained that our fit is insensitive&#10;to the value assumed by the adimensional spin parameter ’a’, in&#10;agreement with what is found by in their analysis.&#10;&#10;With regard the reflection features, we obtain consistent results using&#10;phenomenological models (such as diskline) or self-consistent models to&#10;fit the NUSTAR spectrum of the source. In particular, the reflection&#10;component gives a reflection amplitude of (where is the solid angle of&#10;the disk as seen from the corona in units of ) and a ionization&#10;parameter of . The smearing of the reflection component gives an inner&#10;disk radius of , an emissivity index of the disk in the range , whereas&#10;the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight&#10;results in the range . We note that the inner disk radius derived from&#10;the reflection component results compatible with the radius inferred&#10;from the soft blackbody component, which results in the range km.&#10;&#10;The analysis of XMM-NEWTON spectra, carried out using the same models&#10;adopted to fit the NUSTAR spectra, gave values of the parameters&#10;compatible to those described above, although the two observations are&#10;not simultaneous. The only differences are the reflection amplitude, ,&#10;which results slightly lower, although still marginally consistent&#10;within the errors, and the ionization parameter, , which results&#10;somewhat higher with respect to the non-simultaneous NUSTAR&#10;observations.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, in this paper we performed an investigation of to which&#10;extent the disk parameters inferred from reflection fitting depend on&#10;the chosen spectral models for both the continuum and the reflection&#10;component. Despite the fact that several authors in previous work have&#10;used basically the same continuum model, the resulting reflection&#10;parameters, such as the inner disk radius, , and the inclination angle&#10;are scattered over a large range of values. In this paper we have&#10;re-analyzed all the available public NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON observations&#10;of Ser X-1, fitting the continuum with a slightly different, physically&#10;motivated model and the iron line with different reflection models. By&#10;performing a detailed spectral analysis of NUSTAR and XMM-NEWTON data of&#10;the LMXB Ser X-1 using both phenomenological and self-consistent&#10;reflection models, and using a continuum model somewhat different from&#10;that used in literature for this source, the best fit parameters derived&#10;from the two spectra are in good agreement between each other. These are&#10;also broad agreement with the findings of although we find values of the&#10;inner disk and the inclination angle that are less extreme. Hence, the&#10;use of broad-band spectra and of self-consistent reflection models,&#10;together with an investigation of the continuum model, are highly&#10;desirable to infer reliable parameters from the reflection component.&#10;&#10;We thank the anonymous referee for useful suggestions which helped to&#10;improve the manuscript.

<outline text="Models including &lt;code&gt;kerrconv&lt;/code&gt;" _note="From the spectral analysis described in Sec. \[sec:spec\], we find that&#10;our best fit obtained using `rdblur` as smearing component gives a soft&#10;blackbody temperature of 0.540.06 keV and a radius of the emitting&#10;region of km, a temperature of the seed photons for the Comptonization&#10;of 0.930.07 keV, an electron temperature of the Comptonizing corona of&#10;2.700.04 keV and a photon index of the primary Comptonized component of&#10;2.170.04, whereas the photon index of the hard power-law tail is&#10;steeper, around 3.2. The reflection component gives a reflection&#10;amplitude of 0.240.04 and a ionization parameter of log() = 2.69.&#10;Finally, the smearing of the reflection component gives an inner disk&#10;radius of R = 13.4 2.8R, compatible with the radius inferred from the&#10;blackbody component, and an emissivity index of the disk equal to&#10;-2.640.16, whereas the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the&#10;line of sight results equal to 27.11.9. The analysis of XMM-NEWTON&#10;spectra, carried out using the same models adopted to fit the NUSTAR&#10;spectra, gave values of the parameters compatible to those described&#10;above, although the two observations are not simultaneous. In particular&#10;in this case we find R 14.2 R, a reflection amplitude of 0.1830.003 and&#10;an ionization parameter of log() = 3.040.11, a temperature of the seed&#10;photons in the range keV, a photon index of the primary Comptonized&#10;component of 2.450.22 keV. In other words, the XMM-NEWTON spectra&#10;independently confirm the results obtained for the NUSTAR spectra.&#10;&#10;In order to check the presence of a non-null spin parameter of the&#10;neutron star, we fitted the NUSTAR spectra using reflection components&#10;convolved with `kerrconv` instead of `rdblur`. Kerrconv convolves the&#10;spectrum with the smearing produced by a kerr disk model. It features&#10;the dimensionless ’a’ parameter that characterize the spin of the&#10;system. We have performed our fit first leaving ’a’ as a free parameter&#10;and then fixing it to the following three values, 0, 0.12, 0.14. The&#10;model with reflionx and ’a’ treated as free parameter is called&#10;KER-REFLIO-AF, whereas for , and the models are called KER-REFLIO-A0,&#10;KER-REFLIO-A012, and KER-REFLIO-A014, respectively. In the same way, the&#10;model with rfxconv and ’a’ treated as free parameter is called&#10;KER-RFXCONV-AF, whereas for , and the models are called KER-RFXCONV-A0,&#10;KER-RFXCONV-A012, and KER-RFXCONV-A014, respectively. All the models fit&#10;the data well; reduced are between 1.08 and 1.18 and residuals are&#10;basically identical . Moreover the best-fit values of all parameters are&#10;very similar to the case with and to the values we get using `rdblur`&#10;instead of `kerrconv`. The fit is therefore insensitive to the spin&#10;parameter, although there is a slight preference of the fit towards low&#10;values (). It is worth noting that in all best fit residuals a feature&#10;is present at about 3.9 keV that could be the resonance line of Ca XIX&#10;(3.9 keV). Moreover, again we observe high energy residuals (above 30&#10;keV) indicating the presence of a hard power-law component. Also in this&#10;case, we get a very large ionization parameter using reflionx.&#10;&#10;To avoid this problem, we therefore added a power-law component to the&#10;model obtained by the convolution of `kerrconv` with the two different&#10;reflection components (reflionx or rfxconv). we considered ’a’ free to&#10;vary or fixed it to three different values (0, 0.12, 0.14). In all the&#10;cases the fits are quite good with values of the reduced from 1.0 to&#10;1.01. Again the addition of the power-law proved to be highly&#10;statistically significant. The F-test probability of chance improvement&#10;for the addition of two parameters is, for instance, and for the&#10;addition of a power-law to the model KER-REFLIO-AF and KER-RFXCONV-AF,&#10;respectively. As before, the fit is quite insensitive to the value&#10;assumed by the spin parameter ’a’. Values of the best-fit parameters are&#10;listed in Tab \[tab:fit\_3\] and \[tab:fit\_4\].&#10;&#10;\&#10;&#10;\&#10;">
