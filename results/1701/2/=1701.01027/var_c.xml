<outline text="Introduction" _note="The observation of Type Ia Supernovae and cosmic microwave background&#10;temperature seems to support a universe undergoing a phase of&#10;accelerated expansion. In a universe composed mostly by matter, this&#10;feature is highly counterintuitive. Therefore to account for the&#10;acceleration, it is common to assume that the universe is made mostly ()&#10;by an exotic component, named dark energy (DE). The DE would have an&#10;equation of state (EoS) , which justifies the present universe dynamics.&#10;In standard cosmology (or CDM model), the DE is mathematically described&#10;as a cosmological constant inserted in the Einstein’s field equations&#10;(FEs). However, the cosmological constant, coincidence and dark matter&#10;problems, missing satellites, hierarchy problem and other shortcomings&#10;(see and references therein) arising from CDM model, yield the&#10;consideration of alternative cosmological models.&#10;&#10;Therefore we are led to search for some kind of matter fields which&#10;generates negative pressure enough to account for the acceleration. A&#10;scalar field which goes slowly down to its potential, making the&#10;potential term to dominate over the kinetic one, can produce sufficient&#10;negative pressure, and such a cosmological scenario is named&#10;“quintessence&quot; (check, for instance, -). As one can see in these&#10;references, it is also common to assume the universe dynamics is ruled&#10;by two, instead of one, scalar fields. In fact, in , such a two scalar&#10;field cosmological scenario has presented some advantages when compared&#10;to the one scalar field models, since it describes not only the&#10;accelerated phase of the universe, but also the phases in which the&#10;expansion decelerates, i.e., those for which the universe is dominated&#10;by radiation and matter.">
