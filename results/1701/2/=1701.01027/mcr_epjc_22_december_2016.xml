    <title>The Starobinsky model within the formalism as a cosmological model</title>
    <abstract>In this paper we derive a cosmological model from the theory of gravity,
for which is the Ricci scalar and is the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor. We consider , with being the Starobinksy model and , with and
constants. We find that from such a functional form, it is possible to
describe the cosmological scenario of a radiation-dominated universe,
which has shown to be a non-trivial feature within the formalism. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The theories of gravity [capozziello/2005,nojiri/2006,nojiri/2008]{} are&#10;an optimistic alternative to the shortcomings General Relativity (GR)&#10;faces as the underlying gravitational theory for a cosmological model&#10;[sola/2015,padmanabhan/2003,jamil/2009]{}. They can account for the&#10;cosmic acceleration , providing a great match between theory and&#10;cosmological observations [amarzguioui/2006,tsujikawa/2008,fay/2007]{},&#10;and also for inflation&#10;[rinaldi/2014,huang/2014,myrzakulov/2015,elizalde/2010,myrzakul/2015,barvinsky/2015,bamba/2015]{}&#10;and dark matter issues .&#10;&#10;One of the crucial troubles surrounding GR is that apparently it cannot&#10;be quantized, although attempts to do so have been proposed, as String&#10;Theory (check also [barbon/2004,brink/2004]{} for reviews on the topic),&#10;and can, in future, provide us a robust and trustworthy model of gravity&#10;- quantum mechanics unification.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile it is worthwhile to attempt to consider the presence of&#10;quantum effects in gravitational theories. Those effects can rise from&#10;the consideration of terms proportional to the trace of the&#10;energy-momentum tensor in the gravitational part of the action, yielding&#10;the gravity theories . Those theories were also motivated by the fact&#10;that although gravity is well behaved in cosmological scales, the Solar&#10;System regime seems to rule out most of the models proposed so far&#10;[erickcek/2006,chiba/2007,capozziello/2007b,olmo/2007]{}.&#10;&#10;Despite its recent elaboration, gravity has already been applied to a&#10;number of areas, such as Cosmology&#10;[mc/2016,ms/2016,mrc/2016,moraes/2015,moraes/2014,moraes/2016,jamil/2012,singh/2014,farasat\_shamir/2015,sahoo/2014,rudra/2015,sharif/2013,reddy/2014,sahoo/2016,houndjo/2014]{}&#10;and Astrophysics&#10;[mmm/2016,mam/2016,amam/2016,zubair/2015,noureen/2015,noureen/2015b]{}.&#10;&#10;By deeply investigating the outcomes and features of an or model, one&#10;realizes the strong relation they have with the functional form of the&#10;chosen functions and free parameter values. In fact, a reliable method&#10;to constraint those “free&quot; parameters to values that yield realistic&#10;models can bee seen in and for and models, respectively.&#10;&#10;In gravity a reliable and reputed functional form was proposed by A.A.&#10;Starobinsky as&#10;&#10;which is known as Starobinsky Model (SM), with a constant. It predicts&#10;quadratic corrections of the Ricci scalar to be inserted in the&#10;gravitational part of the Einstein-Hilbert action. An analysis of matter&#10;density perturbations in SM was presented in [fu/2010]{}. Black hole&#10;studies were made for gravity in [hendi/2011]{}. The consideration of&#10;wormholes in such theories can be appreciated in .&#10;&#10;Our proposal in this paper is to construct a cosmological scenario from&#10;an functional form whose dependence is the same as in the SM, i.e., with&#10;a quadratic extra contribution of , as in Eq.(\[i1\]). The dependence&#10;will be considered to be linear, as , with a constant. Therefore, we&#10;will take&#10;&#10;Despite the high number of considerations of the SM in cosmology (check&#10;also ), it has not been considered for the dependence in models for&#10;cosmological purposes so far, only in the study of astrophysical compact&#10;objects [zubair/2015,noureen/2015,noureen/2015b]{}. We believe this is&#10;due to the expected high nonlinearity of the resulting differential&#10;equation for the scale factor. Anyhow, the consideration of quantum&#10;corrections together with quadratic geometrical terms can imply&#10;interesting outcomes in a cosmological perspective as it did in the&#10;astrophysical level (check [zubair/2015,noureen/2015,noureen/2015b]{}).&#10;Therefore we present here a reliable and well referenced method to&#10;obtain solutions for such a cosmological scenario.&#10;&#10;Here let us stress that the formalism exhibits a sort of shortcoming for&#10;a specific era of the Universe evolution. One could ask what are the&#10;predictions of gravity in the regime . It is natural to think that for&#10;different functional forms formulated to the function, the regime makes&#10;gravity to recover theories. The regime is achieved for , with and being&#10;the pressure and density of the Universe, respectively, which is the&#10;equation of state (EoS) of radiation. Therefore, from a cosmological&#10;perspective it becomes intuitive to think that gravity itself is not&#10;able to describe the era in which the Universe was dominated by&#10;radiation[^1]. It would only recover the outcomes.&#10;&#10;The issue surrounding the formalism was already investigated in . In&#10;[ms/2016]{}, in order to be able to describe the radiation era of the&#10;Universe, a scalar field was invoked in gravity, namely the gravity. In&#10;such a description became possible only in a five-dimensional&#10;space-time, while in the speed of light was considered a variable and an&#10;alternative scenario to inflation was obtained. Here, instead, one of&#10;our goals is to check if restrictively the choice of the SM for the&#10;dependence in the function is able to make formalism to describe a&#10;radiation-dominated universe.&#10;&#10;The SM in formalism is known to successfully describe the accelerated&#10;periods of the Universe evolution, namely the inflationary and dark&#10;energy eras&#10;[starobinsky/2007,kaneda/2016,sebastiani/2015,farakos/2013,ellis/2013,appleby/2010]{}.&#10;Would it also be a powerful tool to help gravity to be able to describe&#10;the radiation era of the Universe? Let us address this question in the&#10;next sections.&#10;&#10;[^1]: In it was deeply discussed that this non-contribution regime of&#10;    gravity can also be expected in vacuum; for instance, in the study&#10;    of gravitational waves propagation.">

<outline text="Analytical solutions for the scale factor and their cosmological consequences" _note="As we can see in the previous section, the equations&#10;(\[fle1\])-(\[fle2\]) are nonlinear second-order differential equations.&#10;It is worth pointing out that nowadays the nonlinearity is found in many&#10;areas of Physics, including Condensed Matter , Field Theory&#10;[2.1,2.2,2.3,2.4]{} and also Cosmology . In a cosmological context, the&#10;nonlinear effects can play an important role to understand the dynamics&#10;of the Universe. For instance, in a recent work it has been shown that&#10;in a cosmological scenario with Lorentz symmetry breaking, the so-called&#10;oscillons in the early Universe have passed through a phase transition&#10;that changed their internal structure .&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, as a consequence of the nonlinearity, in general we lose&#10;the capability of getting the complete solutions. However, in this&#10;section we will show that Equations (\[fle1\])-(\[fle2\]) can be solved&#10;analytically in order to get the general solutions of the system.&#10;&#10;In order to eliminate the explicit dependence on the term , we add the&#10;Eqs.(\[fle1\]) and (\[fle2\]) to conclude that&#10;&#10;It is important to remark that there is no restriction in adding these&#10;equations and that such a mathematical approach was shown to be very&#10;useful . Also, in , it was used in order to find a class of traveling&#10;solitons in Lorentz and CPT breaking systems.&#10;&#10;Now we will focus on getting analytical solutions for Eq.(\[4\]).&#10;Looking at it, it is natural to think that the functions and can be&#10;represented by polynomial functions of third degree in . In fact, such a&#10;representation is constantly used in studies concerning oscillon&#10;theories . In those cases, this mathematical procedure allows to obtain&#10;the fundamental characteristics of the oscillons, such as their field&#10;configuration, lifetime, amplitude and rate of decaying. By using this&#10;approach we will have a specific class of solutions, but with the great&#10;advantage of its analytical form.&#10;&#10;Therefore, with the above motivation, we assume that and are related by&#10;a general polytropic equation of state : In (\[5\]), and are constants.&#10;&#10;By substituting the above form of in Eq.(\[w1\]), we obtain the&#10;following constraints&#10;&#10;where is an arbitrary constant of integration. Moreover, we are using&#10;the following definition It is important to remark that, in order to&#10;avoid singularities, we must impose that .&#10;&#10;On the other hand, by applying Eqs.(\[5\]) and (\[7\]) into (\[4\]), we&#10;find the equation&#10;&#10;where we are using the indentification&#10;&#10;Now, in order to solve Eq.(\[8\]) and consequently find a class of&#10;analytical solutions for the scale factor, we impose that . Thus, we can&#10;see from Eq.(\[8\]) that there are two different roots for , which are&#10;given by&#10;&#10;Thus, after some mathematical manipulations, we can obtain the following&#10;analytical solutions for the scale factor&#10;&#10;where , and are arbitrary constants of integration, with .&#10;&#10;To interpret these solutions, we will construct the referred Hubble and&#10;deceleration parameters. The Hubble parameter, expressed by , shows us&#10;the expansion rate of the Universe in time, whereas the deceleration&#10;parameter, expressed by , is such that negative values stand for an&#10;accelerated expansion while positive values, for a decelerated&#10;expansion.&#10;&#10;Let us start by analysing solution (\[19\]). Such a scale factor evolves&#10;in time according to Fig.\[fig1\] below.&#10;&#10;The referred Hubble parameter reads&#10;&#10;which is depicted in Fig.\[fig2\].&#10;&#10;Moreover, independently of the values of the constants and , Eq.(\[19\])&#10;yields .&#10;&#10;The behaviour of the cosmological parameters , and obtained above are in&#10;agreement with a universe dominated by radiation. In order to verify&#10;this, let us recall that the standard Friedmann equations are obtained&#10;in the present model by making in (\[fle1\])-(\[fle2\]) and read&#10;&#10;In order to make standard Friedmann equations above to describe a&#10;radiation-dominated universe, one usually assumes as the EoS of the&#10;Universe in (\[sfr2\]). Such an assumption yields the solution , exactly&#10;as in Eq.(\[19\]), obtained from the formalism.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Fig.\[fig1\] shows that as . In fact, a null value for&#10;would indicate the origin of the Universe. However, since we are&#10;treating the radiation dominated universe, does not describe the&#10;Big-Bang. Rather, it describes the time in which radiation starts&#10;dominating the Universe dynamics. In this way, the fact that for low&#10;values of time is in agreement with a radiation dominated universe. We&#10;can also see that increases with time, corroborating an expanding&#10;universe.&#10;&#10;The Hubble parameter behaviour of Figure \[fig2\] also strengthens our&#10;argument. Firstly, we can see that it decreases with time, as it should&#10;happen in an expanding universe. Secondly, since , with being the Hubble&#10;time, at the end of the stage in which the Universe dynamics was&#10;dominated by radiation, must be . High values of time in Fig.\[fig2\]&#10;(and also in Fig.\[fig1\]) indicate the end of the radiation era rather&#10;than the present or future epochs of the Universe, in which&#10;asymptotically tends to . Such an asymptotically behaviour for can be&#10;seen, for instance, in , for which high values of time stand for present&#10;and future epochs of the Universe evolution.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the value which we obtained for the deceleration parameter,&#10;i.e., , also is in accordance with a radiation dominated universe. The&#10;fact that it is positive means that during this stage, the Universe&#10;expansion was decelerating (in fact, the expansion started to accelerate&#10;some few billion years ago ). Also, from the time proportionality&#10;obtained for from the standard Friedmann equations above, i.e., , the&#10;deceleration parameter definition yields exactly , i.e., our model has&#10;the same features of a standard cosmology radiation-dominated universe.&#10;&#10;Now, using Eq.(\[20\]), we find the following results for the&#10;cosmological parameters&#10;&#10;The evolution of these quantities in time can be appreciated in&#10;Figs.\[fig4\]-\[fig5\] below.&#10;&#10;The cosmological model constructed from Eq.(\[20\]) is quite more&#10;general than the one presented earlier. This feature can easily be&#10;checked by investigating Fig.\[fig5\]. For different values of the&#10;constants involved, departs from , which stands for a&#10;radiation-dominated era. As time passes by, assumes the value , which is&#10;the deceleration parameter of a matter-dominated universe. This can be&#10;checked by taking in Eq.(\[sfr2\]). Fig.\[fig5\] also shows that the&#10;model predicts a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase&#10;of expansion of the Universe, since the deceleration parameter&#10;eventually assumes negative values. These values are in agreement with&#10;observations, as one can check, for instance, the 192 ESSENCE SNe Ia&#10;data .">

<outline text="Discussion" _note="It is known that for a small but non-negligible period of time the&#10;dynamics of the early universe was dominated by radiation. During this&#10;epoch, the density and temperature of photons were high enough to&#10;prevent atoms, (and consequently) stars and galaxies to form.&#10;&#10;In such a stage, the EoS of the Universe is written as . For a perfect&#10;fluid, such an EoS yields a null trace of the energy-momentum tensor and&#10;therefore one expects, in this regime, gravity to simply retrieve&#10;gravity. Indeed, no contributions from the former are expected since the&#10;dependence on disappears.&#10;&#10;Such an formalism shortcoming has generated some important discussions.&#10;In , in order to surpass such an unpleasant feature, the authors have&#10;formulated a cosmological scenario for the gravity, with being a scalar&#10;field. They have showed that even in the regime , the field equations of&#10;the model present extra contributions, when compared to those from&#10;gravity, coming from the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the&#10;scalar field. Such a formalism originated the possibility of studying&#10;gravitational waves in gravity (recall that the regime is also obtained&#10;in vacuum).&#10;&#10;Here, instead, we have proposed a quadratic correction for the&#10;-dependence of the function. Motivated by the application of the SM in&#10;cosmology [starobinsky/2007,goswami/2013,nojiri/2015,abebe/2016]{} and&#10;astrophysics , we intended here to check if from the theory, one could&#10;derive a healthy cosmological scenario.&#10;&#10;In constructing our model, we have obtained a highly nonlinear set of&#10;differential equations for the scale factor , from which important and&#10;informative cosmological parameters are obtained.&#10;&#10;Remarkably, for small values of time, the values of our scale factor&#10;solution presented in Fig.\[fig1\] are not close to . The restriction of&#10;this model to the radiation era of the Universe can be checked also in&#10;Fig.\[fig2\], in which we can see that for high values of time (end of&#10;radiation era) the Hubble parameter does not tends asymptotically to ,&#10;which is expected in a recent universe (check, for instance, ).&#10;&#10;We have presented from solution (\[19\]) a formalism which makes gravity&#10;able to generate a cosmological scenario in which radiation dominates&#10;the dynamics of the Universe. The relevance of such a construction lies&#10;on the fact that one does not expect gravity to be capable of describing&#10;such a stage of the Universe without simply recovering gravity. Here,&#10;instead, we have shown that besides predicting a variety of well behaved&#10;cosmological and astrophysical scenarios in gravity, the SM within the&#10;gravity solves the issue of theories.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, solution (\[20\]) is related to a more complete&#10;cosmological scenario. It predicts, from the analysis of the referred&#10;deceleration parameter, the radiation, matter and dark energy-dominated&#10;eras, as well as the transition among these stages, in a continuous&#10;form, which is certainly a milestone in theoretical cosmology.&#10;&#10;PHRSM would like to thank São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), grant&#10;2015/08476-0, for financial support.
