    <title>Is the colour-octet mechanism consistent with the double production
measurement at B-factories?</title>
    <abstract>Double production in collisions involving colour-octet channels are
evaluated up to order . Having implemented the variation of the
parameters (, and long-distance matrix elements), we found that the
cross sections for producing double at B-factories range from fb to fb,
which are even much smaller than that via the colour-siglet mechanism.
Accordingly, this result is consistent with the measurement by the Belle
and BABAR Collaborations. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The phenomenological study on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective&#10;theory  is making new progress since the LHC started its running.&#10;Copious data not only provides evidences for the colour-octet (CO)&#10;mechanism, but also indicates challenges to the theory. In addition to&#10;the fact that the hadroproduction data can be well reproduced by the&#10;theoretical evaluations within the NRQCD framework , hadroproduction &#10;gives another strong support. In low transverse momentum () region, even&#10;though the factorization might not hold, the colour-glass-condensate&#10;model  associated with NRQCD  did a good job in the description of the&#10;production in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions . Despite all&#10;the successes, we can not overlook the challenges it is facing. The&#10;universality of the NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) has not&#10;yet been suggested in all the processes. As an example, the constraint &#10;on the CO LDMEs indicated by the QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) study&#10;on the production at B factories is apparently below the LDME values&#10;obtained through the fit of the production data at other colliders . The&#10;perspectives of the long-standing polarization puzzle still have not&#10;converged. Three groups  achieved the calculation of the polarization at&#10;hadron colliders at QCD NLO; however, with different LDMEs, their&#10;results are complete different from one another. Recently, the&#10;hadroproduction was measured by the LHCb Collaboration , which provides&#10;another laboratory for the study of NRQCD. Ref.  considers it as a&#10;challenge to NRQCD, while Refs.  found these data are consistent with&#10;the hadroproduction measurements. Further, with the constraint on the&#10;LDMEs obtained in Ref. , Ref.  discovered some interesting features of&#10;the polarization, and found a possibility of understanding the&#10;polarization within the NRQCD framework.&#10;&#10;The pair production at B factories is another challenge that NRQCD is&#10;facing. Belle  and BABAR  Collaborations observed the process&#10;Charmonium, and found no evidence for the pair events, while the QCD&#10;leading order (LO) calculation based on the colour-siglet (CS) mechanism&#10;predicted a significant production rate . This was understood by the QCD&#10;NLO corrections , which contribute a negative value and cancel the large&#10;LO cross sections. Ref.  only talked about the CS contributions.&#10;However, the Belle and BABAR measurements actually did not exclude the&#10;double plus light hadron events. Both of the experiments measured the&#10;spectrum, where denotes the invariant mass of all the final states&#10;except for the fully reconstructed . These distributions exhibited no&#10;significant excess in the range of about 300 MeV above the mass, which&#10;suggested that the cross section for the pair plus light hadron (e.g. ,&#10;) associated production is also too small to observe. To accord with&#10;NRQCD, the double production cross sections involving the CO channels&#10;must not be significant, which, however, is not manifest. Although&#10;suppressed by the CO LDMEs, the double yield due to the CO mechanism is&#10;enhanced by the powers of , relative to via the CS channels. As is&#10;pointed out in Refs. , at B factories, double can be produced via two&#10;virtual photons generated through the annihilation, and the LO&#10;contribution is of order . In contrast, as illustrated in&#10;FIG.(\[diagram-a\], \[diagram-b\], and \[diagram-c\]), the diagrams for&#10;the processes e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(m\_1)+c|[c]{}(m\_2), \[eqn:process1\] when&#10;and have the opposite charge conjugation, involve only a single virtual&#10;photon, and the LO contribution is of order . For double production, and&#10;have only two possible configurations, which are and , and and . These&#10;two processes are suppressed by the CO LDMEs by a factor of , where is&#10;the typical charm-quark velocity in the charmonium rest frame, however,&#10;enhanced by the coupling constants by a factor of , relative to via the&#10;CS channels. The double can also be produced through such kind of&#10;processes, e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(n\_1)+c|[c]{}(n\_2)+g, \[eqn:process2\] where&#10;denotes a gluon. When and (or equivalently and ), this kind of processes&#10;are enhanced by the coupling constants by a factor of and reduced by the&#10;CO LDME by a factor of , relative to the processes involving only the CS&#10;channels. In sum, the processes involving CO states are enhanced by a&#10;synthetic factor of about , comparing with the processes considered in&#10;Refs. , the LO cross sections of which is large enough to be observed by&#10;Belle and BABAR experiments. Accordingly, we need to calculate the cross&#10;sections for the pair production involving the CO channels to see&#10;whether NRQCD can endure this paradox.&#10;&#10;In this work, we will present a comprehensive study on the double&#10;production in annihilation involving CO channels up to order , and check&#10;whether it is consistent with the meausurements by Belle and BABAR&#10;Collaborations. The plus production at B factories has already been&#10;studied in Refs. , and their results do not contradict the double&#10;measurements by Belle and BABAR Collaborations, regarding the branching&#10;ratios , 33.9, 19.2 . In this paper, we do not calculate the production.&#10;We also notice that the may come from the feed down, where the can be&#10;produced via the channel. By employing the LDMEs obtained in Refs. , and&#10;in association with the branching ratios listed above, we find that this&#10;contribution is much smaller than that from the directly produced&#10;through the channel. Similarly, the production cross sections via the&#10;feed down is also smaller than that for the directly produced ones. For&#10;this reason, we completely omit the discussions on the feed down&#10;contributions from both and .&#10;&#10;The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Sec.\[cha:2\], we&#10;outline the formalism of the calculation. Sec.\[cha:3\] presents the&#10;numerical results and related discussions, followed by a concluding&#10;remark in Sec.\[cha:4\].">

<outline text="Double  production in NRQCD framework" _note="Following the NRQCD factorization, the total cross sections for the pair&#10;production can be expressed as&#10;(e\^+e\^-J/+J/+X)=\_[n\_1,n\_2]{}(e\^+e\^-c(n\_1)+c(n\_2)+X)O\^[J/]{}(n\_1)O\^[J/]{}(n\_2),&#10;\[eqn:total\] where , run over all the possible configurations of the&#10;intermediate states with certain colour and angular momentum, is the&#10;short-distance coefficient (SDC), and and are the corresponding LDMEs.&#10;When at least one of and is a CO state, the LO contributions are of&#10;order . At this order, all the processes have the form of&#10;Eq.(\[eqn:process1\]), in which the only possible configurations of and&#10;are , and , , and the representative Feynman diagrams are illustrated in&#10;Fig.(\[diagram-a\], \[diagram-b\], and \[diagram-c\]). At QCD NLO (), in&#10;addition to the virtual corrections (the representative Feynman diagrams&#10;for which are shown in Fig.(\[diagram-d\], \[diagram-e\], and&#10;\[diagram-f\])) to the processes presented in Eq.(\[eqn:process1\]),&#10;double states in association with a gluon production is also required&#10;for consideration, as illustrated in Eq.(\[eqn:process2\]). The&#10;real-correction processes to the LO ones are&#10;e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+g,\&#10;e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+g,&#10;\[eqn:process2a\] in addition to which, five processes are also at this&#10;order, as listed below, and will be calculated in our paper.&#10;e\^+e\^-c(\^3S\_1\^[\[1\]]{})+ c(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+g,&#10;\[eqn:process2b1\]\&#10;e\^+e\^-c(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+ c(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+g,&#10;\[eqn:process2b2\]\&#10;e\^+e\^-c(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+ c(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+g,&#10;\[eqn:process2b3\]\&#10;e\^+e\^-c(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+ c(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+g,&#10;\[eqn:process2b4\]\&#10;e\^+e\^-c(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+ c(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+g.&#10;\[eqn:process2b5\] The representatvie Feynman diagrams for the&#10;final-state-gluon-emission processes are presented in&#10;Fig.(\[diagram-g\], \[diagram-h\], and \[diagram-i\]). However, not all&#10;the processes have the three types of diagrams. So, we summarize the&#10;possible diagrams for each of the processes in Table\[tab:diag\].&#10;&#10;\[tab:diag\]&#10;&#10;\&#10;\&#10;\&#10;&#10;Before we present the numerical results, we first address the&#10;divergences rising from the processes listed above. First of all, the LO&#10;processes are divergence free, and we denote their total cross sections&#10;as . The virtual corrections to contain both ultraviolet (UV) and&#10;infrared (IR) divergences. The UV divergences can be eliminated through&#10;the renormalization precedure, while the IR divergences will be canceled&#10;by those emerging in the real corrections, the processes for which are&#10;presented in Eq.(\[eqn:process2a\]). We denote the renormalized&#10;virtual-correction total cross sections as , and the real corrections to&#10;as . The complete QCD NLO corrections to can be expressed as&#10;\^[NLO]{}\^V+\^R=\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{}+\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{},&#10;\[eqn:csnlo\] where&#10;\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{}=\^V\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{}+\^R\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{},\&#10;\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{}=\^V\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{}+\^R\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{}.&#10;\[eqn:csnlo2\] Both and are divergence free. The total cross sections&#10;for the pair production through and channels are the sum of their LO and&#10;NLO contributions.&#10;\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{}=\^[LO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{}+\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}]{},\&#10;\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{}=\^[LO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{}+\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{}+\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{}]{}.&#10;\[eqn:completecsdiv\] Note that we adopt the on-shell (OS)&#10;renormalization scheme for the renormalization of c-quark mass and the&#10;wave functions of the c-quark and gluon, and&#10;modified-mininum-subtraction () scheme for that of the QCD coupling&#10;constant, which are coincide with Ref. . The corresponding&#10;renormalization constants, (for the c-quark mass), (for the c-quark wave&#10;function), (for the gluon wave function), and (for the QCD coupling&#10;constant), are &amp;&amp;Z\^[OS]{}\_[m]{}=-3C\_[F]{}\[-\_[E]{}++\],\&#10;&amp;&amp;Z\^[OS]{}\_[2]{}=-C\_[F]{}\[+-3\_[E]{}+3+4\],\&#10;&amp;&amp;Z\^[OS]{}\_[3]{}=\[(’\_[0]{}-2C\_[A]{})(-)-T\_F(-\_[E]{}+)\],\&#10;&amp;&amp;Z\^\_[g]{}=-\[-\_[E]{}+(4)\], where is the renormalization scale, is&#10;Euler’s constant, is the one-loop coefficient of the QCD beta function,&#10;is the number of active quark flavors. In SU(3), color factors are given&#10;by , , , and , where is the number of light quark flavors. Actually, in&#10;the NLO total amplitude level, the terms proportion to cancel each&#10;other; thus the result is independent of the renormalization scheme of&#10;the gluon field. The cross sections for the processes listed in&#10;Eq.(\[eqn:process2b4\] and \[eqn:process2b5\]) also have divergences,&#10;which, however, can be eliminated through the renormalization of the&#10;SDCs for them. We take process \[eqn:process2b4\] as an example. The&#10;cancellation of its divergences requires the calculation of the NLO&#10;corrections to . The bare LDME can be expressed as&#10;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})\_[bare]{}=O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})-&#10;(-)O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[\[8\]]{}), \[eqn:ldmenlo\] where is the c-quark&#10;mass, and for SU(3) gauge theory. Here we adopt the -cutoff&#10;renormalization scheme  to subtract the UV divergence. By substituting&#10;the relation between the bare and renormalized LDMEs,&#10;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})\_[bare]{}&amp;=&amp;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})\_[renorm]{}+\&#10;&amp;&amp;(-\_E++ln())O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[\[8\]]{}), \[eqn:renormldme\] into&#10;Eq.(\[eqn:ldmenlo\]), we obtain the renormalized LDME as&#10;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})\_[renorm]{}&amp;=&amp;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})-\&#10;&amp;&amp;(-\_E++ln())O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[\[8\]]{}). \[eqn:ldmerenorm\] Then&#10;process contribute an additional divergent term&#10;\_[div]{}(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}))=-(-\_E++ln())\&#10;(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{}))O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[\[8\]]{}),&#10;\[eqn:sigmadiv\] which cancels the IR sigularities rising from process&#10;\[eqn:process2b4\]. In this sense, we can redefine the SDC for process&#10;\[eqn:process2b4\] as&#10;\_[renorm]{}(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+g)=(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+g)\&#10;-(-\_E++ln())(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})),&#10;\[eqn:sdcfinite\] where&#10;(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[\[8\]]{})+g)=(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+g)\&#10;+3(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_1\^[\[8\]]{})+g)+5(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[\[8\]]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_2\^[\[8\]]{})+g)&#10;\[eqn:def3pj8\] has been implicated in Eq.(\[eqn:sdcfinite\]) (the same&#10;convention applies to the SDCs with the subscript “renorm”). is a finite&#10;quantity, therefore, we can replace, in Eq.(\[eqn:total\]), the&#10;divergent one by it. The same operation can be done for process&#10;\[eqn:process2b5\] as well. Then, we denote all the divergence-free&#10;total cross sections for the processes listed in Eq.(\[eqn:process2b1\],&#10;\[eqn:process2b2\], \[eqn:process2b3\], \[eqn:process2b4\],&#10;\[eqn:process2b5\]) as , where and are the corresponding states.">

<outline text="Numerical results" _note="In our analytic calculation, we use our [MATHEMATICA]{} package with the&#10;employment of FeynArts , FeynCalc , FIRE  and Apart . As a cross check,&#10;we also compute the processes using the FDC package , except for process&#10;\[eqn:process2b5\]. To subtract the IR divergences in the gluon-emission&#10;processes, we adopt the two-cutoff slicing strategy . The independence&#10;of the cutoff has been checked.&#10;&#10;We have the following global choices of the parameters in our&#10;calculation: , and the colliding energy of the electron and positron is&#10;. The mass is fixed to to keep the gauge invariance. The default values&#10;of and the renormalization scale () are and , respectively. Since we&#10;investigate the dependence of the total cross sections, the two-loop&#10;running is employed in our computation. The values of the SDCs for all&#10;the processes are listed in Table \[tab:sdc\], where the SDCs for the&#10;channels are defined by multiplying a factor of to those defined in&#10;Ref. , in order to keep the homogeneity of the dimensions (for double&#10;production, this factor should be ).

Note that the two processes&#10;which are symmetric in the sense of switching and are only counted once&#10;to avoid the double counting. We obtain this value as . Compared with&#10;the results obtained in Ref. , it is even smaller than that via the CS&#10;channels up to QCD NLO.&#10;&#10;To investigate the uncertainties brought in by the two scales, we vary&#10;from 1.2 to 1.7 and from to and calculate the corresponding total cross&#10;sections. When one of these scales varies its value, the other is fixed.&#10;Note that the LDMEs used in our calculation are obtained with the&#10;configuration .

We can see that the and channels provide the largest&#10;contributions, while the others contribute smaller with visible&#10;hierachy. Expecially, both the and cross sections are negative . The&#10;total cross section increases from about 0.08 to about 0.12 fb as the&#10;increases from to . The dependence of the total cross section is&#10;presented in Fig.\[fig:miu\], and the decreases from 0.104 to 0.08 as&#10;increases from to . The dependence on the two scales is not severe,&#10;which indicates good convergence of the perturbative expansion.&#10;&#10;Since there are several parallel extractions of the LDMEs, we need to&#10;investigate the uncertainties brought in by the different values of&#10;them. As is shown in TABLE\[tab:ldme\], the total cross sections&#10;obtained by using the LDMEs in Ref.  are almost twice of ours, however,&#10;still too small to be observed by the experiment.">
