    <title>Medium modification of averaged jet charge in heavy-ion collisions</title>
    <abstract>Jet charge characterizes the electric charge distribution inside a jet.
In this talk we make the first theoretical study of jet charge in
high-energy nuclear collisions and calculate numerically the medium
alternations of jet charge due to parton energy loss in the quark-gluon
plasma. The parton multiple scattering in hot/dense QCD medium is
simulated by a modified version of PYQUEN Monte Carlo model with 3+1D
ideal hydrodynamical evolution of the fireball. Our preliminary results
show that the averaged jet charge is significant modified in A+A
collisions relative to that in p+p. The different features of quark jet
charge and gluon jet charge in heavy-ion collisions, and the sensitivity
of jet charge modifications to flavour dependence of energy loss are
observed, which could then be used to discriminate quark and gluon jet
as well as their energy loss patterns in heavy-ion collisions. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="One very important purpose of high energy heavy-ion collisions performed&#10;at RHIC and LHC is to study the creation and the properties of&#10;Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a new form of matter with deconfined quarks&#10;and gluons created during these collisions. It has been shown that the&#10;jet quenching, or the energy loss of a fast parton traversing the nuclei&#10;could be used a very sensitive probe to calibrate the density and&#10;temperature of the QCD matter . The attenuation of parton energy loss&#10;will engender the suppression of leading hadrons  as well as&#10;alternations of full jet observables in the high-energy nuclear&#10;collisions such as jet shapes and fragmentation functions , single jet&#10;cross section , di-jet transverse momentum asymmetry  and tagged jet&#10;imbalance , [ETC]{}.&#10;&#10;With the advance of expereimental measurements and theoretical&#10;calculations of jet quenching, it is of importance to explore the jet&#10;quenching effect on new full jet observable with distinct features. A&#10;very interesting jet observable is jet charge, which gives the electric&#10;charge distribution in a recosntructed jet and was firstly proposed by&#10;Field and Feynman almost forty years ago . This observable has been&#10;investigated experimentally in deep inelastic scattering studies to&#10;understand the correlation between the quark model and hadrons. Since&#10;then, jet charge observables have been utilized in tagging the charge of&#10;b-quark jets, hadronically decaying bosons, and distinguishing quark&#10;jets from gluon jets . Recently, ATLAS Collaboration published their&#10;measurement of jet charge in dijet events in  TeV p+p collisions . In&#10;this talk we make a first theoretical investigatation of jet charge in&#10;relativistic heavy-ion collisions and see its medium modification in&#10;relative to hadronic collisions . We show that parton energy loss of the&#10;energetic partons in the QGP will change the electric charge&#10;distributions in a full jet and demonstrate the obvious distinction&#10;between quark and gluon jet charges, which can be used as a excellent&#10;tool to study the different patterns of energy loss for quarks and&#10;gluons .&#10;&#10;The paper is organized as follows. In Section \[sec:theory\] we discuss&#10;jet charge at p+p collisions and then show the theoretical framework of&#10;computing jet charge in A+A reactions including jet quenching effect. In&#10;Section \[sec:results\] the preliminary results of medium modification&#10;of jet charge are provided with discussions. At last, we give a brief&#10;summary in Section \[sec:summary\].">

<outline text="Theoretical framework" _note="The momentum-weighted electric charge sum of hadrons in the jet, called&#10;the averaged jet charge, is defined as: where indicates the jet flavour,&#10;and is the momentum fraction of the jet carried by the fragmentated&#10;hadron with electric charge . is a power parameter which varies from 0.1&#10;and 1 to adjust the bias of hadrons with different transverse momentum.&#10;&#10;Firstly we study jet charge in p+p collisions. It has been shown that&#10;the energy and and jet-size dependence of moments of jet-charge&#10;distributions can be calculated in perturbative QCD in . here, we employ&#10;the MC event generater pythia6 with the Perugia 2012 tune  to simulate&#10;particle production in p+p collisions, and the FastJet package  is used&#10;to construct final state jets. Shown in in Fig. \[fig:ATLAS\] are the&#10;results for jet charge in p+p collisons at  TeV from [pythia6+fastjet]{}&#10;compared with ATLAS recent data . One can observe that jet charge goes&#10;up with increasing jet transverse momentum, and the distributions with&#10;larger are higher . Decent agreement can be seen between experimental&#10;data and the theoretical calculation. In the following we use the same&#10;approach to predict jet charge at  TeV p+p collisions, which may provide&#10;a reasonable baseline for calculating jet charge in heavy-ion&#10;collisions.&#10;&#10;Moreover, we calculate the jet charge for quark and gluon jets&#10;respectively in Fig. \[fig:qg\]. It is shown that the features of jet&#10;charge for quark and gluon jets are quite different. Because gluon&#10;carries no electric charge, jet charge of a gluon jet is approaching&#10;zero in a whole range of . The averaged full jet charge is the&#10;combination of charges of quark and gluon jets after taking into account&#10;their relative contributions.&#10;&#10;Theoretical studies and experimental measurements have shown that fast&#10;partons traversing the QGP medium should suffer multiple scattering with&#10;other partons and lose energy due to collisional and radiative&#10;processes. In our calculation we will use PYQUEN(PYthia QUENched) model &#10;to simulate parton energy loss in the QGP medium. PYQUEN is one of the&#10;Monte Carlo models of jet quenching and built as a modification of jet&#10;events obtained for hadronic collisions with pythia6.4. The details of&#10;the used physics model and simulation procedure can be found in . The&#10;model has include both radiative and collisional energy loss of hard&#10;partons, as well as the realistic nuclear geometry. The collisional&#10;energy loss is considered by the formula:&#10;&#10;The radiative energy loss is simulated in the frameworks of BDMPS&#10;model , which gives :&#10;&#10;To investigate jet observables, another important ingredient of the&#10;model is the angular spectrum of medium-induced radiation. It has been&#10;found that to reproduce experimental data on jet observables such as&#10;inclusive jet cross sections, jet shape and jet fragmentation function&#10;in heavy-ion collisions, the “wide-angle” radiation scenario should be&#10;used in PYQUEN model , which is also adopted in the calculations of this&#10;work.&#10;&#10;It is noted that in the original version of PYQUEN model, the evolution&#10;of the QGP is described by a longitudinal expansion 1+1D Bjorken model&#10;with initial condition  fm and  GeV at central Pb+Pb collisions. In&#10;order to have a more realistic evolution of the fireball produced in&#10;relativstic heavy-ion reactions, in a modified version of PYQUEN we have&#10;instead used an event-by-event 3+1D ideal hydrodynamical model with an&#10;initial condition  fm and  GeV, which has given a nice descrption on the&#10;bulk properties in Pb+Pb collsions at the LHC .">

<outline text="Numerical results and discussions" _note="With the framework discussed in the last section, we calculate the&#10;average jet charge distribution for the leading jet in dijet events as&#10;function of the jet transverse momentum at the LHC energy. The candidate&#10;particles used to reconstruct jets are required to have  MeV. Jets are&#10;clustered by the anti- jet algorithm  with radius implemented in&#10;FastJet. We also make constraints of jet rapidity with , the two leading&#10;jets with . Here and are the transverse energy of the jets with the&#10;highest and second-highest , respectively.&#10;&#10;Shown in Fig. \[fig:2.76\] are our theoretical predictions for jet&#10;charges with in Pb+Pb collisions with  TeV at the LHC, the corresponding&#10;p+p baselines, as well as their ratios . It could be seen that the jet&#10;quenching effect will increase the averaged jet charge in heavy-ion&#10;collisions and this enhancement is more pronounced with smaller .&#10;&#10;This medium enhancement of jet charge in heavy-ion collisions results&#10;mainly from the suppressed gluon fraction due to jet quenching. From&#10;Fig. \[fig:qg\] we know that gluon jet contribution to the charge&#10;distribution of an indiscriminative full jet is negligible. In heavy-ion&#10;collisions, the gluon jet will lose more energy as compared to quark jet&#10;and its relative fraction in a full jet will be reduced in nuclear&#10;collisions. Therefore, in heavy-ion collisions the possibility of&#10;obtaining a quark-originated jet is enhanced with respect to p+p, which&#10;leads to larger jet charge because jet charge of quark is always much&#10;larger than gluon jet. Fig. \[fig:qg\] illustrates the nuclear&#10;modifications of jet charges for both quark jet and an indiscriminative&#10;jet, and one observes that the medium modification of quark jet charge&#10;is rather small.&#10;&#10;In conventional theoretical models of jet quenching, gluon is excepted&#10;to lose more energy than quark because of its large color factor with .&#10;However, the puzzle of proton over pion ratios in Au+Au collisions at&#10;RHIC seems challenge this relation  and our understanding of flavour&#10;dependence of parton energy loss( gluons, light quarks and massive&#10;quarks) is far from satisfactory. To investigate the sensitivity of jet&#10;charge to the different energy loss patterns of quarks and gluons we&#10;consider two simple scenarios of energy loss patterns (Scenario I with&#10;and Scenario II with ) and then calculate the corresponding jet charges.&#10;&#10;We show the numerical results in Fig. \[fig:f1\] and , and find that&#10;Scenario I with will give larger averaged jet charge than that in&#10;Scenario II with . This difference results from the enhancement of&#10;relative fraction of quark jets in Scenario I as shown in&#10;Fig. \[fig:quark-ratio\], and the larger fraction of quark jets will&#10;increase jet charge because the charge of gluon-originated jet is&#10;negligible. So a comparison of the sophisticated theory and precise&#10;measurement of jet charge in heavy-ion collisions should help unravel&#10;the flavour patterns of parton energy loss.">

<outline text="Summary" _note="We calculate numerically the momentum-weighted sum of jet charges in&#10;relativistic heavy-ion collisions for the first time. It is shown that&#10;the jet charge is significant modified by the jet quenching effect in&#10;the QGP medium. Quark jet charge has shown a quite distinct feature with&#10;gluon jet charge, and the sensitivity of jet charge to flavour&#10;dependence of parton energy loss is also investigated. It could be seen&#10;that jet change is an excellent observable to discriminate quark and&#10;gluon jets and their energy loss patterns in heavy-ion collisions.&#10;&#10;We thank Prof. X. N. Wang, Wei Chen and G. Y. Ma for helpful&#10;discussions.
