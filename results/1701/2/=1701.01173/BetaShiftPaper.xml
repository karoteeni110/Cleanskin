    <title>Follower, Predecessor, and Extender Set Sequences of -Shifts</title>
    <abstract>Given a one-dimensional shift , let be the number of follower sets of
words of length in , and be the number of predecessor sets of words of
length in . We call the sequence the follower set sequence of the shift
, and the predecessor set sequence of the shift . Extender sets are a
generalization of follower sets (see  ), and we define the extender set
sequence similarly. In this paper, we examine achievable differences in
limiting behavior of follower, predecessor, and extender set sequences.
This is done through the classical -shifts, first introduced in . We
show that the follower set sequences of -shifts must grow at most
linearly in , while the predecessor and extender set sequences may
demonstrate exponential growth rate in , depending on choice of . </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="For any or shift and finite word appearing in some point of , the&#10;**follower set** of , written , is defined as the set of all words such&#10;that the word occurs in some point of . The **predecessor set** of ,&#10;written , is the set of all words such that the word occurs in some&#10;point of . The **extender set** of , written , is the set of all pairs&#10;of words such that the word occurs in some point of . It is well-known&#10;that for a shift , finiteness of is equivalent to being sofic, that is,&#10;the image of a shift of finite type under a continuous shift-commuting&#10;map. (see  ) (In fact it is true that finiteness of is equivalent to&#10;being sofic as well, see  ).&#10;&#10;We define the set to be for any positive integer . Thus is the total&#10;number of distinct follower sets which correspond to some word of length&#10;in . and are defined similarly for predecessor and extender sets. Since&#10;the alphabet is finite, there are only finitely many words of a given&#10;length , and so for any shift (sofic or not), and are finite for every .&#10;If is sofic, is finite, and thus the follower set sequence must be&#10;bounded, and similarly for the predecessor set sequence and extender set&#10;sequence .&#10;&#10;In , the author showed that these sequences can exhibit surprising&#10;behavior. In the sofic case, these sequences may be eventually periodic&#10;rather than eventually constant, and the period, as well as the gaps&#10;between values, can be arbitrarily prescribed. The author also showed&#10;the existence of a non-sofic shift whose follower and extender set&#10;sequences were not monotone increasing.&#10;&#10;In all of these examples, the follower, predecessor, and extender set&#10;sequences behaved similarly, oscillating with the same periods, or in&#10;the non-sofic case, exhibiting the same growth rates. In this paper we&#10;establish that this is not always the case, demonstrating examples in&#10;which the follower set sequence displays different limiting behavior&#10;than the predecessor and extender set sequences. We do this by use of&#10;the classical -shifts, introduced in  . We show that the follower set&#10;sequence must grow linearly, while the predecessor and extender set&#10;sequence may grow exponentially.&#10;&#10;We also show a wide class of complexity sequences which may be realized&#10;as predecessor set sequences of shift spaces. To do this, we prove that&#10;for any right-infinite sequence with complexity sequence , the sequence&#10;may be realized as the predecessor set sequence of a -shift for some .">

<outline text="Definitions and preliminaries" _note="Let denote a finite set, which we will refer to as our alphabet.&#10;&#10;A **word** over is a member of for some . We denote the length of a word&#10;by .&#10;&#10;For any words and , we define the **concatenation** to be the pattern in&#10;whose first letters are the letters forming and whose next letters are&#10;the letters forming .&#10;&#10;A word is a **prefix** of a right-infinite sequence if the first -many&#10;letters of are the letters forming . We denote the n-letter prefix of a&#10;sequence by .&#10;&#10;The **language** of a shift , denoted by , is the set of all words which&#10;appear in points of . For any finite , , the set of words in the&#10;language of with length . The **complexity sequence** of a shift is for&#10;every . That is, the complexity sequence is the sequence which records&#10;the number of words of length appearing in some point of for every&#10;length .&#10;&#10;For any one-dimensional shift over the alphabet , and any word in the&#10;language of , we define the **follower set of in **, , to be the set of&#10;all finite words such that the word occurs in some point of . The&#10;**predecessor set of in **, , is defined to be the set of all finite&#10;words such that the word occurs in some point of . In some works, the&#10;follower and predecessor sets have been defined to be the set of all&#10;one-sided infinite sequences (in or for followers and predecessors,&#10;respectively) which may follow/precede . This definition is equivalent&#10;for followers, and in the case of a two-sided shift, for predecessors as&#10;well. For a one-sided shift, of course, no infinite sequence may precede&#10;a word . The results of this paper will apply for either definition in&#10;any case where either definition makes sense.&#10;&#10;For any one-dimensional shift over the alphabet , and any word in the&#10;language of , we define the **extender set of w in **, , to be the set&#10;of all pairs where and the word occurs in some point of . Again, a&#10;definition replacing finite words with infinite sequences is equivalent&#10;in the two-sided case.&#10;&#10;For any word , define a projection function by . Such a function sends&#10;the extender set of onto the follower set of . Any two words with the&#10;same extender set would have the property then that , that is, that and&#10;have the same follower set. Similarly, words which have the same&#10;extender set also have the same predecessor set.&#10;&#10;For any positive integer , define the set . Thus the cardinality is the&#10;number of distinct follower sets of words of length in . Similarly,&#10;define and , so that is the number of distinct predecessor sets of words&#10;of length in and is the number of distinct extender sets of words of&#10;length in .&#10;&#10;Given a shift , the **follower set sequence of ** is the sequence . The&#10;**predecessor set sequence of ** is the sequence . The **extender set&#10;sequence of ** is the sequence .&#10;&#10;Let be a full shift on the alphabet . Then any word may be followed&#10;legally by any word in , and thus the follower set of any word is the&#10;same. Hence there is only one follower set in a full shift. Similarly,&#10;there is only one predecessor and one extender set in a full shift. Then&#10;.&#10;&#10;The even shift is the one-dimensional sofic shift with alphabet defined&#10;by forbidding odd runs of zeros between ones. It is a simple exercise to&#10;show that the even shift has three follower sets, and . The follower set&#10;sequence of the even shift is . It is easy to verify that for any word&#10;in the language of the even shift, the follower set of is identical to&#10;the follower set of one of these three words.&#10;&#10;A one-dimensional shift is a **shift of finite type** if there exists a&#10;finite collection of words such that a point is in if no word from ever&#10;appears in .&#10;&#10;A one-dimensional shift is **sofic** if it is the image of a shift of&#10;finite type under a continuous shift-commuting map.&#10;&#10;Equivalently, a shift is sofic iff there exists a finite directed graph&#10;with labeled edges such that the points of are exactly the sets of&#10;labels of infinite (or in the two-sided case, bi-infinite) walks on .&#10;Then is a **presentation** of and we say (or that is the **edge shift**&#10;presented by ). Another well-known equivalence is that sofic shifts are&#10;those with only finitely many follower sets, that is, a shift is sofic&#10;iff is finite. The same equivalence exists for extender sets: X is sofic&#10;iff is finite. (see  ) This necessarily implies that for a sofic shift ,&#10;the follower set sequence and extender set sequence of are bounded. In&#10;fact, the converse is also true: if the follower set or extender set&#10;sequence of a shift is bounded, then is necessarily sofic. (See  )&#10;&#10;A word is **synchronizing** if for any words and such that and are both&#10;in the language of , the word is also in the language of . For a sofic&#10;shift, there exists a presentation of such that every path labeled&#10;terminates at the same vertex.&#10;&#10;Suppose there is an order on the alphabet . Given two distinct words of&#10;the same length and , we say that is **lexicographically less than**&#10;(denoted ) if there exists such that for all , , but . That is, at the&#10;first place where and disagree, takes a lesser value than . We may also&#10;compare two right-infinite sequences using the lexicographic order.&#10;&#10;Two-sided shifts may be constructed from one-sided shifts using **the&#10;natural extension**: Given a one-sided shift , create a two-sided shift&#10;by asserting that a bi-infinite sequence is in if and only if every&#10;finite subword of is in .">

<outline text="Follower, Predecessor, and Extender Set Sequences of -shifts" _note="Given , consider the map given by . Let be the map which sends each&#10;point to its expansion in base . That is, if , then . (In the case where&#10;has more than one expansion, we take the lexicographically largest&#10;expansion.) The closure of the image, , is a one-sided symbolic&#10;dynamical system called the -shift. (Introduced in ). It is easily&#10;established that the -shift is measure-theoretically conjugate to the&#10;map : If we partition into the intervals for , along with , labeling&#10;each interval with its corresponding , then for a given , will be the&#10;label of the partition element in which resides. An equivalent&#10;characterization of the -shift is given by a right-infinite sequence .&#10;For any sequence on the alphabet , if and only if every shift of is&#10;lexicographically less than or equal to (see  ). Then clearly, the&#10;sequence has the property that every shift of is lexicographically less&#10;than or equal to . The sequence only terminates with an infinite string&#10;of 0’s in the case that is a shift of finite type, however, the sequence&#10;never terminates with an infinite string of 0’s. Indeed, if and only if&#10;is a shift of finite type (see  ).&#10;&#10;\[GMS\] The golden mean shift , the shift on alphabet in which the word&#10;11 may not appear, considered as a one-sided shift, is the -shift&#10;corresponding to . Since the golden mean shift is a shift of finite&#10;type, we should have that terminates in an infinite string of 0’s, and .&#10;Indeed, , and The reader may check that the requirement that every shift&#10;of a right infinite sequence be lexicographically less than or equal to&#10;is equivalent to the requirement that the right-infinite sequence never&#10;see the word 11.&#10;&#10;In fact, any right-infinite sequence satisfying the two properties we&#10;have discussed must be equal to for some :&#10;&#10;\[twoprops\] Let be a one-sided right-infinite sequence on the alphabet&#10;(with occurring in ) such that every shift of is lexicographically less&#10;than or equal to and does not end with an infinite string of zeros. Then&#10;there exists such that .&#10;&#10;Suppose be a sequence on the alphabet with the symbol occuring in . Let&#10;. Because not all are equal to zero, the equation has some solution by&#10;the Intermediate Value Theorem. Because does not end in an infinite&#10;string of 0’s, it cannot be the case that is an expansion which is equal&#10;to as in the case where is a shift of finite type. Furthermore, the&#10;requirement that every shift of is lexicographically less than or equal&#10;to necessitates that , for if but for some , then , a contradiction.&#10;Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by , we get with the final&#10;inequality being strict because not all of may be equal to 0. On the&#10;other hand, as . But then&#10;&#10;Moreover, is sofic if and only if is eventually periodic (see ). We use&#10;these facts to characterize the follower set sequences of all one-sided&#10;-shifts:&#10;&#10;\[safewords\] If and does not terminate with any prefix of the sequence&#10;, then . Thus, .&#10;&#10;If , then trivially. Then we claim as well. Given , if , as is legal. If&#10;, then the first letters of are not a prefix of , but since they are&#10;contained in the legal word , must be lexicographically less than the&#10;first letters of , and thus, . Thus, and .&#10;&#10;\[FSConj\] For any -shift, for any if and only if is sofic.&#10;&#10;Since , we have . Clearly for very small must begin with , and so must&#10;begin with , which is lexicographically larger than , and so by Lemma&#10;\[safewords\], for any -shift. It was shown in that having a word with&#10;implies the conjecture of Ormes and Pavlov: for some if and only if is&#10;sofic. Thus, this conjecture holds for every -shift.&#10;&#10;\[UBFSSbeta\] For any -shift, and for any , we have .&#10;&#10;Fix and partition the words into classes based on the maximal prefix of&#10;appearing as a suffix of the word . So the class will contain words&#10;which do not contain any prefix of as a suffix, while the words in the&#10;class are words ending with the first letter of , but containing no&#10;larger prefix of as a suffix, and so on, up to , which consists of the&#10;single word formed by the first letters of . We claim that for two words&#10;and such that and are in the same class, . This will imply the result.&#10;&#10;By Lemma \[safewords\], any word will have , and so the claim is&#10;certainly true for . contains only one word, so the claim holds&#10;trivially for as well. So let and consider two words . Then the last&#10;letters of and are identical, and equal to the first letters of , and so&#10;and may only differ on their first letters. Let be some word in , so&#10;there exists some right-infinite sequence such that is a point of . Then&#10;every shift of is lexicographically less than or equal to . Then,&#10;certainly, every shift of beyond the first shifts is lexicographically&#10;less than or equal to , because after the first letters, and are equal.&#10;Furthermore, for , is not a prefix of by definition of the class , and&#10;so is already strictly lexicographically less than the first letters of&#10;because is a legal word. Then, any sequence may follow and will be less&#10;lexicographically than . So in fact, the first letters place no&#10;restrictions whatsoever on the words which may follow , and indeed, . So&#10;and similarly, , so . Hence, for any -shift , for all .&#10;&#10;\[FSSNonsoficBeta\] For any nonsofic -shift , .&#10;&#10;By Thm. \[UBFSSbeta\], for all . If is non-sofic, by Lemma \[FSConj\],&#10;for all . Thus, for all we have , that is, the follower set sequence of&#10;is equal to .&#10;&#10;The shift contains a synchronizing word if and only if there exists some&#10;word such that is not a subword of the sequence (see ). This provides&#10;examples of non-sofic shifts which contain a synchronizing word and&#10;still have the property that for all . Non-sofic -shifts are furthermore&#10;remarkable because, unlike Sturmian shifts and other examples in which&#10;for all , non-sofic -shifts have positive topological entropy. ( and the&#10;topological entropy of a -shift is ).&#10;&#10;Though this is sufficient to characterize the follower set sequences of&#10;non-sofic beta-shifts, we may also prove that non-sofic beta-shifts have&#10;follower sets of words of length for every using the following lemma,&#10;which will be useful later:&#10;&#10;\[prefixes\] Let be a -shift. Let such that contains multiple different&#10;prefixes of as suffixes (all necessarily nested subwords). Say the&#10;longest prefix of contained as a suffix of has length . Then for every&#10;such that has a prefix of of length as a suffix, and therefore the&#10;follower set of consists of exactly all finite prefixes of the sequences&#10;which are lexicographically less than or equal to .&#10;&#10;Suppose and contains a prefix of of length and a prefix of of length as&#10;suffixes. We will denote the prefix of length by , and similarly for .&#10;Note that the first and the last letters of must be equal to . So might&#10;look like:&#10;&#10;(It is also possible that no letters exist in the middle portion between&#10;the two occurences of , or even that they overlap; the proof still holds&#10;in such cases). If , then it is easy to see that , a contradiction, as&#10;every shift of must be lexicographically less than or equal to .&#10;Therefore , establishing the result. Since the right-infinite sequences&#10;which may legally follow consist of the sequences st. every shift of is&#10;lexicographically less than or equal to , we have Since is the smallest&#10;such shift, the follower set of consists exactly of prefixes of those&#10;sequences lexicographically less than or equal to .&#10;&#10;\[betacorrollary\] Let be a -shift, , and the classes be as defined in&#10;the proof of Theorem \[UBFSSbeta\]. Then the follower set of words in&#10;class is equal to the follower set of words in class if and only if .&#10;&#10;Lemma \[prefixes\] shows that we may distinguish between follower sets&#10;of words by only looking at , where is the length of the longest prefix&#10;of appearing as a suffix of the word. The corollary follows immediately&#10;from that observation.&#10;&#10;It is easy to characterize the follower sets of a non-sofic -shift from&#10;this corollary: since is not eventually periodic, implies , and&#10;therefore the follower sets in each class must all be distinct. Thus,&#10;for each , (confirming a result we already established in Corollary&#10;\[FSSNonsoficBeta\]). On the other hand, the corollary will also aid in&#10;characterizing the follower set sequences of sofic -shifts:&#10;&#10;\[sofic beta\] For any sofic -shift, let . Then for any , we have:&#10;&#10;If is sofic sequence is eventually periodic (see  ). Let . Then for&#10;every length , the shifts , , are all distinct, and so by Cor.&#10;\[betacorrollary\]. However, at length , the word in will have the same&#10;follower set as words in length for some by Cor. \[betacorrollary\], and&#10;so there will only be (rather than ) follower sets of words of length .&#10;But if , then for all , and so after length , no lengths will contribute&#10;any new follower sets. Indeed, for all .&#10;&#10;We next explore the predecessor set sequences of -shifts.&#10;&#10;\[PSSBeta\] For any -shift , the predecessor set sequence of is equal to&#10;the complexity sequence of .&#10;&#10;First, partition all finite words into classes as before, indexed by the&#10;maximal prefix of appearing as a suffix of the word. So is the set of&#10;words containing no prefix of as a suffix, is the set of words&#10;terminating with the first letter of but containing no larger prefix as&#10;a suffix, and so on. Note that, as we are considering all finite words,&#10;not just finite words of a fixed length, there will be infinitely many&#10;classes, each containing words of many different lengths.&#10;&#10;Let and . Then all of the words in are in the predecessor set of if and&#10;only if (we are implicitly using Lemma \[prefixes\] to rule out the&#10;possibility that a prefix of of length less than could introduce some&#10;illegal word). For the rest of this proof, when a word satisfies the&#10;condition , we will simply say that w SATISFIES CONDITION . Since may&#10;range from to infinity, while is fixed, every -letter word in will&#10;appear as the upper bound in condition for some . Moreover, these&#10;predecessor sets are nested–if is part of the predecessor set of a word&#10;, then it is also part of the predecessor set of every lexicographically&#10;smaller word of the same length. So, given a word , the predecessor set&#10;of depends only on how many of different conditions on are met. But&#10;since these conditions are nested, there are only (nested) subsets of&#10;these conditions which may be simultaneously met. Moreover, must satisfy&#10;at least ONE of them, because for any legal word , , so satisfies&#10;condition 0. If this is the only one of the conditions satisfied, then&#10;the predecessor set of only consists of words in and for any such that&#10;(that is, that condition and condition 0 are the same condition). If&#10;satisfies this condition and only one other, the predecessor set of&#10;contains and any such as before, along with any such that is equal to&#10;the lexicographically greatest -letter word in besides , and so on. In&#10;other words, words in are part of the predecessor set of when satisfies&#10;condition , but there are only -many subsets of which are realizable as&#10;the set of all for which satisfies condition . Thus, for all , there are&#10;predecessor sets of length in . So the predecessor set sequence of any&#10;-shift is .&#10;&#10;This is enough to see that the predecessor and follower set sequences of&#10;-shifts may exhibit vastly different limiting behavior:&#10;&#10;Let be any right-infinite sequence on which contains every word in as a&#10;subword, that is, that is dense in . Let , so the first digit of is 2&#10;and . Then satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma \[twoprops\] and so there&#10;exists some such that . Since is certainly not eventually periodic, is&#10;non-sofic, and so the follower set sequence of is by Corollary&#10;\[FSSNonsoficBeta\]. On the other hand, by Theorem \[PSSBeta\], the&#10;predecessor set sequence of is . This shows that the predecessor set&#10;sequence may grow exponentially in even when the follower set sequence&#10;grows only linearly in .&#10;&#10;We see that the complexity sequence of any sequence which serves as for&#10;some may be realized as the predecessor set sequence of a shift space.&#10;This leads us to a new question: May any complexity sequence appear as&#10;the follower or predecessor set sequence of some shift? The following&#10;propositions answer the question in the affirmative for a wide class of&#10;sequences:&#10;&#10;\[achievable\] Let be the complexity sequence of a right-infinite&#10;sequence such that for all , . Then the sequence is the predecessor set&#10;sequence of for some .&#10;&#10;If is such that for all , , and does not end in an infinite string of&#10;0’s, then by Lemma \[twoprops\] there exists such that , and by Theorem&#10;\[PSSBeta\], . If is such that for all , , but does end in an infinite&#10;string of 0’s, define a new sequence such that each digit of is one&#10;greater than the corresponding digit of . Then has the same complexity&#10;sequence as , and also satisfies the property that for all , , and so by&#10;Lemma \[twoprops\] there exists such that , and by Theorem \[PSSBeta\],&#10;.&#10;&#10;\[PlusOne\] Let be the complexity sequence of any right-infinite&#10;sequence . Then the sequence is the predecessor set sequence of for some&#10;.&#10;&#10;Suppose does not satisfy the property that for all , . (We may assume&#10;that we have already added 1 to each digit, if necessary, so that does&#10;not end in a string of 0’s). Then create a new sequence so that , but&#10;the first letter of is lexicographically greater than any symbol in .&#10;Then satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma \[twoprops\] and so there exists&#10;such that , and by Theorem \[PSSBeta\], . For each length , will have&#10;one more n-letter word than the number occuring in . Specifically, the&#10;first letters of cannot occur in because the first symbol of is not in&#10;the alphabet of . Moreover, any word occuring in which does not see the&#10;first letter of is necessarily a subword of , as . Therefore, for any ,&#10;.&#10;&#10;Finally, we explore the extender set sequences of non-sofic -shifts.&#10;&#10;\[wordsind\] Let be non-sofic. Then for any distinct words with –that&#10;is, is a word actually appearing in the sequence – and have distinct&#10;extender sets.&#10;&#10;If both words and appear in , and will have different predecessor&#10;sets–there will exist some n-letter word in which one of the words is&#10;lexicographically less than or equal to but the other is not, namely,&#10;whichever of and is lexicographically lesser. Thus in this case, and&#10;have different extender sets. On the other hand, suppose and . If and&#10;have different follower or predecessor sets, they trivially have&#10;different extender sets, so suppose and . (This implies that and end&#10;with the same maximal prefix of , and, by the above argument, that .&#10;Note that obviously any digits on which and differ must occur before&#10;their shared suffix). Let be the shortest finite word such that is a&#10;prefix of . Choose a word which is lexicographically strictly larger&#10;than . Such a must exist: If there does not exist a legal word which is&#10;lexicographically strictly larger than , then either is the first&#10;letters of , in which case the requirement that and end in the same&#10;maximal prefix of forces , or else is the lexicographically largest&#10;legal -letter word in , meaning that . But since this must be true for&#10;every possible value of , we have that , and so is sofic. After choosing&#10;such a , it is clear that is not in the extender set of . However, is in&#10;the extender set of : is a synchronizing word, and since and , and are&#10;legal, so is legal.&#10;&#10;Note that, in the sofic case, if only one of and is in , and MAY still&#10;have the same extender set:&#10;&#10;\[GMS2\] Recall that for the Golden Mean shift of Example \[GMS\], the&#10;one-sided shift is realizable as a -shift for . In such a case, we have&#10;, a periodic sequence. It is clear that for a sequence on , having is&#10;equivalent to having no two adjacent 1’s. Moreover, the word clearly has&#10;the same extender set as the word , despite appearing in , showing that&#10;the result of Lemma \[wordsind\] does not hold in the sofic case.&#10;&#10;\[nonsoficformula\] Let be a non-sofic -shift. For , let the classes ,&#10;be as defined in the proof of Theorem \[UBFSSbeta\]. Let be defined by&#10;Then for any , .&#10;&#10;Let be a non-sofic -shift and . By Lemma \[wordsind\], for any word in ,&#10;and any word implies . Thus has distinct extender sets corresponding to&#10;words in , and moreover, any words not in will have extender sets&#10;distinct from those of words in . Also, for any -shift (sofic or not),&#10;if and both fail to be in , then and are both synchronizing, and so and&#10;is sufficient to prove . Thus, the number of additional extender sets in&#10;corresponding to words not in is the number of pairings of predecessor&#10;and follower sets achievable by those words. By Thm.  \[PSSBeta\], each&#10;predecessor set is represented by some . By Thm.  \[UBFSSbeta\], the&#10;follower set of a word is determined by the class , in which it lives.&#10;Hence the total number of possible pairings of predecessor and follower&#10;sets achievable by words not in may be expressed by .&#10;&#10;\[soficincl\] The formula given in Theorem \[nonsoficformula\] is an&#10;upper bound on the extender set sequence for sofic -shifts. The only&#10;difference between the two is that in the sofic case, some of the&#10;extender sets of words in may be the same as extender sets of words not&#10;in , so the formula may have overcounted.&#10;&#10;Though the formula in Theorem \[nonsoficformula\] is exact, the&#10;following bounds on the extender set sequence of a non-sofic -shift are&#10;simpler to express:&#10;&#10;\[ESBounds\] For any non-sofic -shift , , .&#10;&#10;Clearly for any , , proving the first inequality. For the second&#10;inequality, we use the equation from Corollary  \[nonsoficformula\]:&#10;Recall that the class contains only one word, . Therefore, for any , .&#10;Hence,&#10;&#10;The above Corollary shows that for a non-sofic -shift , for any .&#10;&#10;Two-sided -shifts may be constructed from one-sided -shifts using the&#10;natural extension; while the arguments of this paper are made&#10;specifically for one-sided shifts , the reader may check that the&#10;following proposition provides the tools to generalize any of those&#10;results to two-sided -shifts as well:&#10;&#10;\[two-sided\] For any , let be the one-sided -shift and be the two-sided&#10;-shift corresponding to . Then .&#10;&#10;By definition of the natural extension, . Let . Then there exists a&#10;one-sided sequence such that and is a subword of . But then for any , as&#10;well. (If every shift of is lexicographically less than or equal to ,&#10;then surely the same is true of ). By taking limits of such sequences,&#10;we see that the sequence is an element of , and so , completing the&#10;proof.">
