<outline text="Finiteness properties and first Betti numbers" _note="We will now show how the results of Section \[secSESCoab\] can be used&#10;to prove that under the assumption of strong enough finiteness&#10;properties the projections in Theorem \[thmNewCoab\] have a finite index&#10;subgroup with even first Betti number.&#10;&#10;\[propVB1\] Let and let be a homomorphism that is induced by a&#10;holomorphic map with full image of type for . Then is virtually&#10;coabelian of even rank and there is a finite index subgroup with even&#10;first Betti number.&#10;&#10;It follows from Proposition \[propNewCoab\] that is virtually coabelian&#10;of even rank. Let be finite index subgroups, and be an epimorphism such&#10;that is a finite index subgroup.&#10;&#10;By Lemma \[lemSurjComp\], the group is a finite index subgroup for all .&#10;Since , there is a partition of into three disjoint subsets , and such&#10;that . Thus, is a finite index subgroup.&#10;&#10;Define . Consider the finite index subgroup and define finite index&#10;subgrups . Consider the restriction of to the finite index subgroup .&#10;&#10;Since , we have . Thus, the projection of onto the is surjective and we&#10;can therefore apply Proposition \[thmBettiZ\]. Hence, the induced&#10;homomorphism is injective and However, is even, because is a finite&#10;index subgroup of the Kähler group for . Thus, we obtain for the finite&#10;index subgroup .&#10;&#10;With the notation of Theorem \[thmNewCoab\], assume that the group has&#10;finiteness type . Then the projections onto factors with indices have a&#10;finite index subgroup with even first Betti number.&#10;&#10;If, moreover, and , then is even.&#10;&#10;The first part is an immediate consequence of Proposition \[propVB1\]&#10;and the fact that the homomorphism in Theorem \[thmNewCoab\] is&#10;virtually induced by a holomorphic map.&#10;&#10;For the second part, observe that after possibly passing to the finite&#10;index subgroup , we may assume that is a direct product with full&#10;subdirect. Since , has a finite index subgroup with even first Betti&#10;number. The group is Kähler, so it also has even first Betti number.&#10;Therefore, is even.">
