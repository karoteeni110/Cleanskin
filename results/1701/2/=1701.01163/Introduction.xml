<outline text="Introduction" _note="A KÄHLER GROUP is a group that can be realised as the fundamental group&#10;of a closed Kähler manifold. The question of which finitely presented&#10;groups are Kähler was first raised by Serre in the 1950s and has driven&#10;a field of very active research since. While numerous strong constraints&#10;have been proved and examples of Kähler groups with a variety of&#10;different properties have been constructed, the question remains wide&#10;open. For a general background on Kähler groups see , for a more recent&#10;overview see .&#10;&#10;While a general answer seems out of reach for the moment, it is fruitful&#10;to consider Serre’s question in the context of more specific classes of&#10;groups. For instance, it has been shown that if the fundamental group of&#10;a compact 3-manifold without boundary is Kähler then it is finite (see&#10;also and ) and that a Kähler group with non-trivial first L2-Betti&#10;number is commensurable to a SURFACE GROUP (i.e. the fundamental group&#10;of a closed Riemann surface) . Delzant and Py showed that if a Kähler&#10;group acts geometrically on a locally finite CAT(0) cube complex, then&#10;it is commensurable to a direct product of finitely many surface groups&#10;and a free abelian group .&#10;&#10;More generally, a close connection between Kähler groups acting on&#10;CAT(0) cube complexes and subgroups of direct products of surface groups&#10;has been observed starting with the work of Delzant and Gromov on cuts&#10;in Kähler groups (see also ). This led Delzant and Gromov to pose the&#10;question of which Kähler groups are subgroups of direct products of&#10;surface groups? Following the work of Bridson, Howie, Miller and Short ,&#10;one knows that this question is intimately related to the question of&#10;finding Kähler groups which are not of FINITENESS TYPE for some , i.e.&#10;do not admit a classifying space with finite -skeleton: any subgroup of&#10;a direct product of surface groups which is is virtually a direct&#10;product of surface groups and finitely generated free groups.&#10;&#10;The first examples of Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface&#10;groups which are of type but not () were constructed by Dimca, Papadima&#10;and Suciu . Their class of examples has since been extended by Biswas,&#10;Mj and Pancholi and by the author . All of these examples arise as&#10;kernels of surjective homomorphisms of the form where and is a closed&#10;Riemann surface of genus , . Recently, examples of Kähler groups that&#10;are of type but not of type , and which are not commensurable to any&#10;subgroup of a direct product of surface groups have been constructed by&#10;Bridson and the author .&#10;&#10;This paper consists of three parts. In the first part (Section 2) we&#10;develop a new construction method for Kähler groups. The groups obtained&#10;from this method arise as fundamental groups of fibres of holomorphic&#10;maps onto higher-dimensional complex tori. In the second and third part&#10;we address Delzant and Gromov’s question. In the second part (Sections 3&#10;– 5) we apply our construction method to provide Kähler subgroups of&#10;direct products of surface groups that are not commensurable with any of&#10;the previous examples. These arise as kernels of a surjective&#10;homomorphism onto and are IRREDUCIBLE, i.e. do not decompose as direct&#10;product of two nontrivial groups (even virtually). The examples&#10;constructed in this work significantly extend the range of irreducible&#10;full subdirect Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups:&#10;all previous examples of such Kähler subgroups of a product of surface&#10;groups are either virtually a product of surface groups and a free&#10;abelian group, or of type , but not of type . Here we produce&#10;irreducible examples of type and not of type for all , hence covering&#10;the full range of possible finiteness properties . In the third part&#10;(Sections 6 – 9) we give new constraints of Kähler subgroups of direct&#10;products of surface groups. In particular, we show that if a full&#10;subdirect product of surface group is Kähler of type with then it is&#10;virtually the kernel of an epimorphism from the product of surface&#10;groups onto a free abelian group of even rank.&#10;&#10;One says that a surjective holomorphic map between compact complex&#10;manifolds has ISOLATED SINGULARITIES if the critical locus of intersects&#10;each fibre (preimage of a point) in a discrete subset. The key result in&#10;our construction method is Theorem \[thmFiltVerGen\], a special case of&#10;which is:&#10;&#10;Let be a compact complex manifold of dimension and let be a complex&#10;torus of dimension . Let be a surjective holomorphic map with connected&#10;smooth generic fibre . Assume that there is a filtration of by complex&#10;subtori of dimension such that the projections have isolated&#10;singularities, where is the holomorphic quotient homomorphism.&#10;&#10;If , then the map induces a short exact sequence Furthermore, we obtain&#10;that for . \[thmFiltVer\]&#10;&#10;Theorem \[thmFiltVer\] and Theorem \[thmFiltVerGen\] are generalisations&#10;of and . We expect that our methods can be applied to construct&#10;interesting new classes of Kähler groups. Indeed we provide a first&#10;application in this work, by constructing new classes of Kähler&#10;subgroups of direct products of surface groups.&#10;&#10;Throughout this article will denote a closed hyperbolic surface of genus&#10;and its fundamental group.&#10;&#10;Let and be integers and let be an elliptic curve (i.e. a complex torus&#10;of dimension one). For let be a branched cover of , with and assume that&#10;is surjective on fundamental groups for . Then there is a surjective&#10;holomorphic map with smooth generic fibre such that the restriction of&#10;to each factor factors through . The map induces a short exact sequence&#10;and the group is Kähler of type but not of type . Furthermore, is&#10;irreducible. \[thmIntroA\]&#10;&#10;Here we use the notation for the cartesian product of copies of . The&#10;coabelian subgroups of direct products of surface groups form an&#10;important subclass of the class of all subgroups of direct products of&#10;surface groups. Indeed, in the case of three factors any finitely&#10;presented full subdirect subgroup of is virtually COABELIAN, i.e.&#10;contains the derived subgroup of some of finite index; with more factors&#10;any full subdirect subgroup is virtually conilpotent . We will give a&#10;more detailed discussion of subgroups of direct products of surface&#10;groups in Section \[secNotProd\].&#10;&#10;We will see that the examples we construct to prove Theorem&#10;\[thmIntroA\] are in some sense the generic class of examples with the&#10;property that the image of each factor in is an elliptic curve. As a&#10;consequence of Theorem \[thmIntroA\] and its proof we obtain that there&#10;are indeed Kähler groups covering the full range of possible finiteness&#10;properties of irreducible full subdirect products of surface groups.&#10;&#10;For every , and , there is a Kähler subgroup which is an irreducible&#10;full subdirect product of type but not of type . \[corthmIntroA\]&#10;&#10;We will see that a modification of the construction used to prove&#10;Theorem \[thmIntroA\] provides a second class of examples (see Theorem&#10;\[thmExtendedRange\]). As a consequence we see that Theorem&#10;\[corthmIntroA\] can also be proved by considering only holomorphic maps&#10;to a product of two elliptic curves. The reduction in dimension of the&#10;complex torus will come at the cost of loosing the genericity of the&#10;examples in Theorem \[thmIntroA\].&#10;&#10;Conversely, we address the question of finding constraints on Kähler&#10;subgroups of direct products of surface groups, or more generally on&#10;Kähler groups that admit homomorphisms to direct products of surface&#10;groups.&#10;&#10;\[thmNewCoab\] Let with compact Kähler and let be a surjective&#10;homomorphisms onto a subgroup . Assume that has finitely generated&#10;kernel and that is full and of type for .&#10;&#10;Then, after reordering factors, there is such that, for any and any ,&#10;the projection is virtually coabelian of even rank. Furthermore, the&#10;center is a finite index subgroup.&#10;&#10;Combining Theorem \[thmNewCoab\] with a study of the first Betti number&#10;of coabelian subdirect products of groups in Section&#10;\[secFinPropBetti\], allows us to show that there are non-Kähler&#10;subgroups of direct products of surface groups with interesting&#10;properties.&#10;&#10;\[corNewCoabExs\] Let for an epimorphism. Then is not Kähler.&#10;&#10;For and there is a non-Kähler full subdirect product with even first&#10;Betti number. \[corExEvenB1Intro\]">
  <outline text="Structure:" _note="This work is structured as follows: In Section \[secMainThm\] we prove&#10;Theorem \[thmFiltVerGen\]. In Sections \[secExamples\] and&#10;\[secExCombined\] we construct large new classes of Kähler subgroups of&#10;direct products of surface groups, which we use to prove Thereoms&#10;\[thmIntroA\] and \[corthmIntroA\]. In Section \[secNotProd\] we show&#10;that these examples are irreducible, i.e. are not virtually direct&#10;products, and derive there precise finiteness properties. In Section&#10;\[secResCoabKGs\] we study homomorphisms from Kähler groups to direct&#10;products of surface groups and show Theorem \[thmNewCoab\] and Corollary&#10;\[corNewCoabExs\]. In Section \[secSESCoab\] we study the first Betti&#10;number of coabelian subgroups of direct products of groups and prove&#10;Corollary \[corExEvenB1Intro\]. We apply the results of Section&#10;\[secFinPropBetti\] to obtain additional constraints on homomorphisms&#10;from Kähler groups to direct products of surface groups. In Section&#10;\[secConsGens\] we consider the universal homomorphism from a Kähler&#10;group to a direct product of Riemann orbisurfaces and we explain why our&#10;constraints apply to it.&#10;&#10;I am very grateful to my PhD advisor Martin Bridson for his generous&#10;support and the many very helpful discussions we had about the contents&#10;of this paper, and to Simon Donaldson for inspiring conversations about&#10;topics related to the contents of this paper.&#10;&#10;This article is a fundamentally rewritten and extended version of&#10;arXiv:1701.01163v2. Some of the new material contained in this work is&#10;based on results from the authors PhD thesis.">
