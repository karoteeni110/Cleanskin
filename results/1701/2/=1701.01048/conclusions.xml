<outline text="Conclusions" _note="This chapter provides a review of SDP methods, that perform abstract&#10;reasoning for stochastic planning, from the viewpoint of probabilistic&#10;inference. We have illustrated how the planning problem and the&#10;inference problem are related. Specifically, finite horizon optimization&#10;in MDPs is related to an inference problem with alternating maximization&#10;and expectation blocks and is therefore more complex than marginal MAP&#10;queries that have been studied in the literature. This analogy is valid&#10;both at the propositional and relational levels and it suggests a new&#10;line of challenges for inference problems in discrete domains.We have&#10;also identified the opportunity for generalized lifted inference, where&#10;the algorithm and its solution are agnostic of the domain instance and&#10;its size and are efficient regardless of this size. We have shown that&#10;under some conditions SDP algorithms provide generalized lifted&#10;inference. In more complex models, especially ones with additive rewards&#10;and exogenous events, SDP algorithms are yet to mature into an effective&#10;and widely applicable inference scheme. On the other hand, the&#10;challenges faced in such problems are exactly the ones typically seen in&#10;standard lifted inference problems. Therefore, exploring generalized&#10;lifted inference more abstractly has the potential to lead to advances&#10;in both areas.">
