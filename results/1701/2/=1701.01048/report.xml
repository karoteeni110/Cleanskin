    <title>Stochastic Planning and Lifted Inference</title>
    <abstract>Lifted probabilistic inference (Poole, 2003) and symbolic dynamic
programming for lifted stochastic planning (Boutilier et al, 2001) were
introduced around the same time as algorithmic efforts to use
abstraction in stochastic systems. Over the years, these ideas evolved
into two distinct lines of research, each supported by a rich
literature. Lifted probabilistic inference focused on efficient
arithmetic operations on template-based graphical models under a finite
domain assumption while symbolic dynamic programming focused on
supporting sequential decision-making in rich quantified logical action
models and on open domain reasoning. Given their common motivation but
different focal points, both lines of research have yielded highly
complementary innovations. In this chapter, we aim to help close the gap
between these two research areas by providing an overview of lifted
stochastic planning from the perspective of probabilistic inference,
showing strong connections to other chapters in this book. This also
allows us to define [GENERALIZED LIFTED INFERENCE]{} as a paradigm that
unifies these areas and elucidates open problems for future research
that can benefit both lifted inference and stochastic planning. </abstract>
