<outline text="Introduction" _note="In 1975, M. M. Choban introduced a new topology on the set of all closed&#10;subsets of a topological space for obtaining a generalization of the&#10;famous Kolmogoroff Theorem on operations on sets. This new topology is&#10;similar to the upper Vietoris topology but is weaker than it. In 1998,&#10;G. Dimov and D. Vakarelov defined another new hypertopology, which&#10;turned out to be a generalized version of the Choban topology, and&#10;called it a [TYCHONOFF-TYPE HYPERTOPOLOGY]{} (it could be also called an&#10;[UPPER-VIETORIS-TYPE HYPERTOPOLOGY]{}); they used it for proving an&#10;isomorphism theorem for the category of all Tarski consequence systems.&#10;Later on, the Tychonoff-type hypertopology was studied in details in .&#10;Further, in , a new lower-Vietoris-type hypertopology was introduced and&#10;studied. In this talk we define a new Vietoris-type hypertopology. We&#10;study it and show that, in general, it is different from the Vietoris&#10;topology. Also, some of the results of E. Michael about the hyperspaces&#10;with Vietoris topology are extended to analogous results for the&#10;hyperspaces with Vietoris-type topology.
