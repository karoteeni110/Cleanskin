We consider the family of Diophantine inequalities where the&#10;unknowns take their values in the set of elements in such that and . It&#10;follows from the results in that the set of solutions is finite.&#10;However, the proof in relies on Schmidt’s subspace theorem, which is not&#10;effective.

Let satisfy&#10;Then&#10;&#10;On the one hand, using Lemma (§), we will prove in § that which will&#10;enable us to deduce Theorem from Theorem . On the other hand, thanks to&#10;), we have . In general, we expect to be as large as (which is therefore&#10;the maximum possible), in which case the conclusion of Theorem becomes&#10;with a positive effective constant depending only on . In §, we give a&#10;few examples where this last bound is valid.&#10;&#10;In Theorem , the hypothesis that is not a root of unity cannot be&#10;omitted. Here is an example with . Let be the cyclotomic polynomial of&#10;index and degree (Euler totient function). Let be a primitive –th root&#10;of unity. Set and . For with , the irreducible polynomial of is nothing&#10;else than . Hence, if the equation has a solution with , then for&#10;infinitely many the twisted Thue equation has also the solution , since&#10;. For instance, when , we have and the equation has the solutions , , ,&#10;. The main result of , which deals only with non totally real cubic&#10;equations, is a special case of Theorem ; the “constants” in depend on&#10;and , while here they depend only on . The main result of deals with&#10;Thue equations twisted by a set of units which is not supposed to be a&#10;group of rank , but it involves an assumption (namely that at least two&#10;of the conjugates of have a modulus as large as a positive power of )&#10;which we do not need here. Our Theorem also improves the main result of&#10;: we remove the assumption that the unit is totally real (besides, the&#10;result of is not explicit in terms of the heights and regulator). We&#10;also notice that the part of Theorem 1.1 of follows from our Theorem .&#10;The main result of does not assume that the twists are done by a group&#10;of units of rank , but it needs a strong assumption which does not occur&#10;here, namely that the field has at most one real embedding.&#10;&#10;We conclude this §\[S:introduction\] with some more definitions and&#10;properties.&#10;&#10;When is a polynomial in one variable of degree with coefficients in and&#10;leading coefficient , the (usual) height of is the maximum of the&#10;absolute values of the coefficients of , while the Mahler measure of is&#10;where are the roots of in .&#10;&#10;Let us recall[^1] that the logarithmic height of an algebraic number of&#10;degree is where is the Mahler measure of the irreducible polynomial of .&#10;We have (see , Annex to Chapter 3, [INEQUALITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT&#10;HEIGHTS OF A POLYNOMIAL,]{} pp. 113–114; see also ).
