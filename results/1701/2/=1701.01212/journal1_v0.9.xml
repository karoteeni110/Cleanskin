    <title> Downlink Coverage Analysis for a Finite 3D Wireless Network of Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles</title>
    <abstract>In this paper, we consider a finite network of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) serving a given region. Modeling this network as a uniform
binomial point process (BPP), we derive the downlink coverage
probability of a reference receiver located at an arbitrary position on
the ground assuming Nakagami- fading for all wireless links. The
reference receiver is assumed to connect to its closest transmitting
node as is usually the case in cellular systems. After deriving the
distribution of distances from the reference receiver to the serving and
interfering nodes, we derive an exact expression for downlink coverage
probability in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform of
interference power distribution. In the downlink of this system, it is
not unusual to encounter scenarios in which the line-of-sight (LOS)
component is significantly stronger than the reflected multipath
components. To emulate such scenarios, we also derive the coverage
probability in the absence of fading from the results of Nakagami-
fading by taking the limit . Using asymptotic expansion of incomplete
gamma function, we concretely show that this limit reduces to a
redundant condition. Consequently, we derive an accurate coverage
probability approximation for this case using dominant interferer-based
approach in which the effect of dominant interferer is exactly captured
and the residual interference from other interferers is carefully
approximated. We then derive the bounds of the approximate coverage
probability using Berry-Esseen theorem. Our analyses reveal several
useful trends in coverage probability as a function of height of the
transmitting nodes and the location of reference receiver on the ground. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="With significant advancements in the drone technology, like increased&#10;payload capacity, longer average flight time, better power management&#10;techniques, and the capability to harvest solar energy, unmanned aerial&#10;vehicles (UAVs) can serve a multitude of purposes such as surveillance,&#10;localization and communication, making them a flexible solution to&#10;augment and enhance the capabilities of the current cellular systems.&#10;They provide an especially attractive solution to provide connectivity&#10;in the wake of disasters and accidents, which may completely cripple the&#10;terrestrial networks due to damaged equipment and/or loss of power . In&#10;general, UAVs provide a realistic solution in scenarios where there is a&#10;temporary need for network resources. These could include first&#10;responder situations, such as the one discussed above, or even usual&#10;civilian scenarios, such as football games or concerts. In order to&#10;provide short-term connectivity in such scenarios, temporary deployment&#10;of UAVs may be faster and more cost-effective compared to the temporary&#10;installation of conventional base stations. They are also currently&#10;being investigated as a possible candidate for providing ubiquitous&#10;connectivity in remote areas that lack traditional cellular&#10;infrastructure. While there is no doubt about the deployment flexibility&#10;and general benefits of UAVs, their performance in terms of the coverage&#10;and capacity provided to the terrestrial users is not quite well&#10;understood. This is especially true for a realistic use case of finite&#10;UAV networks, where we have a given number of UAVs serving users in a&#10;given region (such as a city). In this paper, we use tools from&#10;stochastic geometry to derive downlink signal-to-interference ratio&#10;distribution for this setup, which immediately provides useful insights&#10;into the coverage performance of the resulting three-dimensional&#10;network. Several intermediate results derived in this paper are also of&#10;general interest for the analysis of finite wireless networks.">
  <outline text="Motivation and Related Work" _note="The improvements in payload capacity and prolonged flight times have&#10;enabled the commercial use of UAVs, especially for communication&#10;purposes. UAV networks differ significantly from conventional wireless&#10;networks in terms of the mobility, energy constraints, as well as the&#10;propagation conditions. This has stimulated interest in the design of&#10;application-oriented protocols for the effective utilization of aerial&#10;networks . For instance, a cluster-based protocol, which improves the&#10;resilience to frequent link failures resulting from the motion of UAVs,&#10;has been proposed in . The flexibility offered by the mobility of UAVs&#10;has motivated a lot of [ALGORITHMIC]{} research efforts towards finding&#10;efficient trajectories and deployment strategies aimed at optimizing&#10;different network resources . For instance, an algorithm to optimize&#10;transmit power and frequency spectrum for autonomous self-deployment was&#10;proposed in . An adaptive algorithm for adjusting the UAV heading was&#10;proposed in  to improve the uplink performance and minimize mutual&#10;interference. An approach to optimize the altitude of UAVs to maximize&#10;coverage on the ground was proposed in . The performance of UAVs acting&#10;as relays between terrestrial users and base stations was investigated&#10;in . The problem of efficient placement of UAVs with slightly different&#10;objectives was studied in .&#10;&#10;Another direction of research, which is somewhat complementary to the&#10;one discussed above, is to develop techniques for the realistic&#10;system-level analysis of UAV networks. As is the case in terrestrial&#10;networks, such as cellular networks, these techniques can then be used&#10;to compare the performance of different deployment strategies and to&#10;benchmark their performance against standard baselines. In the case of&#10;UAV networks, the system-level performance has mostly been studied&#10;through field tests and simulations . For instance, in  the outage time&#10;and average goodput were compared for different routing algorithms using&#10;real-world experiments. While field-tests or simulations can provide&#10;initial insights into the behavior of the network, these methods are&#10;usually not scalable when the number of simulation parameters is large.&#10;One way of reducing the dimensionality of such problems is to endow the&#10;locations of the nodes with a distribution, which additionally allows&#10;the use of powerful tools from stochastic geometry to derive easy-to-use&#10;expressions for key performance metrics. While stochastic geometry has&#10;already emerged as a preferred tool for the analysis of ad hoc and&#10;cellular networks , its potential has not yet been exploited for the&#10;analysis of UAV networks. One relevant prior art is , which studies the&#10;co-existence of a device-to-device (D2D) communication network with a&#10;single UAV. In this work, we will develop the first comprehensive model&#10;aimed at the downlink analysis of a finite multi-UAV network using tools&#10;from stochastic geometry.&#10;&#10;While infinite homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) has become a&#10;canonical model for the spatial locations of terrestrial base stations ,&#10;it is not quite suitable for UAV networks, especially when a given&#10;number (likely small) of UAVs is deployed to cover a given finite&#10;region. For such scenarios, a simple yet reasonable model for the&#10;spatial distribution of UAVs is the homogeneous binomial point process&#10;(BPP) . More sophisticated models incorporating inter-point interaction&#10;are usually far less tractable. While BPP has not yet been used for the&#10;analysis of UAVs, it has received significant attention for the analysis&#10;of terrestrial networks with a given number of nodes. Until recently,&#10;however, the analysis was focused on ad hoc networks, in which a given&#10;number of nodes were assumed to be distributed uniformly at random in a&#10;circular region with the reference receiver located at the center of the&#10;circle . The outage probability for this reference receiver is then&#10;derived assuming that it is served by a reference transmitter located at&#10;a fixed distance (not a part of the BPP). In order to model cellular&#10;systems meaningfully with this setup, two key generalizations are&#10;required: (i) reference receiver can lie anywhere in the region, and&#10;(ii) serving base station for the reference receiver will be chosen from&#10;the BPP itself. For the latter, it is reasonable to assume that the&#10;reference receiver is served by the closest base station from the BPP.&#10;The exact analysis of this finite cellular network setup was done very&#10;recently in . An approximate analysis of a related setup also appears&#10;in . Building on the distance distributions derived in , we will perform&#10;downlink analysis for an arbitrarily located user on the ground that is&#10;served by a finite network of UAVs. In addition to providing the first&#10;such system-level analysis of a finite UAV network, several intermediate&#10;results provide constructs that are more generally applicable to the&#10;analysis of finite wireless networks. With this brief discussion, we now&#10;provide a precise summary of our contributions.">

  <outline text="Contributions" _note="[[MODELING OF FINITE THREE-DIMENSIONAL NETWORK.]{}]{} We develop a&#10;general framework for the downlink coverage analysis of finite&#10;three-dimensional networks under a fairly general channel fading model.&#10;In particular, we consider a finite network of a given number of UAVs&#10;whose locations are modeled as a uniform BPP in a plane at a fixed&#10;altitude above the ground. The reference receiver is assumed to be&#10;located at some arbitrary position on the ground. As noted above, we&#10;assume that the reference receiver connects to its closest transmitting&#10;UAV node. We then derive the distribution of distances from the&#10;reference receiver to the serving and interfering nodes. As the&#10;air-to-ground channel models are still under active investigation, we&#10;assume Nakagami- fading, which allows us to control the severity of&#10;multi-path fading (to emulate variety of scenarios) while retaining&#10;analytical tractability. In some deployment scenarios, the LOS component&#10;may be significantly stronger than the reflected multipath components,&#10;which means it may be reasonable to study system performance in the&#10;absence of small-scale fading. Such scenarios, which will henceforth be&#10;referred to as “no-fading” environments, are also studied in detail.&#10;[[COVERAGE PROBABILITY.]{}]{} We derive an exact expression for coverage&#10;probability of the reference receiver located at some arbitrary position&#10;on the ground for Nakagami- fading channel in terms of the Laplace&#10;transform of interference power distribution. While this problem has&#10;been studied in  for terrestrial networks, the complexity and form of&#10;the final expression forbids any further analysis or simplifications. In&#10;this paper, we develop an approach that explores the possibility of&#10;deriving the results for no-fading case from the results of Nakagami-&#10;fading by applying the limit . We use well-established mathematical&#10;results, especially asymptotic expansion of incomplete gamma function,&#10;in the evaluation of this non-trivial limit. Quite interestingly, we&#10;discover that this limit renders a redundant condition for coverage&#10;probability, thereby not yielding an explicit expression for the&#10;no-fading case. As a result, we derive a simple yet accurate&#10;approximation for coverage probability using dominant interferer-based&#10;approach in which the effect of dominant interferer is accurately&#10;captured and the aggregate interference from the rest of the interferers&#10;is carefully approximated. We then derive the bounds of the approximate&#10;coverage probability using Berry-Esseen theorem (BET) .&#10;&#10;[[PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS.]{}]{} We analyze the trends in coverage&#10;probability for different system parameters such as the altitude of the&#10;UAVs, the location of the reference receiver, the path-loss exponent of&#10;the channel, and the Nakagami- fading parameter. We demonstrate that the&#10;coverage probability of the reference receiver degrades as the altitude&#10;of the transmitting nodes increases when the area over which the&#10;transmitters are scattered remains unchanged. We also observe that the&#10;coverage probability of the reference receiver increases as the&#10;path-loss exponent of the channel increases. These observations offer&#10;useful guidelines for the system design. Several intermediate&#10;mathematical results are of general interest to the analysis of finite&#10;networks.">

<outline text="System Model" _note="We consider a network of transmitting devices (UAVs) uniformly&#10;distributed in a finite area forming a BPP. While the devices can be&#10;strategically placed to optimize the network utility, in the absence of&#10;exact traffic patterns, these optimal locations are not known, which&#10;justifies the BPP assumption. As discussed in the previous section, BPP&#10;is a finite-network analogue of a PPP, which is a popular model for&#10;infinite networks. This is a simple yet reasonable first step towards&#10;comprehensive understanding of these networks. The locations of the&#10;devices are uniformly distributed in a disk of radius centered at , as&#10;depicted in Fig. \[fig:sysmod1\]. For simplicity, we assume that all the&#10;devices are positioned at the same height . The locations of the devices&#10;are denoted by . The distance of the node from is denoted by for . The&#10;sequence of distances is unordered, which means that the indices are&#10;assigned arbitrarily to the nodes. For this setup, we perform downlink&#10;coverage analysis for a reference receiver located at some arbitrary&#10;position on the ground, at a distance of from the origin . For brevity,&#10;the [REFERENCE RECEIVER]{} will henceforth be referred to as only the&#10;[RECEIVER]{}. Since the point process is invariant to the orientation of&#10;the axes, we can assume, without loss of generality, that the receiver&#10;lies on the -axis, i.e., the location of the receiver is . The distance&#10;between the receiver and the projection of the location of transmitting&#10;device onto the ground plane is denoted by , as shown in Fig.&#10;\[fig:sysmod2\]. The angular separation between the receiver position&#10;and the projection of the device location is denoted by , which is&#10;uniformly distributed in the range . Note that and are related by the&#10;cosine rule. The receiver is assumed to connect to its closest&#10;transmitter from . The unordered set of distances from the receiver to&#10;the transmitters is denoted by . The ordered set of distances is denoted&#10;by , where is the distance between the receiver and the closest&#10;transmitter to the receiver. From this set, the serving distance is&#10;denoted by . The distance to the closest interfering node is denoted by&#10;and the unordered set of distances between the receiver and remaining&#10;interferers is denoted by .&#10;&#10;We assume that all the nodes transmit at the same power. For notational&#10;simplicity, we assume that the thermal noise is negligible as compared&#10;to the interference experienced at the receiver and is hence ignored.&#10;Owing to the limited knowledge of air-to-ground channel models for low&#10;altitude platforms, we choose Nakagami- fading, which is a generalized&#10;model that mimics various fading environments. We denote the Nakagami-&#10;fading parameter for the serving link and interfering links by and ,&#10;respectively. We restrict the values of to integers for analytical&#10;tractability. The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the receiver is&#10;where is the path-loss exponent, and and are channel fading gains&#10;corresponding to serving and interfering links.

<outline text="Coverage Probability" _note="In this section, we derive the coverage probability for the setup&#10;introduced in the previous section. Using properties of gamma function,&#10;we will express it in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform of&#10;interference power distribution. We also attempt to obtain the coverage&#10;probability for no-fading channel from the results of Nakagami- fading&#10;by taking the limits and . Quite interestingly, we discover that this&#10;limit renders a redundant condition for coverage probability, thereby&#10;not yielding an explicit expression for the no-fading case. Hence, we&#10;provide an alternate approach to compute the coverage probability in&#10;this case by approximating the aggregate interference from devices other&#10;than the dominant interferer with a normal random variable and capturing&#10;the effect of dominant interferer exactly.">
  <outline text="Relevant Distance Distributions" _note="We begin our analysis by characterizing the distribution of distances&#10;between the receiver and the transmitters in this subsection. While&#10;somewhat similar expositions about distance distributions can be found&#10;in  in the context of terrestrial networks, the distributions&#10;corresponding to the dominant interferer-based approach are unique to&#10;this paper because this paper is the first one to apply that approach to&#10;the analysis of finite cellular networks.&#10;&#10;\[lem:cdfwi\] The distances from the receiver to the set of&#10;independently and uniformly distributed transmitting devices, denoted by&#10;, conditioned on , are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.),&#10;with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of each element given by&#10;with where&#10;&#10;See Appendix \[app:cdfwi\].&#10;&#10;\[lem:pdfwi\] The PDF of conditioned on is with where&#10;&#10; can be derived by taking the derivative of from Lemma \[lem:cdfwi\]&#10;with respect to .&#10;&#10;For a receiver located at the origin , this piece-wise expression for&#10;the PDF reduces to a simple expression, which is given in the following&#10;Corollary.&#10;&#10;The set of distances from a receiver located at the origin to the&#10;transmitting devices are i.i.d. with the PDF of each element given by&#10;&#10;\[lem:pdfu1\] The PDF of the serving distance conditioned on is with&#10;&#10;See Appendix \[app:pdfu1\].&#10;&#10;If the receiver is located at the origin, the above result reduces to a&#10;simple expression, which is given in the next Corollary.&#10;&#10;The PDF of the serving distance for a receiver located at the origin is&#10;&#10;We now derive the distribution of distance between the receiver and&#10;interferers, conditioned on the serving distance . This distribution&#10;will be useful in characterizing the interference experienced at the&#10;receiver.&#10;&#10;\[lem:pdfuigu1\] Conditioned on the serving distance , the unordered set&#10;of distances between the interferers and the receiver, , are i.i.d. with&#10;the PDF of each element given by with&#10;&#10;See Appendix \[app:pdfuigu1\].&#10;&#10;For the case where the receiver is located at the origin, the&#10;conditional PDF of distances between the receiver and the interferers is&#10;given in the following Corollary.&#10;&#10;For a receiver situated at the origin, the PDF of distances between the&#10;receiver and the interferers conditioned on the serving distance is&#10;given by&#10;&#10;We now characterize the joint distribution of serving distance and the&#10;distance between the receiver and the dominant interferer . This&#10;distribution holds the key to the derivation of approximate coverage&#10;probability using the dominant interferer approach (for the no-fading&#10;case) as discussed in the sequel. Note that the dominant interferer in&#10;the absence of fading is the second closest transmitter to the receiver.&#10;Since it is easy to visualize and understand these cases in two&#10;dimensions, we consider the projections of the transmitting nodes onto&#10;the ground plane. We will then use these results to derive the&#10;distributions in the actual three-dimensional setup. Let the distance&#10;from the receiver to the projections of locations of serving transmitter&#10;and dominant interferer be denoted by and , respectively. Using the same&#10;argument as presented in Lemma \[lem:pdfuigu1\], the piece-wise nature&#10;of joint distribution of and can be attributed to the following three&#10;cases: (i) both the disks and are entirely contained in the disk , (ii)&#10;the disk is entirely contained in , while overlaps only partially with ,&#10;and (iii) both the disks and overlap only partially with . Note that the&#10;converse of case (ii) is not valid since .&#10;&#10;\[lem:jpdfu1u2\] The conditional joint PDF of serving distance and the&#10;distance of the dominant interferer from the receiver is given by with&#10;&#10;See Appendix \[app:jpdfu1u2\].&#10;&#10;For the case where the receiver is at the origin, this result reduces to&#10;a simple expression, which is given in the next Corollary.&#10;&#10;For a receiver located at the origin, the joint PDF of the serving&#10;distance and the distance of the dominant interferer from the receiver&#10;is&#10;&#10;We now determine the distribution of the set of distances between the&#10;receiver and the interferers , conditioned on the serving distance , and&#10;the distance of the dominant interferer from the receiver . Let the&#10;distances from the receiver to the projections of remaining interferers&#10;be denoted by . The piece-wise distribution of these distances depends&#10;on the following four cases: (i) all the disks , , and are completely&#10;contained in , (ii) the disks and are completely contained in , while&#10;the disks overlap only partially with , (iii) the disk is completely&#10;contained in the disk , while and partially overlap with , and (iv) all&#10;the disks , , and overlap partially with . Note that other combinations&#10;are not valid because .&#10;&#10;\[lem:pdfui\] Conditioned on the serving distance and the distance of&#10;the dominant interferer from the receiver , the set of distances between&#10;the remaining interferers and the receiver, , are i.i.d. with the PDF of&#10;each element given by with&#10;&#10;The proof follows along the same lines as that of Lemma&#10;\[lem:pdfuigu1\].&#10;&#10;The following Corollary gives the conditional PDF of distances of&#10;interferers from the receiver for the special case where the receiver is&#10;located at the origin.&#10;&#10;Conditioned on the serving distance and the distance of the dominant&#10;interferer from the receiver , the set of distances between the receiver&#10;and the interferers, , are i.i.d. with the PDF of each element given by&#10;&#10;Now that we have determined the necessary distance distributions, we&#10;will proceed to derive the coverage probability for the receiver under&#10;Nakagami- fading in the following subsection.">

  <outline text="Coverage Probability under Nakagami- Fading Channels" _note="The coverage probability is formally defined as the probability with&#10;which the SIR at the receiver exceeds a pre-determined threshold&#10;necessary for a successful communication.

  <outline text="Limiting Case of No-fading" _note="In this subsection, we attempt to derive the coverage probability for a&#10;no-fading environment from the results of Nakagami- fading by applying&#10;the limits and . This approach has mostly been overlooked in the&#10;literature due to the complexity of the results of Nakagami- fading. A&#10;partial attempt to compute this limit was made in  where the limit is&#10;applied only on the interfering links but not on the desired link. We&#10;show that it is more challenging to evaluate the limit for the desired&#10;link . Our analysis will rely on an asymptotic expansion of incomplete&#10;gamma function.&#10;&#10;From our approach, we observe that it is convenient to take this limit&#10;in one of the intermediate steps in the derivation of under Nakagami-&#10;fading. Substituting in , we get the conditional coverage probability in&#10;Nakagami- fading as follows: where (a) follows from switching the order&#10;of differentiation and expectation by applying Dominated Convergence&#10;Theorem (DCT) . Therefore, the coverage probability conditioned on and&#10;can now be written as The results obtained upon applying the limits on&#10;the conditional coverage probability are given in the following Theorem.&#10;&#10;The coverage probability of the receiver for a no-fading channel&#10;conditioned on the serving distance and the set of interfering distances&#10;is where .&#10;&#10;Applying limits and in , we get the conditional coverage probability as&#10;where (a) follows from applying the limit before differentiation and&#10;writing the limit of product as product of limits, and (b) follows from&#10;the derivative of exponential function followed by the substitution .&#10;&#10;Now, we apply the limit to the above equation. Although the expression&#10;in resembles the Taylor series expansion of exponential function, it is&#10;not possible to directly take the limit as both the limit of the&#10;summation and the summand approach . This problem has been well studied&#10;in Mathematics  in relation to incomplete gamma function and this sum is&#10;asymptotically equal to the following function. For completeness, the&#10;proof of this asymptotic expansion is provided in Appendix \[app:igf\].&#10;Applying the limit , we see that the limit converges to three values&#10;depending on the range of . This completes the proof.&#10;&#10;We notice that the condition under which the coverage probability&#10;converges to 1 is , i.e., . This is nothing but the condition of in&#10;no-fading channels. Therefore, quite interestingly, we obtain only a&#10;redundant condition when the coverage probability in no-fading channels&#10;is evaluated from the results of Nakagami- fading. To the best of our&#10;understanding, this insight has not been reported before in the context&#10;of the limiting case of Nakagami- fading. In the next subsection, we&#10;provide an accurate approximation to compute coverage probability in the&#10;absence of fading.">

Using this result,&#10;along with the first and second moments of , we derive the bounds of&#10;coverage probability in the following Theorem.&#10;&#10;\[thm:bounds\] The coverage probabilty of the receiver, at a distance&#10;from the origin, is bounded as with where is the CDF of standard normal&#10;distribution, , is the variance given in Lemma \[lem:varI\] and is the&#10;third moment given by Lemma \[lem:rho\].&#10;&#10;See Appendix \[app:bounds\].&#10;&#10;While these bounds are loose for very small values of , we observe that&#10;the error between the normal distribution and true distribution&#10;decreases at the rate . In other words, as the number of transmitting&#10;devices grows to a large value, the approximate coverage probability&#10;converges to the actual value. However, in the next section, we show&#10;that this approximation is surprisingly accurate even for a small number&#10;of nodes in the network.">

In addition to providing useful design insights,&#10;we also discuss the applicability of our proposed analytic approaches to&#10;an urban setting in which the visibility of some UAVs is&#10;obstructed/blocked by buildings.">
  <outline text="Numerical Results" _note="We simulate a finite network of UAVs with , uniformly distributed in a&#10;disk of radius km. We evaluate the coverage probability for different&#10;system parameters and compare them with the theoretical results obtained&#10;in Theorems \[thm:pcm\] and \[thm:clt\]. We find that our theoretical&#10;results match exactly with the simulations as shown in Fig.&#10;\[fig:impactm\]. The key factors that affect the coverage probability&#10;are: (i) channel fading parameter , (ii) path-loss exponent , (iii) the&#10;height of UAVs , and (iv) the distance of the receiver from the origin .&#10;We study the impact of each parameter on the coverage probability in the&#10;rest of this Subsection.&#10;&#10;[IMPACT OF FADING]{}. We compute the coverage probability of the&#10;receiver as a function of SIR threshold for and . Note that is nothing&#10;but the no-fading scenario. The other parameters of the simulation are&#10;km, km, and . As expected, the variance of SIR decreases with the&#10;increase in . In other words, SIR starts [CONCENTRATING]{} as we move&#10;from Rayleigh fading () case to the no-fading () case.&#10;&#10;[IMPACT OF PATH-LOSS EXPONENT]{}. We study the impact of path-loss&#10;exponent on coverage in Fig. \[fig:impacta\], where we plot the coverage&#10;probability as a function of threshold for different values of . The&#10;simulations are run for km, , and km. It can be observed that the&#10;coverage probability degrades with a decrease in the path-loss exponent.&#10;While reducing increases the received power of the desired signal, it&#10;also increases the interference power, thereby degrading the overall SIR&#10;and hence the coverage probability.&#10;&#10;[IMPACT OF HEIGHT]{}. We compare the coverage probability of the&#10;receiver as a function of threshold for different values of the height&#10;of UAVs (2, 4, 6, and 8 km) . The other simulation parameters were fixed&#10;at , , and km. It can be observed from Fig. \[fig:impacth\] that the&#10;coverage probability deteriorates as the height of the UAVs increases.&#10;An increase in the height of UAVs increases the distance between the&#10;receiver and the transmitters. Intuitively, when viewed from a receiver&#10;that moves away from the transmitters, the separation between the&#10;serving and interfering nodes tends to diminish. This worsens the SIR&#10;and hence the coverage.&#10;&#10;[IMPACT OF RECEIVER DISTANCE FROM THE ORIGIN]{}. The impact of receiver&#10;distance from the origin on coverage probability can be studied from&#10;Fig. \[fig:impactx0\] where we plot coverage as a function of for&#10;different values of . The other simulation parameters were km, , dB, and&#10;.

  <outline text="Applicability of the Proposed Results to a Relevant Urban Model" _note="As discussed already, the main technical objective of this paper was to&#10;develop a comprehensive framework for the analysis of a reasonable&#10;canonical model for finite UAV networks. Before concluding this Section,&#10;we demonstrate that this canonical model can be enriched to some extent&#10;while retaining its tractability. In particular, we incorporate the&#10;effect of shadowing/blocking due to high-rises that will be prominent in&#10;urban regions, especially at higher frequencies. The system setup is&#10;illustrated in Fig. \[fig:sysmod4\]. The blockages may result in&#10;attenuation of the received signal and hence affect the coverage&#10;probability. We begin with the spatial model considered in this paper,&#10;where transmitting devices are uniformly distributed in a disk at an&#10;altitude above the ground. Due to the presence of buildings, all the&#10;UAVs may not be [VISIBLE]{} at the receiver. We denote the number of&#10;visible UAVs by . In our [ANALYTICAL]{} treatment, we assume that the&#10;LOS paths from the receiver to each UAV are blocked independently of&#10;each other. In other words, we ignore the correlation in blocking&#10;introduced by the spatial distribution of buildings in the area. As a&#10;result, can be modeled as a binomial random variable. This&#10;[INDEPENDENCE]{} assumption will be validated through a numerical&#10;comparison in Fig. \[fig:impactb\].&#10;&#10;For simplicity, we limit our discussion to direct path propagation and&#10;ignore multi-path fading. We assume that if a UAV is hidden behind a&#10;building, its signal is attenuated by a fixed factor . While we can&#10;easily extend this discussion to a more general setup, this simple&#10;scenario is sufficient to fix the key ideas. For this setup, the&#10;received signal power from the transmitter, located at a distance from&#10;the receiver is , where if the UAV is visible at the receiver and&#10;otherwise. Recall that the distribution of is given by Lemma&#10;\[lem:pdfwi\]. Now conditioned on , we get two independent BPPs: (i) a&#10;BPP formed by visible UAVs, and (ii) a BPP formed by blocked UAVs.&#10;Conditional on , the coverage analysis can be performed following the&#10;proposed approach. We do not go into the mathematical details due to&#10;lack of space. Note that if , we get only one BPP (of visible UAVs),&#10;which reduces this setup to that of Theorem \[thm:clt\], which will be&#10;used for numerical comparisons below.&#10;&#10;The key approximation made in the above analysis is the [INDEPENDENT&#10;BLOCKING]{} assumption. We validate this assumption numerically. In&#10;particular, we simulate a urban scenario in MATLAB with 5 UAVs uniformly&#10;distributed over a circular area of radius of 10 km. We assume a uniform&#10;distribution of 50 buildings that are of dimensions m m m. We choose the&#10;simple case of , i.e., we receive signals from only those UAVs that are&#10;visible. For a receiver at a distance of 1 km from the origin and&#10;path-loss exponent of , we obtain the coverage probability from&#10;simulations. For each realization, we numerically obtain , which is used&#10;instead of in Theorem \[thm:clt\] to obtain the conditional coverage&#10;probability analytically. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to average&#10;over . Note that the purpose of this comparison is to show that the&#10;independent blocking assumption is reasonable. This is quite evident in&#10;the results presented in Fig. \[fig:impactb\], where the simulation&#10;results are the ones obtained from actual numerical experiments without&#10;any assumptions, and the analytical result is obtained under independent&#10;blocking assumption.

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive downlink coverage&#10;analysis for a finite three-dimensional wireless network formed by UAVs.&#10;Modeling the network of UAVs as a BPP, we characterized the distribution&#10;of distances from the receiver to the serving and interfering nodes. We&#10;first derived an exact expression for coverage probability for the&#10;reference receiver under independent Nakagami- fading channels in terms&#10;of the derivatives of the Laplace transform of interference power&#10;distribution. Using asymptotic expansion of incomplete gamma function,&#10;we showed that the coverage probability for an important special case of&#10;no-fading cannot be obtained explicitly as the limiting case of&#10;Nakagami- fading by taking the limit . As a result, we developed an&#10;alternate approach to compute the approximate coverage probability in&#10;which the interference from dominant interferer is modeled exactly and&#10;the distribution of residual interference from other interferers is&#10;approximated to a normal distribution by CLT. We then obtained the&#10;bounds of the approximate coverage probability using Berry-Esseen&#10;theorem, which quantifies the rate of convergence of the normal&#10;approximation to the true distribution. Our analysis revealed several&#10;useful performance trends in terms of the heights of the UAVs and&#10;channel propagation characteristics. We also discussed a possible&#10;extension of the proposed canonical model to a simple urban scenario in&#10;which the the UAVs are shadowed by high-rises.&#10;&#10;This work has numerous extensions. The mathematical tools developed in&#10;the paper can be applied to the analysis of more general&#10;three-dimensional finite networks. The setup studied in this paper can&#10;also be extended to study the co-existence of UAV networks and&#10;terrestrial cellular networks. From modeling perspective, a useful&#10;direction of work wold be to develop more sophisticated but tractable&#10;three-dimensional spatial models that account for the curvature of the&#10;earth. In terms of performance evaluation, the proposed framework can be&#10;used to study other useful metrics besides coverage, such as throughput&#10;and energy efficiency.">
