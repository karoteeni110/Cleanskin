<outline text="Introduction" _note="The Casimir effect constitutes a paradigmatic example of dispersion&#10;force between neutral bodies, induced by quantum fluctuations of the&#10;electromagnetic field. Since their discovery , Casimir and&#10;Casimir-Polder forces have had a large impact in the fields of physics,&#10;chemistry, biology and nanotechnology . The basics of the Casimir effect&#10;has recently attracted renewed interest, as a result of a large amount&#10;of experimental work allowing for precision measurements, and of the&#10;observation of disagreements between the results of these experiments&#10;and theoretical predictions . Most precise measurements of the Casimir&#10;force are performed between large spheres and metallic plates separated&#10;in distances ranging from a fraction of micrometer to a few micrometers.&#10;The force is dominated by zero-point quantum fluctuations of the&#10;electromagnetic field at separations much smaller than the thermal&#10;wavelength (m at room temperature), whereas thermal fluctuations also&#10;contribute at larger separations. In both cases, the magnitude of the&#10;force depends on the reflection properties of the sphere and plate,&#10;which themselves depend on the complex dielectric function of the&#10;materials. In metals, the low-frequency limit of the latter is&#10;controlled by the conductivity, that is in practice by the Drude&#10;description of electron scattering from the metal impurities. The most&#10;precise measurements performed at submicrometric separations appear to&#10;be in good agreement with the so-called plasma model, that is the Drude&#10;model with dissipation discarded . In contrast, experiments performed at&#10;larger distances of a few micrometers (i.e. at separations approaching )&#10;obtain results in good agreement with the dissipative Drude model, after&#10;a large contribution of electrostatic effets is substracted . To the&#10;best of our knowledge, this intriguing contradiction on the role of&#10;dissipation in Casimir experiments has not yet been solved, though a&#10;number of potential explanations has already been investigated .&#10;&#10;In this Letter we propose to study a new effect, related to the&#10;fluctuations of the Casimir-Polder (CP) force, which could help to&#10;improve our understanding of the role of dissipation in Casimir physics.&#10;Considering the geometry of a small sphere (or an atom) located at a&#10;distance above a plane metallic plate, we study the NON-SPECULAR&#10;contribution to the CP interaction potential (from which the force is&#10;derived), which is inherently connected with electron relaxation within&#10;the metal. In practice, this contribution manifests itself as a spatial&#10;fluctuation of the potential around a mean value as the sphere is moved&#10;above the plate at fixed separation. Alternatively, by virtue of the&#10;ergodicity principle, can also be seen as a fluctuation from sample to&#10;sample of the Casimir interaction potential between a sphere and&#10;macroscopically identical –but microscopically different– metallic&#10;plates. Physically, the mean CP potential is mediated by the field&#10;fluctuations specularly reflected from the surface of the metal. The&#10;space-varying fluctuation , on the other hand, stems from the part of&#10;the radiation that is re-emitted NON SPECULARLY, as illustrated in Fig.&#10;\[illustration\], after having penetrated the metal and interacted with&#10;electrons scattered in the disordered metallic bulk. Due to this&#10;mechanism, the very existence of the fluctuating part of the Casimir&#10;force relies on the presence of impurities in the metallic plate, and&#10;thus constitutes a natural probe of dissipation.&#10;&#10;In the following, we provide for the first time a detailed description&#10;of these spatial fluctuations for a metallic plate, which turn out to be&#10;richer than the fluctuations arising with dielectric disordered&#10;materials . We discover that unlike the mean CP potential, at and large&#10;distances the variation of these fluctuations with the sphere-plate&#10;separation distance significantly depends on the amount of dissipation&#10;in the metallic bulk. Furthermore, by analyzing at finite temperature,&#10;we come up with the surprising result that fluctuations decay&#10;exponentially with the sphere-plate separation, in strong contrast with&#10;the behavior of mean Casimir potentials that decay algebraically.">

<outline text="Scattering approach" _note="Let us consider the CP interaction potential between a small resonant&#10;dielectric sphere of polarizability , located at a distance from a&#10;semi-infinite metallic plate. The choice of a dielectric sphere is made&#10;for simplicity, and does not involve any loss of generality. All the&#10;results presented in the Letter apply to a two-level atom or a small&#10;metallic sphere as well, the role of the resonant frequency being then&#10;played by the plasma frequency of the sphere. At zero temperature and in&#10;the dipolar approximation for the sphere, is given by where is the&#10;reflection coefficient of the plate, describing scattering of an&#10;incoming mode with transverse wave vector and polarization vector into&#10;an outgoing mode , at frequency . are polarization indices, and . Within&#10;an effective-medium description, the metal is purely homogeneous and&#10;electromagnetic fields are specularly reflected from the surface, with&#10;reflection amplitudes , where are the Fresnel coefficients of the&#10;vacuum-metal interface. These coefficients depend on the (Drude) complex&#10;permittivity of the metal, , where is the plasma frequency and the&#10;electron relaxation rate in the metal. At large separations , this leads&#10;to the known result . Note that this relation is independent of , and in&#10;particular holds when (plasma model).&#10;&#10; is not the only contribution to . Indeed, the presence of impurities in&#10;the metal makes the CP potential fluctuate spatially around its mean&#10;value . The fluctuating contribution stems from electromagnetic fields&#10;that enter the metallic bulk and are reflected through their interaction&#10;with conduction electrons scattered from impurities. We describe by&#10;adding a non-specular contribution to the reflection coefficient, ,&#10;which we calculate by making use of a statistical approach where the&#10;metallic plate is taken from a random ensemble of plates with different&#10;microscopic configurations of the impurity positions. The magnitude of&#10;potential fluctuations is then given by the variance , where the overbar&#10;denotes averaging over the random ensemble. To evaluate , we square Eq.&#10;(\[EqU\]), substract and apply the configuration average. We obtain: Eq.&#10;(\[deltaUdef\]) involves the correlator of reflection coefficients ,&#10;whose diagrammatic representation is shown in Fig. \[diagrams\]a.&#10;&#10;The outer branch of the diagram describes the following physical&#10;mechanism: an electromagnetic field fluctuation of frequency penetrates&#10;the metal, then accelerates an electron at some point . This electron&#10;propagates through the metal up to a final point where it re-emits a&#10;radiation that eventually leaves the metal. The inner branch of the&#10;diagram describes a similar process at frequency . The correlator stems&#10;from the fact that the two electron scattering trajectories from to and&#10;from to can share one or several metal impurities. These trajectories&#10;are described by the conductivity fluctuations and , so that their&#10;correlation is in turn encoded in the correlator . The diagram in Fig.&#10;\[diagrams\]a explicitly reads: In this expression, is the&#10;electromagnetic Green function that describes propagation of a radiation&#10;with polarization and transverse (resp. longitudinal) wave vector ()&#10;from the vacuum-metal interface to the point in the metal (with similar&#10;definitions for , and ). The longitudinal wave number is the one in the&#10;metal, defined as (and similarly for ). is the Fresnel transmission&#10;coefficient from the vacuum to the metal, and is the Fresnel refection&#10;coefficient from the metal to the metal (from now on, we omit the&#10;frequency dependence of these coefficients to lighten the notations).&#10;Physically, accounts for the finite probability for a field fluctuation&#10;to penetrate the metal, while accounts for the possibility for a field&#10;fluctuation inside the metal to be internally reflected from the&#10;surface. To evaluate the conductivity correlator in Eq.&#10;(\[dr\_dr\_def\]), we assume that the material is weakly disordered,&#10;i.e. that , which is an excellent approximation for usual metals. The&#10;main contribution of the conductivity correlator to is then due to&#10;electron trajectories correlated via a SINGLE impurity , as&#10;diagramatically shown in Fig. \[diagrams\]b. Evaluation of this diagram&#10;leads to (see for a more general discussion of conductivity correlations&#10;in metals): where is the electron mean free path ( with the Fermi&#10;velocity), the Fermi wavelength and is the Drude conductivity. To derive&#10;Eq. (\[ds\_ds\]), we have neglected the finite range and anisotropic&#10;structure of the conductivity correlator . Taking into account this&#10;structure is not necessary here, as it would eventually give rise to&#10;relative corrections to smaller by a factor . By reporting Eq.&#10;(\[ds\_ds\]) into (\[dr\_dr\_def\]), we obtain where , are the Fresnel&#10;transmission coefficients from the metal to the vacuum. The Dirac delta&#10;function that appears in Eq. (\[dr\_dr\]) signals momentum conservation&#10;of the total scattering process.">

<outline text="Results" _note="By computing using Eqs. (\[deltaUdef\]) and (\[dr\_dr\]), we obtain the&#10;final expression where . The prefactor describes the interaction of the&#10;electromagnetic field with conduction electrons in the metal, and&#10;quantifies the strength of relative fluctuations. Its physical&#10;interpretation will be elucidated later. At this stage, let us mention&#10;that the function remains finite when (see below). Therefore, since ,&#10;the fluctuating part of the CP potential vanishes when . This is&#10;required since the spatial fluctuations of find their origin in the&#10;metal heterogeneities, encoded in . We note that this important property&#10;was not fulfilled in a recent work by Allocca et al. , who used a&#10;diffusion approximation to describe electronic motion in a metal. Such&#10;an approximation is inadequate in the context of the Casimir effect&#10;because it underestimates the weight of short electron scattering&#10;trajectories, which turn out to be the dominant ones . The function is&#10;displayed in Fig. \[Drude\_vs\_Plasma\] (blue dots). For comparison, we&#10;also show the same function in the limit where (red dots), calculated&#10;using the plasma limit for the mean permittivity . For simplicity we&#10;here set , so that only two characteristic length scales remain in the&#10;problem, the plasma wavelength and the relaxation wavelength . Overall,&#10;is a decaying function of , which confirms the intuition that the sphere&#10;tends to average out the metal heterogeneities at large separations.&#10;&#10;At small separations , we find . This characteristic scaling is not&#10;surprising, as it is reminiscent to what has been found recently for&#10;spatial fluctuations of CP forces above dielectric disordered plates .&#10;Indeed, small separations are described by large frequencies where the&#10;electromagnetic field penetrates easily the metal, which thus behaves&#10;similarly to a dielectric material.&#10;&#10;A quick look at the two curves in Fig. \[Drude\_vs\_Plasma\] also&#10;indicates that the function does not depend much on at small separations&#10;. This can be qualitatively understood from the coincidence of both the&#10;plasma and the Drude models for the mean permittivity at large&#10;frequencies: whatever . In strong contrast, a very interesting behavior&#10;shows up at large separations where the variation of starts to&#10;qualitatively depend on . This is well visible in Fig.&#10;\[Drude\_vs\_Plasma\_zoom\], which focuses on the range . This&#10;observation is also confirmed by an asymptotic analysis of at large&#10;separations, which yields:&#10;&#10;[(z)=]{} c\_1()\^4 &amp; \[Fz\_asymptoticsa\]\&#10;c\_2()\^4()\^[9/2]{}&amp; \[Fz\_asymptoticsb\]&#10;&#10;where and are numerical constants. These asymptotic limits are shown in&#10;Fig. \[Drude\_vs\_Plasma\_zoom\] as dashed lines, and describe very well&#10;the exact numerical results. Eqs. (\[Fz\_asymptoticsa\]-b) constitute an&#10;important result of the Letter. They indicate that at large separations,&#10;the variance of the CP potential has a different scaling with depending&#10;on . In other words, the fluctuations achieve values that differ by&#10;orders of magnitude depending on the amount of dissipation in the metal.&#10;This behavior can be traced back to the low-frequency asymptotics of the&#10;mean permittivity , which is crucially affected by . Eq. (\[dr\_dr\])&#10;depends on through the wave numbers and Fresnel coefficients. At low&#10;frequencies, while and when , and in the limit . This shows again that&#10;the spatial fluctuations of Casimir-Polder forces could be used as an&#10;efficient probe to unambiguously assess the effect of dissipation in the&#10;Casimir effect in metals.&#10;&#10;So far we have discussed only zero temperature. The effect of finite&#10;temperatures can be simply accounted for by replacing the frequency&#10;integral in Eq. (\[EqU\]) by a discrete sum over Matsubara frequencies.&#10;This modifies the mean Casimir interaction potential at large distances,&#10;according to The calculation of the variance at follows the same lines&#10;as at , except that it involves a DOUBLE sum over Matsubara frequencies&#10;and , where are integers running from 0 to . At finite temperature, we&#10;find that the general form (\[deltaU\_U\]) still holds, with the&#10;function now modified at separations as compared to the results of Fig.&#10;\[Drude\_vs\_Plasma\].&#10;&#10; is shown in the main panel of Fig. \[RFluctuations\_T\] at (blue dots).&#10;For definiteness we set . Points such that are identical to those in&#10;Fig. \[Drude\_vs\_Plasma\]. At large separations however, temperature&#10;gives rise to a collapse of spatial fluctuations. A plot of in log scale&#10;(inset of Fig. \[RFluctuations\_T\]) suggests that this decay is close&#10;to EXPONENTIAL. Finite temperatures thus turn out to average out the&#10;spatial fluctuations of the Casimir force. To better understand this&#10;intriguing result, we have also investigated the regime analytically. As&#10;is well known, for the mean potential this limit is controlled by the&#10;zeroth-order Matsubara frequency term in the sum, which turns out to be&#10;nonzero and reduces to Eq. (\[Ubar\_FiniteT\]). The situation is very&#10;different for the variance , for which we find that the contributions&#10;involving zero-order Matsubara frequencies ( or ) identically VANISH.&#10;One can already guess this result from the expression of the correlator&#10;of reflection coefficients, Eq. (\[dr\_dr\]), which falls to zero when&#10;or . Because the term ( or ) is identically zero, the large-separation&#10;asymptotics of is naturally governed by the first-order contribution .&#10;This term can be explicitly calculated by means of a saddle-point&#10;approximation, leading to where . This asymptote is shown in the inset&#10;of Fig. \[RFluctuations\_T\] as a dashed line, and matches well the&#10;exact numerical calculation. Note that the exponential decay of&#10;fluctuations is controlled by the thermal wavelength, the dissipation&#10;appearing only through the prefactor . The result (\[Asymptotics\_T\])&#10;is remarkably different from the algebraic decay of , Eq.&#10;(\[Ubar\_FiniteT\]). At a very qualitative level, it can be understood&#10;by the argument that in the strict limit of zero frequency, the&#10;electromagnetic field (of infinite wavelength) cannot resolve the&#10;spatial heterogeneities (impurities) of the metal. The contribution of&#10;zeroth-order Matsubara frequency to the fluctuation must therefore be&#10;zero. We expect this argument to be universal, independent of the&#10;details of the material like the type of impurities or the value of the&#10;mean free path. It does of course not hold for the mean Casimir&#10;potential , which finds its origin in the reflection of the&#10;electromagnetic field from the purely HOMOGENEOUS surface of the metal,&#10;so that even a field of infinite wavelength can contribute to .&#10;&#10;Having discussed how fluctuations behave as a function of the separation&#10;distance, let us now comment on the physical interpretation of the&#10;prefactor in Eq. (\[deltaU\_U\]), which controls their magnitude. Over a&#10;time span , one can associate to an electron trajectory in the metal an&#10;effective, classical tube of length and cross-section . This tube has a&#10;volume . Since a finite variance arises due to correlations between&#10;electron scattering trajectories (see Fig. \[diagrams\]), we have to&#10;estimate the probability for a crossing between to such tubes to take&#10;place. This probability is given by the ratio of to the effective volume&#10;of the metal accessible to the electromagnetic field. Over the same time&#10;span , the field can transversally propagate over a surface and it can&#10;penetrate the metal up to a distance (the typical skin depth), giving .&#10;The probability of crossing after a time is thus . If we finally note&#10;that the typical time scale for electron relaxation is , that and , we&#10;recover the prefactor in Eq. (\[deltaU\_U\]).">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In conclusion, we have described for the first time the spatial&#10;fluctuations of CP forces above metals. As these fluctuations are&#10;triggered by electron scattering, their observation would constitute a&#10;natural probe of dissipation in the Casimir effect. Furthermore, we have&#10;shown that their dependence on the sphere-plate separation depends&#10;significantly on the low-frequency description of the metal&#10;permittivity. For gold, a free electron density   and an elastic mean&#10;free path nm  lead to for the magnitude of spatial fluctuations, which&#10;are thus typically small. Conditions more favorable for the observation&#10;of these spatial fluctuations can nevertheless be achieved by lowering&#10;the mean free path. For instance, nichrome is a nickel-chromium alloy&#10;used in resistive wires. It has nm  at room temperature and . This leads&#10;to spatial fluctuations that are than an order of magnitude larger than&#10;for gold. Alternatively, disordered thick films traditionally used in&#10;mesoscopic physics could be promising candidates for experimentally&#10;unveiling these fluctuations .&#10;&#10;We thank Christophe Texier for useful discussions on the physics of&#10;conductivity correlations in disordered metals.&#10;&#10;[0]{}&#10;&#10;H.
