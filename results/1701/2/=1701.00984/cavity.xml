<outline text="Introduction" _note="The interaction of a single emitter with the quantized radiation-field&#10;in a high- cavity serves as a basic ingredient in various schemes in&#10;quantum information science (for a review see, e.g., Ref. ). In this&#10;context, an essential prerequisite for quantum information processing &#10;is the deterministic generation of indistinguishable light pulses of&#10;one-photon Fock states on demand with well-controlled features, such as&#10;efficiency, frequency, polarization, timing etc.. Among the various&#10;features of single-photon emission, control and manipulation of the&#10;spatiotemporal shape of the single-photon light pulses is essential for&#10;quantum network applications where symmetric wavepackets are required&#10;for a time reversal of the emission process  or where time-bin&#10;entanglement is used .&#10;&#10;The most prominent way to generate single-photon Fock states in&#10;high-finesse optical cavities interacting with single emitters is based&#10;on vacuum stimulated Raman adiabatic approach (vSTIRAP) technique . A&#10;single transition of an emitter with a -type energy level scheme is&#10;excited by a pump laser stimulating the emission into a strongly coupled&#10;cavity–emitter transition. Alongside the principal realizations of&#10;vSTIRAP in atomic systems (see e.g. ), a -type scheme can be also&#10;implemented in semiconductor quantum dot–microcavity systems, where a&#10;-type system is created by applying a strong magnetic field to a singly&#10;charged quantum dot resulting in Zeeman splitting of the spin states in&#10;the conduction band  or by applying a lateral electric field which&#10;charges a single quantum dot with a single electron resulting in optical&#10;transitions between ground and excited electron states and the charged&#10;exciton . In particular, in atomic systems control of the photon&#10;frequency , wavepacket length  and phase  have been reported. The&#10;efficiency of the generation of single-photon Fock states in a scheme&#10;based on vSTIRAP technique is governed by an interplay of various system&#10;parameters, such as the transition dipole matrix element, intensity and&#10;amplitude of the pump pulse, frequency detuning etc. Further, it has&#10;also been reported that the spatiotemporal shapes of the outgoing wave&#10;packets of the emitted one-photon Fock state radiation follow the&#10;driving laser pulse shapes . However, this behavior is only observed for&#10;a certain range of parameters and the efficiency of one-photon Fock&#10;state generation is very low, which makes it impossible to use the&#10;scheme for further applications in quantum communications. More&#10;recently, the possibility of generation of single-photon wave packets&#10;with arbitrary shapes in the case when the atom–cavity interaction&#10;remains constant during the generation process has been demonstrated&#10;both theoretically, on using the master equation formalism for&#10;describing the atom–photon system , and experimentally, with un-trapped&#10;atoms injected into a cavity by means of an atomic fountain .&#10;&#10;In an earlier work, we have studied the potential of a single two-level&#10;atom in a high- cavity as a single-photon emitter, where the wave packet&#10;associated with the emitted photon is shorter than the cavity decay&#10;time . Within the frame of exact quantum electrodynamics, we have&#10;particularly shown the feasibility of the generation of single-photon&#10;wave packets with time-symmetric spatiotemporal shapes. In the present&#10;article we extend the theory to the interaction of a pumped three-level&#10;-type emitter with a realistic cavity-assisted quantized electromagnetic&#10;field, with the aim of well-defined and controlled one-photon Fock-state&#10;emission. In particular, we study in detail both the properties of the&#10;excited outgoing wave packet and the efficiency to prepare it in a&#10;single-photon Fock state. The general explicit expression derived for&#10;the spatiotemporal shape of the excited outgoing wave packet allows us&#10;to study different coupling regimes of the emitter–pump and the&#10;emitter–cavity-field interactions. In this context, we show the&#10;possibility to generate single-photon wave packets with requested&#10;spatiotemporal shapes, which can be achieved by using appropriately&#10;designed driving laser pulses.&#10;&#10;The paper is organized as follows. The basic equations for the resonant&#10;interaction of an emitter with a cavity-assisted electromagnetic field&#10;are given in Sec. \[sec2\]. In Sec. \[sec3\] the Wigner function of the&#10;quantum state the excited outgoing wave packet is prepared in and the&#10;spatiotemporal shape of the wave packet are studied for the case of a&#10;classically pumped three-level -type emitter. Section \[sec7\] is&#10;devoted to the problem of generating single-photon wave packets of&#10;desired shapes. A summary and some concluding remarks are given in&#10;Sec. \[sec9\].">

  <outline text="Pumped three-level -type emitter in a cavity" _note="Let us consider a single atom-like emitter placed in a resonator cavity&#10;and assume that only a single transition (, frequency ) is quasi&#10;resonantly coupled to a narrow-band cavity-assisted electromagnetic&#10;field (frequency ), cf. Fig. \[fig1\]. We further assume, that an&#10;external (classical) pump field with quasi resonant frequency and&#10;(time-dependent) Rabi frequency is applied to the transition (frequency&#10;), cf. Fig. \[fig1\]. For the sake of simplicity of presentation, we&#10;restrict our treatment to the one-dimensional case ( axis) and assume&#10;that the resonator cavity is formed by an empty body bounded by an&#10;outcoupling fractionally transparent mirror at and a perfectly&#10;reflecting mirror at , and (negative) is the position of the emitter&#10;inside the cavity.&#10;&#10;In this case, the one-dimensional version of the Hamiltonian (\[1.1\])&#10;in the rotating-wave approximation reads with . Here, the (real)&#10;time-dependent function defines the (time-dependent) shape of the&#10;interaction of the emitter with the cavity field, which without loss of&#10;generality can be chosen to be normalized to unity. It may be used to&#10;simulate the (quasistatic) motion of the emitter through the cavity in&#10;the direction perpendicular to the cavity axis and/or motion along the&#10;cavity axis.&#10;&#10;In what follows we assume that the emitter is initially (at time )&#10;prepared in the state []{} and the rest of the system, i.e., the part of&#10;the system that consists of the electromagnetic field and the dielectric&#10;media (i.e., the cavity), is prepared in the ground state []{}. Since,&#10;in the case under consideration, we may approximately span the Hilbert&#10;space of the whole system by the single-excitation states, we may expand&#10;the state vector of the overall system at later times () as where is an&#10;excited single-quantum state of the combined field–cavity system.&#10;&#10;It is not difficult to prove that the Schrödinger equation for []{}&#10;leads to the following system of differential equations for the&#10;probability amplitudes , and : where is the area of the coupling mirror&#10;of the cavity, and is the detuning of the pump frequency from the&#10;transition frequency. The Green function determines the spectral&#10;response of the resonator cavity. For a sufficiently high- cavity, the&#10;excitation spectrum effectively turns into a quasi-discrete set of lines&#10;of mid-frequencies and widths , according to the poles of the Green&#10;function at the complex frequencies where the linewidths are much&#10;smaller than the line separations, In this case, assuming that the th&#10;mode of the cavity is quasi resonantly coupled to the transition with&#10;the transition frequency (cf. Fig. \[fig1\]), we substitute the formal&#10;solutions to Eqs. (\[1.19\]) and (\[1.18\]) \[with the initial condition&#10;, and \] into Eq. (\[1.20\]). Then, using the relations for the Green&#10;tensor as given by Eqs. (\[app:1\]) and (\[app:2\]), we can derive the&#10;integro-differential equation where the kernel function reads with and&#10;From Eq. (\[1.22\]) together with Eq. (\[1.24\]) we can conclude that&#10;can be regarded as vacuum Rabi frequency of emitter–cavity interaction.&#10;&#10;Following Ref. , it can be shown that when the Hilbert space of the&#10;system is effectively spanned by a single excitation, on a time-scale&#10;that is short compared to the inverse spontaneous emission rate of the&#10;emitter, the multimode Wigner function of the quantum state of the&#10;outgoing field can be derived to be (Appendix \[app2\]) where with and&#10;being the Wigner functions of the vacuum state and the one-photon Fock&#10;state, respectively, for the th nonmonochromatic mode. As we see, the&#10;mode labeled by the subscript , is basically prepared in a mixed state&#10;of a one-photon Fock state and the vacuum state, due to unavoidable&#10;existence of unwanted losses. The other nonmonochromatic modes of the&#10;outgoing field with are in the vacuum state and, therefore, remain&#10;unexcited.&#10;&#10;The Wigner function of the mode associated with the excited outgoing&#10;wave packet reveals that can be regarded as being the efficiency to&#10;prepare the excited outgoing wave packet in a one-photon Fock state&#10;(Appendix \[app2\]): with where indicates the position outside the&#10;cavity.

  <outline text="Efficiency of single-photon Fock state generation" _note="Inserting Eq. (\[1.30\]) into Eq. (\[1.29\]) and using Eq. (\[app:3\]),&#10;we find the efficiency of one-photon Fock state generation as where&#10;describes the wanted radiative losses due to transmission of the&#10;radiation through the fractionally transparent mirror. As we can see,&#10;the efficiency is proportional to the ratio , where the damping&#10;parameter can be regarded as being the sum , where describes the&#10;unwanted losses due to absorption. For the numerical calculations, we&#10;will assume , which corresponds to unwanted losses. Apart from the&#10;unavoidably existing unwanted losses, the one-photon Fock state&#10;efficiency depends on the shape and the Rabi frequency of the&#10;emitter–cavity interaction and the shape and the intensity of the&#10;external pump field. Finally, inserting Eq. (\[1.31\]) together with&#10;Eq. (\[1.30\]) into Eq. (\[1.35\]) and using Eq. (\[app:3\]), we find&#10;the spatiotemporal shape of the excited outgoing wave packet outside the&#10;cavity as (in the following, for the sake of simplicity, we assume )&#10;&#10;To present explicit results, we restrict ourselves to times much larger&#10;than the time the excited wave packet needs to almost completely exit&#10;the cavity. To find the spatiotemporal shape of the excited outgoing&#10;wave packet at time for given pump intensity and emitter–cavity&#10;interaction shapes and , respectively, we first solve Eq. (\[1.22\])&#10;together with Eqs. (\[1.24\]), (\[1.23\]) and the initial condition .&#10;Equation (\[1.22\]) is a Volterra-type integro-differential equation of&#10;the second kind, which can be solved using a standard fourth-order&#10;Runge-Kutta algorithm. Then, inserting the solution into Eqs. (\[2.5\])&#10;and (\[2.1\]) we can find, respectively, the efficiency of one-photon&#10;Fock state emission and the spatiotemporal shape of the wave packet&#10;leaving the cavity.&#10;&#10;In accordance with the vSTIRAP state-mapping proposal , in an ideal&#10;system the maximum one-photon Fock state efficiency can be achieved when&#10;the dynamics of the system follows the “dark state”, which is formed as&#10;a superposition of the states and . This is the case if the process is&#10;adiabatic and the emitter–cavity interaction is well-established before&#10;the driving pulse is applied. The case of the vSTIRAP is illustrated in&#10;Fig. \[fig2\], where a Gaussian-type emitter–cavity interaction shape&#10;and three driving pulse shapes are considered. Comparing the values of ,&#10;we see that for all three cases of the driving pulse shapes, which shows&#10;that the efficiencies of one-photon Fock state generation is only&#10;limited by the unwanted losses in the system. Moreover, Fig. \[fig2\]&#10;reveals that the excited outgoing wave packet carrying a single photon&#10;is generated in the time interval immediately as the driving pulse is&#10;applied. Thus, since the adiabatic evolution required by the vSTIRAP is&#10;much longer than the cavity mode decay time, the generated single-photon&#10;wave packet escapes from the cavity once it is generated, and, hence,&#10;the shape of the wave packet is effectively independent of the driving&#10;pulse shape.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Effects of emitter–cavity and emitter–pump interaction strengths and shapes" _note="In general, it is desirable to have the possibility to control and&#10;manipulate the shape of the outgoing wave packet and, at the same time,&#10;to excite it in a one-photon Fock state with high efficiency. Let us&#10;therefore study the dependencies of the efficiency and the wave packet&#10;shape on the emitter–cavity interaction and the emitter–pump interction&#10;in more detail. For the sake of transparency we first concentrate on the&#10;case, when the emitter–cavity interaction is constant, i.e., it does not&#10;vary with time.&#10;&#10;In Fig. \[fig3\] the spatiotemporal shape of the single-photon outgoing&#10;wave packet (solid lines) is shown for various intensities of a&#10;symmetric single-peak driving pulse. It is seen that when the value of&#10;the maximum of the driving pulse is low, , the shape of the outgoing&#10;wave packet (red, solid line in Fig. \[fig3\](b)) perfectly coincides&#10;with the shape of the driving pulse (red, dotted line in&#10;Fig. \[fig3\](a)). However, the efficiency of one-photon Fock state&#10;generation is quite low, . It is further seen that the efficiency&#10;increases with . On the other hand, the figure also reveals that with&#10;increasing the driving pulse induces the photon emission earlier, and as&#10;a result, the shape of the outgoing wave packet does not follow the&#10;profile of the driving pulse but features an asymmetric shape.&#10;&#10;Next, let us consider the dependence of the spatiotemporal shape of the&#10;single-photon outgoing wave packet on the Rabi frequency of the&#10;emitter–cavity interaction . In Fig. \[fig4\] the shape is plotted for&#10;various values of in the case of a symmetric single-peak driving pulse.&#10;For the vSTIRAP case is seen to be realized, resulting in&#10;high-efficiency single-photon Fock state generation and asymmetric&#10;spatiotemporal shape of the associated outgoing wave packet. For higher&#10;values of , the driving pulse is not strong enough to realize the&#10;vSTIRAP, and the efficiency of one-photon Fock state generation is&#10;reduced, but the spatiotemporal shape of the associated wave packet&#10;follows the shape of the driving pulse.&#10;&#10;An analogous situation can be observed for a double-peak driving pulse&#10;as illustrated in Fig. \[fig5\]. For emitter–cavity Rabi frequencies of&#10;the same order of magnitude as the driving pulse maximum, the vSTIRAP is&#10;again seen to be realized and the efficiency of one-photon Fock state&#10;generation is close to the maximum value of , but the shape of the&#10;associated wave packet becomes asymmetric. As expected, for higher rates&#10;of emitter–cavity Rabi frequency it follows the driving pulse shape but&#10;the one-photon Fock state generation efficiency is rather low.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Shape-controlled single-photon wave packet emission" _note="As we have seen, the shape of the single-photon outgoing wave packet can&#10;be changed by changing the emitter–cavity interaction and/or the driving&#10;pulse. In this context, a question of particular interest is the&#10;generation of single-photon wave packets of controlled shapes. To give&#10;an answer, let us assume that the desired spatiotemporal shape of the&#10;single-photon outgoing wave packet is given by a function at some time ,&#10;where the condition again ensures that the wave packet has almost&#10;completely left the cavity.&#10;&#10;From Eq. (\[2.1\]) \[ \] we find that Further, inserting Eq. (\[1.24\])&#10;into Eq. (\[1.22\]) we see that where is defined by and is related to&#10;the shape of the pump pulse according to Differentiation of&#10;Eq. (\[7.3\]) with respect to then yields the following differential&#10;equation for :&#10;&#10;Hence, the following scheme of shape controlling may be established. For&#10;a chosen (i.e., desired) spatiotemporal shape of the single-photon&#10;outgoing wave packet, the probability amplitude is calculated from&#10;Eq. (\[7.1\]). The result is then, together with Eq. (\[7.5\]), inserted&#10;into the differential equation (\[7.9\]). Its solution eventually yields&#10;the sought shape of the driving pulse.&#10;&#10;To illustrate the scheme, we apply it first to the generation of&#10;single-photon double-peak wave packets in the case, when the&#10;emitter–cavity interaction is constant, as shown in Fig. \[fig7\] for&#10;two one-photon Fock state generation efficiencies. In the case of low&#10;efficiency the shape of the single-photon outgoing wave packet is seen&#10;to closely follow the shape of the driving pulse. It is also seen that&#10;when an efficiency close to unity is required, then the second peak of&#10;the driving pulse must be higher than that of the first one. This can be&#10;explained by the fact that during the generation of a single-photon wave&#10;packet, a part of the wave packet (which corresponds to the first peak)&#10;already escapes the cavity. Therefore, to generate the second required&#10;peak the pump intensity should be higher.&#10;&#10;A similar behavior is observed in the case when a plateau-like&#10;spatiotemporal shape of the single-photon wave packet is desired. as it&#10;can be seen from Fig. \[fig8\]. Namely, in the case of constant&#10;emitter–cavity interaction, for low efficiencies the required profile of&#10;the driving pulse is similar to the spatiotemporal shape of the outgoing&#10;radiation. For generation efficiencies close to unity, the shape of the&#10;driving pulse needs to be asymmetric. For comparison, a case of&#10;time-dependent emitter–cavity interaction is shown in the inset of&#10;Fig. \[fig8\]. In particular, the interaction shape is chosen to&#10;simulate time-dependent variation of the location of the emitter in the&#10;cavity, as small oscillations of the interaction due to the variation of&#10;emitter position around the anti-nodes of the cavity mode. It is seen&#10;that to obtain the desired shape of the single-photon outgoing wave&#10;packet, the profile of the driving pulse should follow the variation of&#10;the emitter–cavity interaction.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Summary and concluding remarks" _note="Based on macroscopic QED in dispersing and absorbing media, we have&#10;presented an exact description of the resonant interaction of a&#10;three-level -type emitter in a high- cavity with the cavity-assisted&#10;electromagnetic field. In particular, we have studied the case when one&#10;transition of the emitter resonantly interacts with the cavity field and&#10;the other one is subjected to an external classical pump field. We have&#10;applied the theory to determine both the efficiency of one-photon Fock&#10;state generation and the spatiotemporal shape of the outgoing wave&#10;packet. In this context, we have shown that, even for high one-photon&#10;Fock state generation efficiencies, wave packets of arbitrary desired&#10;shape can be generated by appropriately adjusting the pump.&#10;&#10;Under the assumption that the Hilbert space of the total system is&#10;spanned by a single-quantum excitation, the quantum state of the excited&#10;outgoing nonmonochromatic mode is always a mixture of a one-photon Fock&#10;state and the vacuum state. Due to the unavoidable existence of unwanted&#10;losses, such as absorption or scattering, the efficiency of one-photon&#10;Fock state generation is always limited by the ratio of the cavity&#10;radiative decay rate to the total decay rate, which includes both wanted&#10;and unwanted losses.&#10;&#10;The spatiotemporal shape of the excited outgoing wave packet and the&#10;efficiency of one-photon Fock state generation depend on the interplay&#10;of various parameters of the emitter–cavity and emitter–pump&#10;interactions, such as their strengths and shapes. In particular, in the&#10;case of the vSTIRAP the efficiency of one-photon Fock state generation&#10;may be close to the upper limit determined by the unavoidable unwanted&#10;losses in the system. It requires that the process is adiabatic and the&#10;emitter–cavity interaction is well-established before the driving pulse&#10;is applied—so that the system dynamics follows the dark state. However,&#10;in this regime, control of the spatiotemporal shape of the excited&#10;outgoing wave packet is not possible, as the shape is nearly independent&#10;of the driving pulse shape.&#10;&#10;In the case when the emitter-cavity interaction can be regarded as being&#10;time independent on the timescales of the cavity decay time and the&#10;driving pulse length, two interaction regimes may be identified. In the&#10;regime when the emitter–cavity interaction Rabi frequency is&#10;sufficiently high compared to the (maximum) emitter–pump interaction&#10;Rabi frequency, the spatiotemporal shape of the excited outgoing wave&#10;packet follows the shape of the driving pulse. However, the one-photon&#10;Fock state generation efficiency is very low. This interaction regime&#10;has been realized by means of the interaction of a high-finesse cavity&#10;with both neutral atoms  and trapped ions , where single-photon wave&#10;packet shapes that follow the driving field shapes have been reported.&#10;In the regime when the emitter–pump interaction Rabi frequency is of the&#10;same order of magnitude as the emitter–cavity Rabi frequency, the&#10;one-photon Fock state generation efficiency is close to the upper limit.&#10;However, the spatiotemporal shape of the associated outgoing wave packet&#10;has a single-peak profile and is independent on the driving pulse&#10;profile. Desired shapes of outgoing wave packet with high efficiency of&#10;one-photon Fock state can be generated by appropriately adjusting the&#10;emitter–pump interaction for given emitter–cavity interaction. Since the&#10;spatiotemporal shape of the wave packet is robust against fluctuations&#10;of the pump pulse, the results found imply the feasibility to produce&#10;identical wave packets of desired shape carrying a one-photon Fock state&#10;each. As an illustration of the scheme, we have considered the&#10;generation of a single-photon double-peak wave packet. In fact, the&#10;one-photon Fock state is equally distributed among two&#10;time-(space-)separated single-peak wave packets, which is a realization&#10;of a time-bin entanglement that can be used to perform quantum key&#10;distribution . Importantly, the scheme also allows an optimization of&#10;the pump pulse profile to match with specific characteristics of the&#10;time dependence of the emitter–cavity interaction, such as injecting the&#10;emitter into the cavity or fluctuating emitter motion around the center&#10;of the interaction region.&#10;&#10;M. K. acknowledges valuable discussions with J. Wiersig.">
