<outline text="Introduction" _note="The main aim of this paper is to introduce Two Parameter Pochhammer&#10;Symbol, Two Parameter Gamma Function and Two Parameter Beta Function. p&#10;- k Gamma Function is the deformation of the classical Gamma Function,&#10;such that as and as .\&#10;In section 2, we defined Two Parameter Pochhammer Symbol denoted as ,&#10;with its convergent conditions. Two Parameter Pochhammer Symbol is the&#10;deformation of the classical Pochhammer Symbol, such that as and as Also&#10;we derived two parameter Pochhammer symbol in terms of the elementary&#10;symmetric function, and evaluate it’s derivative identities. It is most&#10;natural to relate the two parameter Pochhammer symbol to the two&#10;parameter Gamma Function is defined. We evaluate integral representation&#10;of two parameter Gamma Function, also represent two parameter Gamma&#10;Function into different infinite product forms and so many recurrence&#10;relations are evaluated.\&#10;In section 3, we defined two parameter Beta Function and two parameter&#10;Psi Function. Also evaluate some recurrence relations and functional&#10;relation with classical Beta Function.\&#10;Section 4, deal with the definition of Hypergeometric function with Two&#10;Parameter Pochhammer Symbol, known as p-k Hypergeometric function. Also&#10;we evaluate the Differential Equation, Functional relation with&#10;Classical Hypergeometric function and Integral Representation of p-k&#10;Hypergeometric function.\&#10;Throughout this paper Let be the sets of complex numbers, positive real&#10;numbers, real part of complex number, negative integer and natural&#10;numbers respectively.">
