<outline text="Introduction" _note="Uncertainty relation is one of the fundamental building blocks of&#10;quantum theory, and now plays an important role in quantum mechanics and&#10;quantum information . It is introduced by Heisenberg in understanding&#10;how precisely the simultaneous values of conjugate observables could be&#10;in microspace, i.e., the position and momentum of an electron. Kennard&#10;and Weyl proved the uncertainty relation where the standard deviation of&#10;an operator is defined by . Later, Robertson proposed the well-known&#10;formula of uncertainty relation which is applicable to arbitrary&#10;incompatible observables, and the commutator is defined by . The&#10;uncertainty relation was further strengthed by Schrödinger with the&#10;following form Here the commutator defined as .&#10;&#10;It is realized that the traditional uncertainty relations may not fully&#10;capture the concept of incompatible observables as the lower bound could&#10;be trivially zero while the variances are not. An important question in&#10;uncertainty relation is how to improve the lower bound and immune from&#10;triviality problem . Various attempts have been made to find stronger&#10;uncertainty relations. One typical kind of relation is that of Maccone&#10;and Pati, who derived two stronger uncertainty relations where , , and&#10;the sign on the right-hand side of the inequality takes while is&#10;positive (negative). The basic idea behind these two relations is adding&#10;additional terms to improve the lower bound. Along this line, more terms&#10;and weighted form of different terms have been put into the uncertainty&#10;relations. It is worth mentioning that state-independent uncertainty&#10;relations can immune from triviality problem . Recent experiments have&#10;also been performed to verify the various uncertainty relations .&#10;&#10;Besides the conjugate observables of position and momentum, multiple&#10;observables also exist, e.g., three component vectors of spin and&#10;angular momentum. Hence, it is important to find uncertainty relation&#10;for multiple incompatible observables. Recently, some three observables&#10;uncertainty relations were studied, such as Heisenberg uncertainty&#10;relation for three canonical observables , uncertainty relations for&#10;three angular momentum components , uncertainty relation for three&#10;arbitrary observables . Furthermore, some multiple observables&#10;uncertainty relations were proposed, which include multi-observable&#10;uncertainty relation in product and sum form of variances. It is worth&#10;noting that Chen and Fei derived an variance-based uncertainty relation&#10;for arbitrary incompatible observables, which is stronger than the one&#10;such as derived from the uncertainty inequality for two observables .&#10;&#10;In this paper, we investigate variance-based uncertainty relation for&#10;multiple incompatible observables. We present a new variance-based sum&#10;uncertainty relation for multiple incompatible observables, which is&#10;stronger than an uncertainty relation from summing over all the&#10;inequalities for pairs of observables . Furthermore, we compare the&#10;uncertainty relation with existing ones for a spin- and spin- particle,&#10;which shows our uncertainty relation can give a tighter bound than other&#10;ones.">

<outline text="Results" _note="For arbitrary observables , , , , the following variance-based&#10;uncertainty relation holds The bound becomes nontrivial as long as the&#10;state is not common eigenstate of all the observables.&#10;&#10;[**Proof:**]{} To derive (\[relation\]), start from the equality then&#10;using the inequality we obtain the uncertainty relation&#10;(\[relation\]).QED.&#10;&#10;To show that our relation (\[relation\]) has a stronger bound, we&#10;consider the result in Ref. , the relation (\[Maccone2p\]) is derived&#10;from the uncertainty equality Using the above uncertainty equality, one&#10;can obtain two inequalities for arbitrary observables, namely and The&#10;bound in (\[chen\]) is tighter than the one in (\[Maccone3p\]) .&#10;However, the lower bound in (\[chen\]) is not always tighter than the&#10;one in (\[Maccone3m\]) (see Figure \[f1\]).&#10;&#10;[**Example 1**]{} To give an overview that the relation (\[relation\])&#10;has a better lower bound than the relations&#10;(\[chen\]),(\[Maccone3p\]),(\[Maccone3m\]), we consider a family of&#10;qubit pure states given by the Bloch vector , and choose the Pauli&#10;matrices Then we have , , and . Similarly, , and . The comparison&#10;between the lower bounds (\[chen\]),(\[Maccone3p\]),(\[Maccone3m\]) and&#10;(\[relation\]) is given in Figure \[f1\]. Apparently, our bound is&#10;tighter than (\[chen\]) ,(\[Maccone3p\]) and (\[Maccone3m\]). We shall&#10;show with detailed proofs and examples that our uncertainty relation&#10;(\[relation\]) has better lower bound than that of&#10;(\[chen\]),(\[Maccone3p\]),(\[Maccone3m\]) in the following sections.">

Note that , the relation (\[Maccone3p\]) becomes&#10;Simplify the above inequality, we obtain which is equal to the relation&#10;(\[Maccone3p\]).&#10;&#10;Similarly, by using , our relation (\[relation\]) becomes Simplify the&#10;above inequality, we get which is equal to the relation (\[relation\]).&#10;It is easy to see that the right-hand side of (\[relations\]) is greater&#10;than the right-hand side of (\[patis\]).
