<outline text="Introduction" _note="Starting from 2004 (Butler et al. 2004, Santos et al. 2004), exoplanet&#10;search projects have been detecting planets of a few to 20 Earth masses&#10;at an ever-increasing rate, revealing them to be very frequent around&#10;solar-like stars (e.g. Howard et al. 2012) where they tend to form&#10;compact multiple systems (Rowe et al. 2014). Based on their mass (or&#10;minimal mass for planets detected by radial velocity - RV), these&#10;objects are loosely classified as super-Earths () and Neptunes (). This&#10;division is based on the theoretical limit for the runaway accretion of&#10;H/He by a protoplanet, (Rafikov 2006), and thus implicitly assumes that&#10;Neptunes are predominantly ice giants and that most super-Earths are&#10;massive terrestrial planets. However, the growing sample of transiting&#10;low-mass exoplanets with precise mass and radius measurements exhibit a&#10;wide diversity of densities that reveals a very heterogeneous&#10;population, making simplistic inferences hazardous when based on the&#10;comparison with solar system planets. A better understanding of this&#10;ubiquitous class of planets requires the thorough characterization of a&#10;significant sample, not only the precise measurements of their physical&#10;dimensions but also the exploration of their atmospheric composition to&#10;alleviate the strong degeneracies of composition models in this mass&#10;range (e.g. Seager et al. 2007, Valencia et al. 2013).&#10;&#10;Among the known transiting low-mass planets, GJ436b (Butler et al. 2004,&#10;Gillon et al. 2007) and GJ1214b (Charbonneau et al. 2009) are the most&#10;thoroughly characterized planets in the Neptune and super-Earth mass&#10;ranges, respectively, thanks to the small size ( 0.45 and 0.2 ) and&#10;proximity (about a dozen of pc) of their M-dwarf host stars. First&#10;constraints on their atmospheric properties have indeed been obtained by&#10;several programs (e.g. Kreidberg et al. 2014, Knutson et al. 2014a,&#10;Ehrenreich et al. 2015). Extending this kind of detailed studies to&#10;Neptunes and super-Earths orbiting solar-type hosts requires the&#10;detection of such planets in transit in front of extremely bright and&#10;nearby stars. A straightforward method to achieve this goal is to search&#10;for the transits of the low-mass planets detected by RV surveys. Indeed,&#10;these surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, and they have&#10;now detected enough short-period low-mass planets to make it highly&#10;probable that a handful of them transit their parent stars, as&#10;demonstrated by the previous detections by the MOST space telescope of&#10;the transits of the super-Earths 55Cnce (Winn et al. 2011)[^1]. Thanks&#10;to the brightness of their host stars, the atmospheric characterization&#10;of these two planets has already started (e.g. Demory et al. 2012,&#10;Knutson et al. 2014b). More recently, the same approach enabled us to&#10;reveal with [SPITZER]{} the transiting configuration of the rocky planet&#10;HD219134b (Motalebi et al. 2015) which, at 6.5pc, is the nearest known&#10;transiting exoplanet.&#10;&#10;Searching for the transits of RV low-mass planets is one of the main&#10;objectives of the future European space mission CHEOPS (Broeg et al.&#10;2013). However, CHEOPS is not due to launch before the end of 2017. To&#10;set it on its path, back in 2010 we set up an ambitious project using&#10;[SPITZER]{}/IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004) to search for the transits of the&#10;RV low-mass planets that have the highest geometric transit&#10;probabilities, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected&#10;by the HARPS spectrograph (Mayor et al. 2003). Our [SPITZER]{} transit&#10;search was composed of a cryogenic program targeting HD40307b (ID 495,&#10;27.5hr), and three so-called [WARM]{} (i.e. non cryogenic) programs (ID&#10;60027, 90072, and 11180; 100hr, 300hr, and 9.5hr) that targeted 24 other&#10;RV low-mass planets. Its published results have so far been the&#10;non-detection of the transits of HD40307b (Gillon et al. 2010, hereafter&#10;G10) and GJ3634b (Bonfils et al. 2011), the detection and confirmation&#10;of the transits of 55Cnce (Demory et al. 2011, Gillon et al. 2012a), the&#10;confirmation of the transiting nature of HD97658b (Van Grootel et al.&#10;2014), and the detection of a transit of HD219134b (Motalebi et al.&#10;2015). Results for another planet will be presented in a forthcoming&#10;paper (Ségransan et al., in prep.) We report here null results for the&#10;19 other targets of the project.&#10;&#10;We first present our targets and our determination of their transit&#10;ephemeris. In Sect. 3, we present our data and their reduction. Section&#10;4 describes our data analysis. Its main results are presented in Sect.&#10;5. Finally, we discuss our global results and give our conclusions in&#10;Sect. 6.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Our [SPITZER]{} program independently revealed the transiting&#10;    nature of 55Cnce (Demory et al. 2011). and HD97658b (Dragomir et al.&#10;    2013)">

<outline text="Targets and transit ephemeris determination" _note="Table 1 and Tables A.1 to A.4 list the 19 targets of this work. For each&#10;target, we performed an analysis of the available RVs, including new&#10;measurements for some of them gathered by HARPS[^1], to derive the most&#10;accurate transit ephemeris. This analysis was done with the adaptative&#10;Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm described in G10 (see also&#10;Gillon et al. 2012a, 2012b, 2014). Our nominal model was based on a star&#10;and one or several planets on Keplerian orbits around their common&#10;center of mass. For some cases, we added a linear or quadratic trend to&#10;the model, based on the minimization of the Bayesian information&#10;criterion (BIC, Schwarz 1974) to elect our final model. We checked that&#10;planet-planet interactions had negligible influence on our solutions,&#10;using, for this purpose, the [SYSTEMIC CONSOLE]{} software (Meschiari et&#10;al. 2009). We also used this software to perform an initial optimization&#10;of parameters to check that no solution existed with a higher likelihood&#10;than the published one. During this initial stage of the analysis, the&#10;RV errors were assumed to be measurement uncertainties. Once this&#10;initial stage was completed, we measured the quadrature difference&#10;between the rms of the residuals and the mean error, and this ”jitter&#10;noise” (Wright 2005) was quadratically summed to the measurement&#10;uncertainties. We then performed a MCMC analysis to probe the posterior&#10;probability distribution functions (PDF) of the model and physical&#10;parameters&#10;&#10;Each MCMC analysis was composed of five Markov chains of 10 steps, the&#10;first 20% of each being considered as its burn-in phase and discarded.&#10;For each run, the convergence of the five Markov chains was checked&#10;using the statistical test of Gelman &amp; Rubin (1992). The resulting&#10;posterior PDFs for the transit time and period were then used to&#10;schedule the [SPITZER]{} observations, with monitoring the transit&#10;window as the goal, i.e. keeping the probability to miss a transit below&#10;5%.&#10;&#10;Even if the resulting posterior PDFs for the orbital eccentricity of&#10;most target planets were compatible with zero, we did not assume a&#10;purely circular orbit for them to ensure the reliability of our derived&#10;transit ephemeris. Indeed, several examples of low-mass exoplanets with&#10;significantly eccentric few-days orbits (e.g. GJ436b, HAT-P-11b,&#10;HD215497b) remind us of the risks of systematically assuming circular&#10;orbits for close-in exoplanets based on tidal circularization arguments.&#10;An established theory for tidal dissipation mechanisms is still a&#10;long-term goal, and reaching it relies mostly on gathering new&#10;observational constraints.&#10;&#10;Once the [SPITZER]{} observations had been performed for a planet, we&#10;made a second MCMC analysis of the most up-to-date RV dataset, this time&#10;with the fitted transit time corresponding to the epoch covered by the&#10;[SPITZER]{} run. The purpose of this analysis was to derive the most&#10;accurate orbital parameters, transit ephemeris, and minimal masses for&#10;the planets under consideration. Indeed, for most of them HARPS gathered&#10;a significant number of RV measurements between the scheduling of the&#10;[SPITZER]{} observations and the final analysis of the [SPITZER]{}&#10;images.&#10;&#10;Tables A.1 to A.4 present the results obtained for each targeted planet&#10;from these MCMC analyses of the most up-to-date RV dataset. In addition&#10;to some basic parameters for the host stars, these tables give the&#10;origin of the RVs used as input in our MCMC analysis for each target,&#10;and provide the most relevant results of our MCMC analysis: the transit&#10;and occultation ephemeris, the minimal mass, the expected minimum&#10;transit depth corresponding to a pure iron planet (Seager et al. 2007),&#10;the equilibrium dayside temperature, the orbital parameters, and the&#10;expected duration for a central transit. The radius of the star was&#10;derived from the luminosity and effective temperature, taking bolometric&#10;corrections from Flower (1996).&#10;&#10;Tables A.1 to A.4 also present the median value and the 1- errors for&#10;the prior transit probability. It was computed at each step of the MCMC&#10;with the following formula: where is the stellar radius, is the orbital&#10;semi-major axis, is the orbital eccentricity and is the argument of&#10;periastron. This probability estimate does not take into account that&#10;planets are more likely to be discovered by RV if their orbit is&#10;significantly inclined (e.g. Wisniewski et al. 2012). By performing&#10;Bayesian simulations that assume different prior PDFs for the planetary&#10;masses, Stevens &amp; Gaudi (2013) have shown that this bias increases the&#10;transit probability of short-period low-mass RV planets like the ones&#10;considered here by only 20% in average. Furthermore, its actual&#10;estimation for a given planet depends strongly on the assumed prior PDFs&#10;for the planetary masses. We have thus neglected it in the context of&#10;this work.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Most HARPS measurements used in this work are available on the&#10;    ESO/HARPS online archive at&#10;    http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/eso/repro/form">

<outline text="&lt;span&gt;WARM SPITZER&lt;/span&gt; photometry" _note="Tables A.5 to A.11 provide a summary of the [SPITZER]{} observations.&#10;Since all our targets are very bright ( between 2.96 and 6.90), all of&#10;them were observed in subarray mode (32x32 pixels windowing of the&#10;detector), the extremely fast Fowler sampling (0.01s), which maximizes&#10;the duty cycle and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). No dithering pattern was&#10;applied to the telescope (continuous staring). For each target, the&#10;exposure time was selected to maximize the S/N while staying in the&#10;linear regime of the detector, basing on the [WARM SPITZER]{} flux&#10;density estimator tool[^1] and on the instructions of the [WARM&#10;SPITZER]{} Observer Manual[^2].&#10;&#10;The observations of program 60027 (Cycle 6) and 90072 (Cycle 9) were&#10;performed between 2009 Dec 14 and 2010 Sep 11, and between 2012 Dec 03&#10;and 2014 May 14, respectively. For several of the Cycle 9 targets, we&#10;benefitted from the newly introduced PCRS peak-up mode (Ingalls et al.&#10;2012). This mode provides enhanced accuracy in the position of the&#10;target on the detector, to a significant decrease of the so-called&#10;‘pixel phase effect’ that is the most important source of correlated&#10;noise in high-S/N staring mode observation with IRAC InSb arrays (e.g.&#10;Knutson et al. 2008). For HD1461b, we supplemented our data with the&#10;IRAC 4.5m observations presented by Kammer et al. (2014), as described&#10;in Sect. 5.2.&#10;&#10;On a practical level, each observation run was divided in one or several&#10;science astronomical observational requests (AOR) of 12hr at most,&#10;preceded by a short (20-30 min) AOR to allow the pointing of the&#10;telescope and the instrument to stabilize. The IDs of all AORs are given&#10;for each target in Tables A.5 to A.11. These tables also give the&#10;version of the [SPITZER]{} pipeline used to calibrate the corresponding&#10;images, the resulting files being called basic calibrated data (BCD) in&#10;the [SPITZER]{} nomenclature. Each subarray mode BCD is composed of a&#10;cube of 64 subarray images of 3232 pixels (pixel scale = 1.2 arc&#10;second).&#10;&#10;The following reduction strategy was used for all the [SPITZER]{} AOR.&#10;We first converted fluxes from the [SPITZER]{} units of specific&#10;intensity (MJy/sr) to photon counts, then aperture photometry was&#10;performed on each subarray image with the [IRAF/DAOPHOT]{}[^3] software&#10;(Stetson, 1987). For each AOR, we tested different aperture radii and&#10;background annuli, and selected the combination minimizing the white and&#10;red noises in the residuals of a short data fitting analysis. The center&#10;and width of the point-spread functions (PSF) were measured by fitting a&#10;2D-Gaussian profile on each image. The distribution of the measurements&#10;was then studied, and measurements that had a visually discrepant&#10;position relative to the bulk of the data were then discarded. For each&#10;block of 64 subarray images, we then discarded the discrepant values for&#10;the measurements of flux, background, - and -positions using a 10-&#10;median clipping for the four parameters, and the resulting values were&#10;averaged, the photometric errors being taken as the errors on the&#10;average flux measurements. Finally, a 50- slipping median clipping was&#10;used on the resulting light curves to discard outliers (owing to, for&#10;example, cosmic hits).&#10;&#10;[^1]: http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/warmmission/propkit/pet/starpet&#10;&#10;[^2]: http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/warmmission/propkit/som&#10;&#10;[^3]: IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory,&#10;    which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in&#10;    Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National&#10;    Science Foundation.">

<outline text="Global &lt;span&gt;WARM SPITZER&lt;/span&gt; + RV data analysis" _note="We analyzed the [SPITZER]{} photometric time-series supplemented by the&#10;RVs with our MCMC code. For each target, our model for the RVs was the&#10;same as the one presented in Sect. 2. The assumed photometric model&#10;consisted of the eclipse model of Mandel &amp; Agol (2002) to represent the&#10;possible eclipses of the probed planets, multiplied for each light curve&#10;by a baseline model that aimed to represent the other astrophysical and&#10;instrumental effects at the source of photometric variations. We assumed&#10;a quadratic limb-darkening law for the stars. For each light curve that&#10;corresponded to a specific AOR, we based the selection of the baseline&#10;model on the minimization of the BIC. Tables A.5 to A.11 present the&#10;baseline function elected for each AOR.&#10;&#10;Following Gillon et al. (2014), the instrumental models included three&#10;types of low-order polynomials. The first one had as variables the - and&#10;-positions of the center of the PSF to represent the so-called pixel&#10;phase effect of the IRAC InSb arrays (e.g. Knutson et al. 2008). The&#10;second one had the PSF widths in the - and/or the -direction as&#10;variables, its inclusion in the baseline model strongly increasing the&#10;quality of the fit for all AORs (the so-called PSF breathing effect, see&#10;also Lanotte et al. 2014). The third function was a polynomial of the&#10;logarithm of time to represent a sharp increase of the detector response&#10;at the start of some AORs (the so-called ramp effect, Knutson et al.&#10;2008). To improve the quality of the modeling of the pixel phase effect,&#10;especially the fitting of its highest frequency components,for most AORs&#10;we supplemented the - and -polynomial with the bi-linearly-interpolated&#10;sub-pixel sensitivity (BLISS) mapping method (Stevenson et al. 2012).&#10;The sampling of the position space was selected so that at least five&#10;measurements fall within the same sub-pixel. See Gillon et al. (2014)&#10;for more details.&#10;&#10;The jump parameters of the MCMC, i.e. the parameters randomly perturbed&#10;at each step of the Markov Chains, were as follows:&#10;&#10;The stellar mass , radius , effective temperature , and metallicity&#10;\[Fe/H\]. For these four parameters, normal prior PDFs were assumed&#10;based on the values given in Tables A.1-4.&#10;&#10;For the potential transiting planet, the parameter , where is the&#10;orbital semi-major axis and is the orbital inclination. would correspond&#10;to the transit impact parameter in the case of a circular orbit. The&#10;step was rejected if . For the other planets of the system, was fixed to&#10;0.&#10;&#10;The parameter for all planets of the system, being the RV orbital&#10;semi-amplitude, the orbital eccentricity, and the orbital period.&#10;&#10;The orbital period of each planet.&#10;&#10;For each planet, the two parameters and , being the orbital eccentricity&#10;and being the argument of periastron.&#10;&#10;The planet/star area ratio for the potential transiting planet. At each&#10;step of the MCMC, the planetary radius corresponding to a pure iron&#10;composition was computed under the formalism given by Seager et al.&#10;(2007), and if the planetary radius derived from and was smaller, the&#10;step was rejected. A similar rejection was done for , an implausibly&#10;large size for the low-mass planets considered here. The goal of these&#10;prior constraints on was to avoid fitting extremely shallow transits and&#10;ultra-grazing transits of unrealistically big planets in the correlated&#10;noise of the light curves to ensure an unbiased posterior transit&#10;probability. For the other planets of the multiple systems, was fixed to&#10;0. In all cases, we checked that a transit of another planet of these&#10;systems was not expected to occur during the [SPITZER]{} observations.&#10;&#10;The time of inferior conjunction for all planets of the system. For the&#10;potential transiting planets that we considered, corresponds&#10;approximatively to the mid-time of the transit searched for by&#10;[SPITZER]{}.&#10;&#10;The limb-darkening of the star was modeled by a quadratic law (Claret&#10;2000). For both [WARM SPITZER]{} bandpasses (3.6 and 4.5 m), values for&#10;the two quadratic limb-darkening coefficients and were drawn at each&#10;step of the MCMC from normal distributions whose expectations and&#10;standard deviations were drawn from the tables of Claret &amp; Bloemen&#10;(2011) for the corresponding bandpasses and for the stellar atmospheric&#10;parameters given in Tables A.1-4.&#10;&#10;Five chains of 100000 steps were performed for each analysis, their&#10;convergences being checked using the statistical test of Gelman and&#10;Rubin (1992). They followed a preliminary chain of 100000 steps, which&#10;was performed to estimate the need to rescale the photometric errors.&#10;For each light curve, the standard deviation of the residuals was then&#10;compared to the mean photometric errors, and the resulting ratios were&#10;stored. represents the under- or overestimation of the white noise of&#10;each measurement. On its side, the red noise present in the light curve&#10;(i.e. the inability of our model to represent perfectly the data) was&#10;taken into account as described in G10, i.e. a scaling factor was&#10;determined from the standard deviations of the binned and unbinned&#10;residuals for different binning intervals ranging from 5 to 120 minutes,&#10;the largest values being kept as . At the end, the error bars were&#10;multiplied by the correction factor . The derived values for and are&#10;given for each light curves in Tables A.5-11.">

  <outline text="BD-061339" _note="BD-061339 (a.k.a. GJ221) is a V=9.7 late-K dwarf around which two&#10;planets were detected by HARPS (Lo Curto et al. 2013), a super-Earth on&#10;a 3.9d orbit and a planet of minimal mass on a 126d orbit. Our model&#10;selection process for the RVs (HARPS + PFS) favored a model with a slope&#10;in addition to these two planets (Table A.1) . The derived value for&#10;this slope is [ ]{}per year, which could correspond to a giant planet in&#10;outer orbit or to the imprint of a stellar magnetic cycle.&#10;&#10;As can be seen in Fig. 1, the high-precision of the [SPITZER]{}&#10;photometry (42 ppm per 30 min time bin) discards any transit for&#10;BD-061339b during our observations, even for an unrealistic pure iron&#10;composition.

  <outline text="HD1461" _note="HD1461 is a V=6.5 solar-type star known to host a super-Earth on a 5.77d&#10;orbit (Rivera et al. 2010). Recently, a second super-Earth on a 13.5d&#10;orbit was announced by Díaz et al. (2015). In our analysis of the HARPS&#10;+ Keck RVs for this star, the convergence of the MCMC appeared to be&#10;significantly improved by removing the 20 first Keck measurements for&#10;which the exposure time and the resulting precision were significantly&#10;lower than for the rest of the data. Our analysis favored a three planet&#10;model (5.77, 13.5, and 377 days period) in addition to a second-order&#10;time polynomial, suggesting the presence of a fourth low-frequency&#10;signal, and an activity model consisting of a sum of second-order&#10;polynomials in the cross-correlation function (CCF, Baranne et al. 1996,&#10;Queloz et al. 2001) parameters (Table A.1): width, contrast, and&#10;bisector. We inferred that the 377d period, close to the duration of a&#10;year, is caused by a systematic effect (the stitching) recently revealed&#10;to affect HARPS data (Dumusque et al. 2015). The data used by Díaz et&#10;al. (2015) were corrected for this effect. We made several tests that&#10;showed that the inclusion or not of this 377d Doppler signal in the RV&#10;model did not affect the results for the closest-in planet, including&#10;its transit ephemeris, so we kept it in our final analysis.&#10;&#10;A search for a transit of HD1461b with [SPITZER]{} was presented by&#10;Kammer et al. in 2014 (program 80220). We first reduced their data and&#10;used them with the HARPS+Keck RVs as input for a global MCMC analysis.&#10;The resulting posterior full transit probability was 0.5%, suggesting&#10;that a small but significant fraction of the transit window was not&#10;covered by these [SPITZER]{} observations. As can be seen in Fig. 2, a&#10;transit that had ended just before the [SPITZER]{} observations remained&#10;possible. This possibility is amplified by the ramp effect that affected&#10;the first hour of the [SPITZER]{} data, resulting in an increase of&#10;brightness that could be degenerated with a transit egress. We thus&#10;complemented these [SPITZER]{} archive data with new [SPITZER]{}&#10;observations covering the first part of the transit window. We performed&#10;a global analysis of all [SPITZER]{} + RVs that made a transiting&#10;configuration for HD1461b very unlikely (see Fig. 2), the resulting&#10;posterior full transit probability now being of only 0.14% (Table 1).&#10;&#10;\[fig:2\]">

  <outline text="HD10180" _note="HD10180 is a V=7.3 solar-type star hosting a particularly interesting&#10;system of six planets of relatively low-masses (Lovis et al. 2011). At&#10;first, we did not consider searching for the transit of the 1.18d-period&#10;Earth-mass planet candidate HD10180b presented by Lovis et al. (2011)&#10;because its Doppler detection was not firmly secured when we planned our&#10;[SPITZER]{} Cycle 6 observations of the star. Furthermore, we estimated&#10;that its transit would, in any case, be too shallow (a few dozens of&#10;ppm, at most 100 ppm) to be firmly detected with [SPITZER]{}. We thus&#10;focused on the planet HD10180c (, = 5.76 d), for which the Doppler&#10;signal was clearly detected in the HARPS data, and for which the&#10;expected transit depth ( ppm) was large enough to ensure a sure&#10;detection with [SPITZER]{}. enabled us to discard a transit of the&#10;planet (Fig. 3), the resulting posterior full transit probability being&#10;of 0.14% (Table 1). Still, we noticed a shallow structure in the&#10;detrended photometry that occurs at a time consistent with a transit of&#10;HD10180b (Fig. 4), the best-fit transit depth of 90 ppm translating into&#10;a radius of 1.2 consistent with a planetary mass of . Based on this&#10;result, we decided to observe in our Cycle 9 program 90072 two more&#10;transit windows of HD10180b, this time at 4.5 m. No transit structure&#10;was clearly detected in the resulting light curves (Fig. 4, bottom), and&#10;a short MCMC analysis of the data led us to conclude that these new data&#10;do not increase the significance of the 2010 tentative detection. We&#10;thus conclude that the low-amplitude structure in our Cycle 6&#10;[SPITZER]{} light curve is probably just correlated noise of&#10;instrumental origin that is not perfectly represented by our baseline&#10;model and that can easily be modeled by a shallow enough transit&#10;profile. For [SPITZER]{}, the average amplitude of these correlated&#10;noise structures is of a few dozen of ppm (see Sec. 6), making the firm&#10;detection of a unique transit shallower than 100ppm impossible -&#10;similarly to the one expected for HD10180b (see discussion in Sec. 6 and&#10;our estimated detection thresholds in Table 1). This so-called red noise&#10;limit can be surpassed, but only by gathering more observations of the&#10;transit window, as we did here (see also the case of HD40307b in Gillon&#10;et al. 2010).&#10;&#10;\[fig:3\]&#10;&#10;\[fig:4\]">

The false-alarm probability (FAP) derived by&#10;[SYSTEMIC]{} for this short-period planet candidate was close to 1%.&#10;Based on this small FAP and the scientific importance of this putative&#10;planet if transiting, we decided to monitor two of its transit windows&#10;with [SPITZER]{}. Unfortunately, the resulting light curves did not show&#10;any convincing transit-like structure (Fig. 5). Our [SPITZER]{} data&#10;were not acquired during a transit window of the planet at 14.2 d, thus&#10;keeping its transiting nature unconstrained.&#10;&#10;In 2014, we analyzed the updated HARPS dataset. This analysis confirmed&#10;the existence of the low-frequency signal of magnetic cycle origins,&#10;still well-modeled by a quadratic trend, but it led to a much lower&#10;significance (FAP 10%) for the 1.091 d signal. A stronger signal at&#10;18.98 d and at its alias period of 1.056 d emerged with FAP close to 1%.&#10;Still, including a polynomial function of the CCF parameters (bisector,&#10;contrast, width) in our MCMC modeling, these signals vanished from the&#10;residuals, indicating that their origin is stellar (activity), not&#10;planetary. The period 18.98 d could then be interpreted as the rotation&#10;period of the star, resulting in an equatorial rotation speed 2.2 km.s&#10;which is consistent with the measured of 2 km.s (Glebocki &amp; Gnacinski&#10;2005). This stellar signal, combined with aliasing effects, would thus&#10;be responsible for creating spurious signals with periods slightly&#10;larger than 1 d.&#10;&#10;\[fig:5\]">

We used [SPITZER]{} to observe a transit window of&#10;HD115617 in March 2010.&#10;&#10;With , HD115617 is an extremely bright star for [SPITZER]{}. At 4.5 m,&#10;it is nevertheless faint enough to be unsaturated for the shortest&#10;available integration time (0.01s). However, the [SPITZER]{} Science&#10;Center (SSC) informed us that the requested long observation of HD15617&#10;could not be performed at 4.5 m for technical reasons. At 3.6 m, the&#10;star has a flux density of mJy while the saturation limit is 20000 mJy&#10;for an integration time of 0.01s. SSC informed us the observations could&#10;still be performed without any risk of saturation if the star was placed&#10;at the corner of four pixels, leading to an effective flux density that&#10;was low enough to avoid saturation. We decided to test this strategy.&#10;Unfortunately, the light curve corrected for known systematic effects is&#10;corrupted by a clear variability at the level of a few tens of percent&#10;(Fig. 15, top). A Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Press et al. 1992) of the&#10;corrected photometry reveals a power excess at 0.11 days (Fig 15,&#10;bottom). We could not identify the origin of this variability.&#10;Nevertheless, an astrophysical origin is very unlikely, since HD115617&#10;is known to be an old inactive star (Vogt et al. 2010). This variability&#10;probably originates from the near-saturation of the detector. Indeed,&#10;the center of the stellar image was not located at the corner of four&#10;pixels as intended. The instrumental effect at work has a typical&#10;timescale similar to the signal we are trying to detect, and its&#10;amplitude is much larger than the one of the searched transit. Even&#10;worse, it seems highly variable in nature and we could not find any&#10;analytical function of external parameters (PSF peak value, center&#10;position and width, background, etc.) able to represent it&#10;satisfactorily. Without a thorough understanding of the effect, we&#10;concluded that searching for a transit of a few hundreds of ppm with&#10;such data was illusory.

<outline text="Discussion and conclusion" _note="The constraint brought by the [SPITZER]{} photometry on the transiting&#10;nature of a given planet can be directly estimated in Table 1 by&#10;comparing the derived prior and posterior transit probabilities. For 16&#10;out of the 19 RV planets targeted here, our [SPITZER]{} observations&#10;explored the transit window with a coverage and precision high enough to&#10;make a transiting configuration very unlikely, the posterior transit&#10;probabilities for these 16 targets all being less than 0.55% (Table 1).&#10;For HD45184b, this posterior transit probability is still of 1.3%,&#10;because our [SPITZER]{} observations did not explore the second part of&#10;its transit window (see Sect. 5.9 and Fig. 10). The transiting nature of&#10;HD13808b and HD115617b is left unexplored by our observations.&#10;&#10;For the radius of each planet, our MCMC analysis assumed a uniform prior&#10;PDF ranging from a pure-iron composition radius to 11 . The fact that a&#10;transiting configuration was disfavored by our MCMC analysis for all&#10;targeted planets does not preclude the possibility that one or several&#10;transits were in the data, but were just too shallow to be noticed by&#10;the Markov Chains. To estimate the actual detection threshold of our&#10;observations, we performed the following procedure for each of our&#10;targets. We created 50 fake transit light curves based on the&#10;multiplication of the actual light curve by a transit model of the&#10;targeted RV planets, each transit assuming a circular orbit for the&#10;planet, a mid-transit time drawn from the prior transit timing PDF,&#10;which was derived from the RV analysis, and an impact parameter drawn&#10;from a uniform PDF that ranged from 0 to 0.9. For each transit model,&#10;the depth was automatically tuned to have a difference in BIC of +9.2&#10;between models neglecting and taking into account the transit. This&#10;difference in BIC corresponds to a Bayes factor of , indicating a&#10;decisive selection of the transit model (Jeffreys 1961), i.e. a firm&#10;detection (at better than 3-3.5 sigma) of the transit. We then averaged&#10;the transit depths (and planet’s radii) derived for the 50 light curves&#10;and adopted the resulting value as the detection threshold for the&#10;considered dataset. These detection thresholds are given in Table 1,&#10;expressed as transit depth (in ppm) and planetary radius. For each&#10;planet, they are compared to the planet’s radius assuming pure-iron and&#10;Earth-like compositions. The detection threshold radius is smaller than&#10;the ones assuming pure-iron and Earth-like compositions for,&#10;respectively, 5 and 14 of the 17 planets for which the transiting nature&#10;was constrained by our observations. For 12 and 3 planets, we cannot&#10;thus fully reject the absence of a transit in our data, provided very&#10;metal-rich and Earth-like compositions, respectively. However, no&#10;transiting configuration is even midly favored for any planet by our&#10;MCMC analysis (from the comparison of the last columns of Table 1), so,&#10;considering the excellent photometric precision of our [SPITZER]{} data,&#10;the hypothesis of a missed transit is clearly unlikely. Using the&#10;posterior transit probabilities shown in Table 1, the formula indeed&#10;results in a posterior probability that none of the probed 19 planets&#10;transits of 83%, vs 22% for the corresponding prior probability ().&#10;&#10;Our multi-Cycle [SPITZER]{} transit search explored the transiting&#10;nature of 25 RV planets. It detected one or several transits for the&#10;planets HD75732e (aka 55Cnce) (Demory et al. 2011, Gillon et al. 2012)&#10;and HD219234b (Motalebi et al 2015), confirmed the transiting nature of&#10;HD97658b (Van Grootel et al. 2015), discarded or disfavored the&#10;transiting nature of 20 planets (including one presented in Ségransan et&#10;al., in prep.), and left the one of two planets unconstrained. By&#10;discovering the transits of two planets of a few Earth-masses that are&#10;suitable for detailed atmospheric characterization, it brought a&#10;significant contribution to the study of super-Earths. Statistically&#10;speaking, its final result is normal: considering all the planets listed&#10;in Table 1 except HD97658b, which we decided to observe only because we&#10;knew that it was probably transiting (Dragomir et al. 2013), the sum of&#10;the geometric transit probabilities amounts to 196%, i.e. the project&#10;was expected to observe the transits of planets.&#10;&#10;The photometric performances demonstrated by [SPITZER]{} in this program&#10;are illustrated in Fig. 21. This figure compares as a function of the&#10;targets’ -magnitude the standard deviations measured in the detrended&#10;light curves for a sampling of 30 min to the corresponding formal errors&#10;computed following the instructions of the [SPITZER]{} Observation&#10;Manual (SOM[^1]). At 4.5m, the measured standard deviations are well&#10;modeled by the linear relationship ppm, while the mean quadratic&#10;difference between the measured standard deviations and the formal&#10;errors is ppm. This quadratic difference is ppm at 3.6 m, and ppm when&#10;neglecting HD125612, which seems to be a more active star than our other&#10;targets (Sec. 5.15). These quadratic differences can be attributed to&#10;the low-frequency noise of instrumental and astrophysical origins that&#10;cannot be represented by our instrumental model. Figure 21 shows that&#10;this red noise dominates the photometric precision of [SPITZER]{},&#10;especially for the brighter targets. Its values are low enough – a few&#10;dozens of ppm – to qualify the photometric precision of [SPITZER]{} as&#10;excellent, and to make it an optimal facility for the search for very&#10;low-amplitude transits on bright nearby stars.&#10;&#10;The [SPITZER]{} mission should come to an end in early 2019.&#10;Fortunately, the CHEOPS space mission (Broeg et al. 2015) will arrive&#10;just in time to take over the search for the transits of super-Earths&#10;discovered by RVs around nearby stars. CHEOPS will not benefit from a&#10;targets’ visibility as favorable as [SPITZER]{}, but its full dedication&#10;to transit observations will more than compensate for its geocentric&#10;orbit.&#10;&#10;\[fig:21\]&#10;&#10;\[tab:rvsmallplanets\]&#10;&#10;[cccccccccccc]{} Planet &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; Detection &amp; Pure-Fe &amp; Earth-like &amp;&#10;Prior &amp; Posterior\&#10;&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; threshold &amp; radius &amp; radius &amp; &amp; \&#10;&amp; \[\] &amp; \[pc\] &amp; &amp; \[\] &amp; ppm/\[\] &amp; \[\] &amp; \[\] &amp; \[%\] &amp; \[%\]\&#10;HD40307b &amp; 0.78 &amp; 12.8 &amp; 4.79 &amp; 4.3 &amp; 150/0.91 &amp; 1.13 &amp; 1.44 &amp; 6.6 &amp;&#10;0.19\&#10;GJ3634b &amp; 0.45 &amp; 19.8 &amp; 7.47 &amp; 7.0 &amp; 500/1.05 &amp; 1.31 &amp; 1.65 &amp; 7.0 &amp;&#10;0.50\&#10;HD75732e &amp; 0.91 &amp; 12.3 &amp; 4.02 &amp; 7.8 &amp; NA &amp; 1.34 &amp; 1.70 &amp; 28.9 &amp; 100\&#10;HD97658b &amp; 0.77 &amp; 21.1 &amp; 5.73 &amp; 7.6 &amp; NA &amp; 1.33 &amp; 1.69 &amp; 4.3 &amp; 100\&#10;HD219134b &amp; 0.78 &amp; 6.5 &amp; 5.57 &amp; 4.3 &amp; NA &amp; 1.15 &amp; 1.44 &amp; 9.5 &amp; 100\&#10;BD-061339b &amp; 0.63 &amp; 20.3 &amp; 6.31 &amp; 6.9 &amp; 235/1.15 &amp; 1.30 &amp; 1.64 &amp; 7.7 &amp;&#10;0.53\&#10;HD1461b &amp; 1.04 &amp; 23.2 &amp; 4.90 &amp; 6.7 &amp; 170/1.56 &amp; 1.29 &amp; 1.63 &amp; 8.1 &amp;&#10;0.14\&#10;HD10180c &amp; 1.06 &amp; 39.0 &amp; 5.87 &amp; 13.1 &amp; 180/1.73 &amp; 1.53 &amp; 1.95 &amp; 8.4 &amp;&#10;0.14\&#10;HD13808b &amp; 0.77 &amp; 28.6 &amp; 6.78 &amp; 11.8 &amp; NA &amp; 1.50 &amp; 1.90 &amp; 3.5 &amp; 3.5\&#10;HD20003b &amp; 0.91 &amp; 43.8 &amp; 6.65 &amp; 11.8 &amp; 280/1.79 &amp; 1.49 &amp; 1.90 &amp; 3.4 &amp;&#10;0.54\&#10;HD20781b &amp; 0.83 &amp; 35.4 &amp; 6.55 &amp; 2.1 &amp; 220/1.39 &amp; 0.93 &amp; 1.17 &amp; 7.1 &amp;&#10;0.15\&#10;HD31527b &amp; 0.96 &amp; 38.6 &amp; 6.05 &amp; 10.7 &amp; 190/1.64 &amp; 1.46 &amp; 1.85 &amp; 4.4 &amp;&#10;0.46\&#10;HD39194b &amp; 0.72 &amp; 25.9 &amp; 6.09 &amp; 4.1 &amp; 210/1.22 &amp; 1.12 &amp; 1.42 &amp; 6.4 &amp;&#10;0.46\&#10;HD45184b &amp; 1.00 &amp; 21.9 &amp; 4.87 &amp; 12.1 &amp; 150/1.39 &amp; 1.50 &amp; 1.91 &amp; 7.7 &amp;&#10;1.29\&#10;HD47186b &amp; 1.03 &amp; 39.6 &amp; 6.01 &amp; 23.2 &amp; 175/1.59 &amp; 1.77 &amp; 2.26 &amp; 10.5 &amp;&#10;0.00\&#10;HD51608b &amp; 0.86 &amp; 34.8 &amp; 6.33 &amp; 13.1 &amp; 195/1.39 &amp; 1.54 &amp; 1.95 &amp; 4.0 &amp;&#10;0.11\&#10;HD93385d &amp; 1.04 &amp; 42.2 &amp; 6.07 &amp; 4.0 &amp; 200/1.78 &amp; 1.11 &amp; 1.41 &amp; 7.9 &amp;&#10;0.23\&#10;HD96700b &amp; 0.96 &amp; 25.7 &amp; 5.00 &amp; 9.1 &amp; 155/1.58 &amp; 1.40 &amp; 1.77 &amp; 6.8 &amp;&#10;0.09\&#10;HD115617b&amp; 0.94 &amp; 8.6 &amp; 2.96 &amp; 6.2 &amp; NA &amp; 1.26 &amp; 1.60 &amp; 9.4 &amp; 9.4\&#10;HD125612c &amp; 1.09 &amp; 54.2 &amp; 6.84 &amp; 19.3 &amp; 290/1.92 &amp; 1.69 &amp; 2.16 &amp; 9.7 &amp;&#10;0.24\&#10;HD134060b &amp; 1.07 &amp; 24.2 &amp; 4.84 &amp; 10.0 &amp; 165/1.61 &amp; 1.43 &amp; 1.82 &amp; 8.4 &amp;&#10;0.00\&#10;HD181433b &amp; 0.86 &amp; 26.8 &amp; 6.09 &amp; 7.5 &amp; 190/1.26 &amp; 1.33 &amp; 1.68 &amp; 4.9 &amp;&#10;0.52\&#10;HD215497b &amp; 0.87 &amp; 43.6 &amp; 6.78 &amp; 6.1 &amp; 250/1.66 &amp; 1.26 &amp; 1.59 &amp; 11.8 &amp;&#10;0.31\&#10;HD219828b &amp; 1.18 &amp; 72.3 &amp; 6.53 &amp; 20.2 &amp; 155/2.18 &amp; 1.71 &amp; 2.19 &amp; 14.2 &amp;&#10;0.00\&#10;&#10;This work is based in part on observations made with the [SPITZER SPACE&#10;TELESCOPE]{}, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,&#10;California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.
