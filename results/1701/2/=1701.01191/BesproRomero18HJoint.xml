    <title> Heavy quarks within the electroweak multiplet</title>
    <abstract>Standard-model fields and their associated electroweak Lagrangian are
equivalently expressed in a shared spin basis. The scalar-vector terms
are written with scalar-operator components acting on quark-doublet
elements, and shown to be parametrization-invariant. Such terms, and the
t- and b-quark Yukawa terms are linked by the identification of the
common mass-generating Higgs operating upon the other fields, after
acquiring a vacuum expectation value . Thus, the customary vector masses
are related to the fermions’, fixing the t-quark mass with the relation
either for maximal hierarchy, or given the b-quark mass , implying GeV,
for GeV. A sum rule is derived for all quark masses that generalizes
this restriction. An interpretation follows that electroweak bosons and
heavy quarks belong in a multiplet. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The standard model (SM) describes elementary-particle features and their&#10;interactions, which is praiseworthy, given its relatively limited&#10;required input, consisting of specific gauge and flavor symmetries,&#10;representations, and parameters, yet aspects remain within the model&#10;whose origin and connection to other tenets is absent, and that need to&#10;be addressed.&#10;&#10;Thus, among its successes, the SM predicts mass values for the W and Z&#10;bosons that carry the short-range electroweak interaction, in terms of&#10;electroweak parameters, through the Higgs mechanism. However, one&#10;salient SM problem is that the fermion sector and its masses remain&#10;arbitrary, as they arise from Lagrangian terms, independent from the&#10;boson elements.&#10;&#10;The electroweak sector hints it may provide this link, given that the W&#10;and Z vectors have universal couplings to SM fermions, and the Higgs&#10;field collectively gives mass to fermions and bosons. In addition, the&#10;similar order of magnitude of the measured masses of the W, Z, the&#10;recently discovered scalar excitation, associated with the Higgs, and&#10;the top quark (with the bottom quark’s the next highest), suggests&#10;connections among them, and thus, a common energy scale. Furthermore,&#10;fermions occupy the spin-1/2 and fundamental representations of the&#10;Lorentz and scalar groups, respectively, as vector bosons belong to the&#10;adjoint representation of each group,[^1][^2] which implies bosons can&#10;be constructed in terms of fermions, suggesting composite structures&#10;and/or a common origin. The above motivates looking for a formalism that&#10;takes account of discrete degrees of freedom in a single basis,&#10;including group representation properties, such as the fermion-boson&#10;fundamental-adjoint duality for the Lorentz-scalar representations, and&#10;that describes the combined action of operators on fields.&#10;&#10;A previously proposed SM extension, based on a shared extended spin&#10;space, with a matrix formalism, satisfies these requirements, as it&#10;replicates SM fields with their features, and matrix multiplication&#10;accounts for operator action on fields. This space contains a&#10;(3+1)-dimensional \[d\] subspace and one beyond 3+1, linked,&#10;respectively, to Lorentz and scalar degrees of freedom. At each&#10;dimension, a finite number of Lorentz-invariant partitions are generated&#10;with specific symmetries and representations, reproducing particular SM&#10;features, where the cases with dimension 5+1, 7+1, and 9+1 were studied.&#10;&#10;In this connection, it is worth recalling that a basis or representation&#10;choice can be useful, even essential, in the description of a system and&#10;its dynamics. It may reveal otherwise-hidden connections between its&#10;components, and provide a simpler framework to understand physical&#10;properties. Such a basis may describe effective degrees of freedom&#10;accounting for collective interactions, allowing for a simpler near&#10;free-particle description, in a first approximation. For example,&#10;nucleon and associated boson interactive configurations give a tractable&#10;account of nuclear-motion modes. Within condensed matter and&#10;low-temperature superconducting systems, a residual attractive&#10;interaction related to phonons couple electrons into Cooper pairs, which&#10;propagate freely, and lead to frictionless currents. In an application&#10;of this theory to quantum field theory and elementary particles, a&#10;four-fermion interaction produces fermion and composite-boson masses,&#10;linking their values. The quark model conceives mesons and baryons in&#10;terms of constituent (dressed) quarks.&#10;&#10;Leaving aside the more speculative nature of the spin SM extension, but&#10;complementarily to it, in this paper, we use it as a basis to derive SM&#10;connections, and the fields’ mass values in particular: SM heavy-fermion&#10;(), vector (), and scalar () fields are equivalently expressed in terms&#10;of the obtained common basis for both Lorentz and electroweak degrees of&#10;freedom, in turn, recasting their Lagrangian components ; the&#10;identification of the scalar operator within the and vertices links&#10;univocally its defining (mass) parameters. Indeed, such universal&#10;electroweakly-invariant terms lead, under the Higgs mechanism, to a&#10;scalar whose lowest-energy condensate state pervades space, and&#10;generates particle masses through its vacuum expectation value . Within&#10;the spin basis, this mechanism is similarly represented; as these fields&#10;shape elements on a matrix space, with a single associated scalar&#10;operator acting upon the others, their mass-generation property relates&#10;their coefficients.&#10;&#10;Next, as we give the paper’s organization, we sketch the argument in&#10;more detail. Section 2 reviews the applied spin-extended space for&#10;symmetry generators and states. The paper focuses then on the (7+1)-d&#10;case that can describe the electroweak sector, and a quark doublet. For&#10;all sectors, , , , the conventional and spin-space Lagrangian are&#10;equivalent, which is shown term-by-term in Appendices 1,2. Section 3&#10;chooses one among two vector bases within , where vectors with chiral&#10;properties are adequate. Section 4 writes equivalently with combinations&#10;of the scalars and their conjugates, with universal couplings to&#10;vectors, shown explicitly in Appendix 2; similarly for the spin-base&#10;representation, in which these two scalars induce a projection to&#10;flavor-doublet components (as t,b quarks). Schematically, given the&#10;spin-space basis element for a field , we write in terms of containing&#10;these two scalar components, obtaining the vector mass squared within as&#10;. In Section 5, we show that the fermion masses within can be written ,&#10;where contains two terms with appropriate Yukawa coefficients. Within&#10;the spin-basis formalism, we derive that , have the same operator&#10;structure; given their mass-giving nature, the identification of these&#10;operators and their coefficients translates a -normalization restriction&#10;on to , implying a relation for the t and b quark masses. Section 6&#10;shows a procedure exists that generalizes consistently this relation to&#10;all quarks in terms of a sum rule for their masses, taking advantage of&#10;the chiral projection properties of the scalar field in the spin basis.&#10;In Section 7, we draw conclusions. We work in the classical framework&#10;afforded by the Lagrangian, and at tree-level, but also rely on a&#10;quantum-mechanical interpretation.&#10;&#10;[^1]: As the Higgs occupies the SU(2) fundamental representation.&#10;&#10;[^2]: For the Abelian hypercharge group U(1), gauge invariance ensures&#10;    boson-fermion quantum-number additivity.">

The coefficient matching in&#10;derives from the underlying freedom of choice in , and, in turn, from&#10;the underlying three-parameter - symmetry that can be equally&#10;implemented in the spin basis. Looking at the matrix structure, the&#10;operator within makes it a rank-2 reducible-representation operator, as&#10;expressed in Eq. \[HiggsComponentsYm1\] and can be read in Eq.&#10;\[LSVHiggschi\]; indeed, connects two fermion spin polarizations, but&#10;hits a single W state’s components twice as duplicates the scalar&#10;representations, requiring the normalization factor. In yet another&#10;interpretation, this relation is obtained from the normalization&#10;restriction in the Yukawa term in Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumExpRR\], dividing&#10;out the energy scale set by the vacuum expectation. To the extent that&#10;these arguments rely on a common metric vector space, they are&#10;geometric.&#10;&#10;Equation \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\] assumes the parity-conserving condition,&#10;constraining the quark masses.[^1] For maximal hierarchy, with ,&#10;dependence on [ONE ]{} comparable large scale O(O(), (,) we get , for&#10;GeV, ; alternatively, the quark-b mass input predicts the top quark-mass&#10;as GeV, for GeV (while renormalization effects give GeV.) These two&#10;calculations are consistent with the measured top pole mass GeV, where&#10;systematic and statistic errors are quoted, respectively. Future&#10;precision improvements will test the limits of this tree-level&#10;calculation, with view of the bottom-quark influence.&#10;&#10;[^1]: We neglect t-b mixing as the CKM matrix is nearly diagonal,&#10;    confirming this method can be applied here.">

<outline text="Extended quark-mass relation" _note="We place the heavy-quark mass relation in Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\] in&#10;the larger SM context, and argue for a plausible generalization for all&#10;quarks, based on it. For these purposes, we first derive some SM field&#10;properties using the spin basis, assuming they can be also derived&#10;within the conventional SM basis, given their equivalent application.&#10;Needless to say, we demand consistency with the SM, and with experiment.&#10;At the Section’s end we identify some underlaying general assumptions.&#10;&#10;Thus, we concentrate on the SM three-generation subset of the (7+1)-d&#10;model, as can be effected by the Yukawa operators in Eq. \[YukawaOp\].&#10;Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\] uses that the same single-scalar operator acts&#10;on the fermions and the vector bosons: such an operator is reproduced in&#10;the and terms, as the term admits a basis expression that applies the&#10;associated -symmetries in Section 4. This connection implies the&#10;equivalent expression that can be read from the Appendices, which shows&#10;separation of quark u- and d-type components, depending on scalars, and&#10;no mixing among them. We focus on the mass-generating scalar elements&#10;corresponding to the neutral , , from Eqs. \[DefHtHb\],&#10;\[HiggsComponentsYm1\], and their hermitian conjugates. As mass&#10;relations are considered, we assume fields after the Higgs mechanism is&#10;applied.&#10;&#10;In particular, a connection emerges between the normalized bilinear&#10;Higgs term that gives masses to the vector bosons, as the Z mass in Eq.&#10;\[ZmassEqEx\], and the fermions. where is defined in Eq. \[HmVacuum\], ,&#10;, , , are quarks at rest, defined in Table \[tab:tableqbquarks\], , are&#10;, coefficients, as given in Eq. \[HiggsComponentsYm1\], in the second&#10;equality we use the trace property, and the third expresses the&#10;normalization condition. Factor 2 comes as only one spin fermion&#10;component is used. Thus, elements can be written as a sum of inner&#10;products between Yukawa and SM scalar components. This relation derives&#10;from the projective nature of Higgs normal and dual terms, accompanied&#10;by a fermion chirality operator in , in Eq. \[DefHtHb\]. Eq.&#10;\[YukawaSVWithWithoutf\] can also be understood from the substitutions&#10;in with terms extracted from in Eq. \[BilinHiggsFer\], using the trace&#10;permutation property. The identity in each substitution provides the&#10;link to the t, b Yukawa constants for the doublet, singlet cases. The&#10;arguments leading to the mass relation in Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\]&#10;imply , , as given in Eq. \[YukawaParameters\], namely, a diagonal mass&#10;basis is assumed.&#10;&#10;Since one can pick any fermion generation on Tables&#10;\[tab:masslesslefthanded\], \[tab:masslessrighthanded\], the&#10;interpretation of the , coefficients as Yukawa constants within the term&#10;leads to a generalization to other families and non-diagonal Yukawa&#10;elements. We now consider the extension of in Eqs. \[BilinHiggsFer\] and&#10;\[BilinHiggsFerCorrex\] with a fermion expansion that uses all Yukawa&#10;coefficients, where the Yukawa operators from Eq. \[YukawaOp\] are&#10;necessary to connect the u- and d-type quark fields defined in Eq.&#10;\[quarkfields\], and , are Yukawa coefficients, with the up, down, charm&#10;and strange quarks, also included, relabelling singlets , and doublets .&#10;&#10;The allowed Yukawa terms, diagonal and mixed, can be included using all&#10;combinations of a 3-generation set of normalized fermions on Table&#10;\[tab:masslesslefthanded\], where a projection operator as in Eq.&#10;\[ProjeFla\] is applied. We evaluate the trace of bilinear , terms with&#10;components, extending Eq. \[YukawaSVWithWithoutf\], producing which may&#10;be also obtained by the substitution of the associated scalar&#10;coefficients in bilinear neutral Higgs terms The correspondence of in&#10;Eqs. \[BilinHiggsFer\] and \[BilinHiggsFerCorrex\] to in Eq.&#10;\[BilinHiggsGenYuka\] induces the sum of square mass-matrix elements in&#10;Eq. \[TransfoHHp\], which is equal (given the property , a matrix, its&#10;diagonal form) to the sum over the square masses, A generalization with&#10;such a sum is induced, similar to relation Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\],&#10;with the Higgs normalization condition, Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumExpRR\].&#10;Since Eq. \[TransfoHHp\] maintains the same structure as Eq.&#10;\[YukawaSVWithWithoutf\], following the generalization of to ,&#10;Implicitly, we used the -fermion symmetry, namely, no fermion&#10;preference. With today’s uncertainties in the quark-mass values, this&#10;relation is phenomenologically consistent with Eq.&#10;\[HiggsNormVacuumEx\], as the same maximal hierarchy or quark b-mass&#10;input argument follows, and the rest of the quarks have comparably&#10;negligible masses. As this relation is independent of the mass&#10;diagonalization matrix, it is also of the CKM matrix.&#10;&#10;The two quark-mass conditions in Eqs. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\] and&#10;\[MassSumRule\] are interpreted. This paper shows SM features support a&#10;boson and fermion connection leading to the t,b quark mass condition in&#10;Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\]. If only such quarks belong in the same class&#10;as the other massive SM bosons, a different mass-generating mechanism is&#10;expected for the other fermions; one concludes that they are not&#10;affected by such dynamics, as their masses are comparably negligible. On&#10;the other hand, if there is a common dynamics, as suggested by the&#10;similar fermion-boson inner product, the all-quark condition Eq.&#10;\[MassSumRule\] applies, given the fermion symmetry, and the structure&#10;similarity between Eq. \[YukawaSVWithWithoutf\] and Eq. \[TransfoHHp\].&#10;&#10;Initial fermion states within the 3-generation set for in Eq.&#10;\[BilinHiggsGenYuka\] remain within such a subspace, given the commuting&#10;property of the projection operator in Eq. \[ProjeFla\] with&#10;baryon-number, Lorentz, gauge and mass operators (, , , , .) In other&#10;words, within the 3-generation subset of states, the substitution in is&#10;valid. This implies that no operator will connect the initial fermions&#10;outside the 3 generations. So is the case for the 3-generation extension&#10;of in Eq. \[BilinNoTracElectroweak\], requiring a sum over the&#10;(electroweak) flavors. We conclude the 3-generation spin-basis&#10;projection consistently describes the SM.&#10;&#10;By construction, Eqs. \[TransfoHFerBa\], \[TransfoHFer\] imply masses&#10;represent O() corrections. This is also the order of the Hamiltonian&#10;needed to obtain the other fermion masses. More assumptions are&#10;necessary to get further information on masses, and CKM matrix elements.&#10;For example, hierarchy arguments on the masses’ order of magnitude&#10;difference were derived that explain how the associated W,Z,t,b, large&#10;scale mostly cancels for the other fermions at the vertical level&#10;(within a doublet) and horizontal level (between families). This leads&#10;to a consistent description in which such mechanisms coexist with the&#10;Higgs-generated one. While we produce above further consistency&#10;arguments for their parameters, more stringent constraints from the&#10;(7+1)-d will be tested elsewhere. Other arguments leading to hierarchy&#10;exist as textures.&#10;&#10;We conclude Yukawa coefficients, contained in rest fermions as a device,&#10;connect to bilinear scalar combinations containing mass-generating Higgs&#10;terms in , keeping the Lorentz or gauge structure of unmodified, and&#10;ultimately consistently with the SM. We show above in Eq.&#10;\[BilinHiggsGenYuka\] induces a generalized sum rule for the square&#10;quark masses in Eq. \[MassSumRule\]. The latter is a plausible extension&#10;of Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\], based on a subset of terms, after the&#10;Higgs mechanism. The same type of argument can be made for leptons, but&#10;given their smaller masses, their influence will be lesser, while&#10;similar conditions as in Eq. \[YukawaSVWithWithoutf\] will also lead to&#10;PNRS matrix independence.">

<outline text="Conclusions and Outlook" _note="In summary, the formalism used places fields on a basis that&#10;simultaneously contains SM bosons and fermions. and terms are linked&#10;through the mass rendering of the scalar operator within them, using the&#10;electroweak vertex independence of its components acting on different&#10;fermion-doublet elements, implicitly expected, but which we now expose.&#10;Supporting a SM prediction of a unique scalar, input from the normalized&#10;scalar-vector vertex, and the mass-parameter interpretation in the&#10;vertex, relates and , cf Eq. \[HiggsNormVacuumEx\], the main result in&#10;the paper. The same relation can be argued by considering the scalar&#10;operator’s matrix rank, or assuming normalized Yukawa components. Based&#10;on chiral properties, the same Higgs-operator rule, and a correspondence&#10;between fermion-boson inner products and Yukawa terms, a plausible&#10;extended sum rule for the fermion square masses is proposed, given in&#10;Eq. \[MassSumRule\]. Both relations are consistent with the SM, given&#10;today’s particle-mass uncertainties. We conclude the spin basis is a&#10;useful platform to obtain, within the SM, the quark-mass electroweak&#10;relations.&#10;&#10;The central argument input can be also read when terms in , attached&#10;with the projector in Eq. \[projeRL\], are carried into the intermediate&#10;chiral version in Eq. \[LSVHiggschi\] and, after the 1/2 factor&#10;cancellation in its mass component, relate to terms in the Yukawa . The&#10;spin-basis gives it further support as it classifies discrete degrees&#10;and produces SM features. Thus, the matrix space restricts&#10;representations, in turn, exhausting the space; electroweak fields&#10;belong to the adjoint, and , fields to the fundamental representations.&#10;Additionally, the chiral property in the electroweak term, associated to&#10;, translates naturally to the interaction components. Normalized fields&#10;define the Lagrangian terms, setting the trace coefficient, and the&#10;stage for the , comparison. In the spin-basis context, the field’s&#10;chiral property is nominal, but consistent, as contains the projector&#10;from , and within , acts on chiral fermion components.&#10;&#10;The scalar operator acting on vectors and fermions links their matrix&#10;elements, connecting parameters. The particles’ simultaneous&#10;participation in mass generation through the Higgs mechanism and related&#10;SM vertices, with assigned representations, implies a description with&#10;common dynamics, and at a given energy scale, already at the classical&#10;level, and suggests fields belong in a multiplet, supporting a&#10;common-origin unification assumption.&#10;&#10;It follows that the arguments provide a geometric approach to address&#10;problems as the electroweak-symmetry breaking origin. The formalism&#10;facilitates the fields’ composite description, as boson degrees of&#10;freedom may be written in terms of two fermions’. Expansions in such&#10;fields may be useful, independently of whether compositeness is physical&#10;or only a device.&#10;&#10;Naturalness is hinted at in the , associated single scale, which&#10;produces a hierarchy effect. Thus, while this symmetry-breaking effect&#10;applies for heavy-quark masses, it could be valid also horizontally&#10;between generations in accordance with the fermions’ low masses. While&#10;here we considered the top-quark mass, the other fermions, besides the&#10;b-quark, may be included in this scheme, namely, considering bilinear&#10;fermion components for scalar particles, but they will have little&#10;influence on this result, as their interaction is proportional to their&#10;masses.&#10;&#10;As the spin basis connects the vector and quark sectors, constraints may&#10;be derived for SM extensions as supersymmetry, composite models that&#10;require dynamical symmetry breaking as technicolor or, in an extension&#10;of such models, top and bottom quarks that conform condensate-producing&#10;massive particles.&#10;&#10;Besides the fields’ spin representation connecting the scalar operator&#10;in two vertices, it highlights chiral components of particles and&#10;interactions that maintain their SM equivalence. Indeed, we showed two&#10;such valid chiral and non-chiral scalar bases for the Lagrangian. This&#10;freedom could be clarified in other vertices, as with a SM extension&#10;with additional scalar degrees of freedom, whereas in this paper, we&#10;considered only their SM projection.&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;S.

<outline text="Appendix 1: Fermion-vector  fermion-scalar  Lagrangians" _note="In this Appendix we show the Lagrangians’ equivalence in the&#10;conventional and spin bases by considering explicit expressions with&#10;accompanying wave functions (or fields). With hindsight, we use the same&#10;Lagrangian label in both bases.&#10;&#10;First, we use an iterative procedure\[16\] to obtain a (7+1)-d&#10;representation. Starting with the Pauli matrices , and , we get the -d&#10;representation&#10;&#10;then, the -d representation&#10;&#10;and finally, the -d representation&#10;&#10;The commuting property of the Lorentz and scalar symmetry operators&#10;implies that they can be represented as a tensor product. To compare&#10;with the spin-space basis, we write the conventional-basis generators as&#10;tensor products, choosing the (7+1)-d space to represent them; thus the&#10;spin-1/2 and SU(2) terms, expressed by the Clifford basis, and Pauli&#10;matrices, respectively, generalize to, e.g., and , with the 3-Pauli&#10;matrix, and corresponding spin and weak isospin unit operators , ,&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;Similarly, states in the conventional basis can be obtained that are&#10;represented in (7+1)-d space. For example, a left-handed (L), spin-1/2&#10;polarization (1), top (T), state satisfies    .&#10;&#10;Eq. 36 in the paper implies spinors are labeled by the spin operator in&#10;the Dirac representation , and the weak SU(L) component. While most of&#10;the results in the paper are representation-independent, a unitary&#10;transformation may be applied to the (7+1)-d matrices to show the&#10;conventional-basis description used in Eq. 36 in the paper. Indeed, has&#10;a Dirac form with the unitary transformation with (actually, it&#10;exchanges and .) and is represented, after the unitary transformation ,&#10;by&#10;&#10; Next, we write all the conventional-basis states in this basis, and&#10;their association to the spin-extended basis states, with corresponding&#10;quantum numbers (notation used in Table 4 and Ref. 7, written&#10;inbetween):&#10;&#10; where the spin-basis states are shown [IN EXTENSO]{} in Tables 2 and 3.&#10;&#10;For the fermion wave functions , we use polar coordinates, where the&#10;conventional and spin terms contain, respectively, for quarks , with&#10;spin components , and chirality . The magnitude part can be shown to be&#10;the same for both cases, as can be derived by comparing, e. g., the mass&#10;term. The vectors , are real fields.&#10;&#10;The phases appear in each term in both bases. For example, for the&#10;conventional basis and for the two polarizations within the left-handed&#10;hypercharge SU(2)-doublet, we use the association with applied to&#10;transform back from the Dirac representation, and we used the terms in&#10;Eqs.
