    <title>Long-Period Intensity Pulsations in Coronal Loops Explained by Thermal
Non-Equilibrium Cycles</title>
    <abstract>In solar coronal loops, thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) is a phenomenon
that can occur when the heating is both highly-stratified and
quasi-constant. Unambiguous observational identification of TNE would
thus permit to strongly constrain heating scenarios. Up to now, while
TNE is the standard interpretation of coronal rain, the long-term
periodic evolution predicted by simulations has never been observed yet.
However, the detection of long-period intensity pulsations (periods of
several hours) has been recently reported with SoHO/EIT, and this
phenomenon appears to be very common in loops. Moreover, the three
intensity-pulsation events that we recently studied with SDO/AIA show
strong evidence for TNE in warm loops. In the present paper, a realistic
loop geometry from LFFF extrapolations is used as input to 1D
hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations show that for the present loop
geometry, the heating has to be asymmetrical to produce TNE. We analyse
in detail one particular simulation that reproduces the average thermal
behavior of one of the pulsating loop bundle observed with AIA. We
compare the properties of this simulation with the properties deduced
from the observations. The magnetic topology of the LFFF extrapolations
points to the presence of sites of preferred reconnection at one
footpoint, supporting the presence of asymmetric heating. In addition,
we can reproduce the temporal large-scale intensity properties of the
pulsating loops. This simulation further strengthens the interpretation
of the observed pulsations as signatures of TNE. This thus gives
important information on the heating localization and time scale for
these loops. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Numerical simulations show that with a highly-stratified (i.e. mainly&#10;concentrated near the footpoints) and quasi-constant heating, a&#10;phenomenon called thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) can govern the dynamics&#10;of coronal loops. This particular localisation and time scale of the&#10;heating results in a particular response of the plasma: evaporation and&#10;condensation cycles with periodic evolution of the temperature and the&#10;density . The plasma heated near the footpoints evaporates and starts to&#10;fill the loop. The temperature increases, followed by the density with a&#10;time delay. As the loop becomes denser, the heating per mass unit&#10;decreases and thus the temperature decreases. The temperature drop&#10;increases the radiation losses . The radiation losses start to overcome&#10;the heating locally in the corona as the temperature continues to&#10;decline, producing thermal runaway. Eventually, it produces plasma&#10;condensations that fall toward the loop legs because of gravity, before&#10;the cycle repeats. The heating stratification produces an unstable loop&#10;where no thermal equilibrium is possible . The term TNE was introduced&#10;by to describe both the unstable and cyclical aspect of the system.&#10;While the thermal runaway occuring LOCALLY in the corona and on a short&#10;time scale (compared to the loop evolution time scale) has all the&#10;characteristics of a thermal instability , we use the term TNE in the&#10;present paper since we focus on the GLOBAL behavior of the system. In&#10;the remainder of the paper, we thus use the term TNE since the cyclical&#10;aspect of the phenomenon is central to our argument.&#10;&#10;In simulations, a state of TNE can be produced with different time&#10;scales of the heating, as long as the time delay between two heating&#10;events is short compared to the typical cooling time. TNE can be&#10;obtained either with impulsive heating with a sufficiently high&#10;repetition rate , or with a strictly steady heating .&#10;&#10;The role of TNE in the formation and evolution of prominences and&#10;coronal rain is both predicted by simulations and confirmed by&#10;observations . In contrast, the relevance of TNE to the description of&#10;warm loops (temperatures about 1 MK) has been questioned . However,&#10;recent simulations show that it should not be ruled out because&#10;discrepancies with observations may arise from an oversimplification of&#10;the loop geometry used in models, especially in 1D simulations.&#10;&#10; reported on the detection of long-period intensity pulsations (periods&#10;of several hours) with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on&#10;board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory . This phenomenon appears&#10;to be very common in active regions and in particular in loops. The&#10;authors estimate that about half the active regions of the year 2000&#10;underwent this kind of pulsation.&#10;&#10;These pulsations are new observational signatures of heating processes&#10;in loops. Three of these intensity pulsation events have been analyzed&#10;in detail in using simultaneously the six coronal passbands of the&#10;Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY .&#10;We used both the Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis&#10;diagnostics developed by and the time lag analysis of to conclude that&#10;these loops show evidence for TNE. This conclusion is reinforced by the&#10;pulse-train nature of the observed signals . Moreover, have recently&#10;confirmed the statistical significance of the detections.&#10;&#10;The time lag analysis presented in shows that there is no time delay in&#10;the loop intensity between the 171 Å and 131 Å AIA channels. That&#10;implies that the plasma does not cool in average below the temperature&#10;of the peak response of the 171 channel, i.e. about 0.8 MK . This&#10;specific plasma response seems to match the evaporation and incomplete&#10;condensation cycles seen in the simulations of . The authors present&#10;several loops modeled with a 1D hydrodynamic code, using different loop&#10;symmetries, loop cross-sections, and heating intensity and geometry&#10;profiles. Some of their simulations lead to a TNE state of&#10;incomplete condensations. This term is opposed to complete condensations&#10;which are characteristic of catastrophic cooling events where the&#10;temperature, locally in the corona, drops down to chromospheric&#10;temperatures. The authors investigate the effect of loop geometry&#10;(particularly loop cross-sectional area) on the characteristics of loops&#10;and conclude on the importance of using realistic loop geometries in&#10;numerical models. In addition, the geometry and the strength of the&#10;heating seem to play an important role in producing the different&#10;regimes of evaporation and condensation cycles.&#10;&#10;We focus our present analysis on the main event (the one with the&#10;largest excess power in Fourier spectra) studied in . We use a 1D&#10;hydrodynamic simulation code in order to study if the scenario of cycles&#10;of evaporation and incomplete condensations are consistent with our&#10;observations. In Section \[sec:simu\], we present the results of one&#10;loop simulation that best reproduces the periods and the average thermal&#10;behavior derived from the DEM and the time lag analysis presented in .&#10;This simulation uses a non ad hoc loop geometry from linear force-free&#10;field (LFFF) extrapolations. We then test in Section \[sec:obs\] if the&#10;characteristics of both the heating function chosen and the synthetic&#10;intensities from the simulation match the observations of the active&#10;region. Finally, we discuss our results and their implications for&#10;coronal heating in Section \[sec:discussion\] and&#10;Section \[sec:summary\].">

In&#10;this active region, we detected intensity pulsations with a period of&#10;9.0 hr in large coronal loops. The aim of this section is to reproduce&#10;the main characteristics (long term variations and average behavior of&#10;the loop bundle observed with AIA) of the plasma response of this&#10;pulsating event, as detailed in .

  <outline text="Magnetic field extrapolation" _note="We extrapolate the magnetic field of NOAA AR 11499 from the photosphere&#10;to coronal altitudes using a LFFF model with the method described in and&#10;. Most of the loops in the region studied are located in a plage region,&#10;with relatively weak and small-scale fields, so vector magnetograms are&#10;probably not reliable enough to use directly with a non-linear&#10;force-free field (NLFFF) model, as discussed in . Moreover, this active&#10;region does not show a sigmoidal shape, so that the differences between&#10;magnetic field extrapolations LFFF or NLFFF ought to be relatively&#10;small.&#10;&#10;We use magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board&#10;SDO. The HMI data (hmi.M\_720s series) are read with the routine&#10;`read_sdo` from the Interactive Data Language SolarSoftware library. We&#10;choose the HMI magnetogram closest to the middle date of the AIA&#10;sequence, i.e. June 06, 2012 23:12 UT, close to the central meridian. As&#10;the magnetograms do not show large structural differences during the&#10;whole sequence, the use of one particular magnetogram for the analysis&#10;ought to be sufficiently accurate. In addition, since the date chosen is&#10;close to the passage of the active region at the central meridian, it&#10;allows us to minimize distortion effects and thus to compare the&#10;extrapolated field lines with the detected contour of excess Fourier&#10;power. The magnetogram and the background coaligned AIA image at&#10;171 Å (see Figure \[fig:carte\_extrapol\]) are pixels binned to increase&#10;the signal-to-noise ratio. The field-of-view (FOV) for the geometrical&#10;study is an area of  Mm. This FOV is centered on 20.5 of Stonyhurst&#10;heliographic latitude and -2 of Stonyhurst heliographic longitude. The&#10;calculation is made in Cartesian coordinates.&#10;&#10;Placed at , the magnetogram defines the bottom of the extrapolation box,&#10;which is tangent to the photosphere at the center of the FOV. The&#10;magnetogram is padded with zeroes at each side of the two horizontal&#10;directions to minimize aliasing. The total size of the bottom of the box&#10;is then  Mm. There are periodic boundary conditions on the four sides of&#10;the domain. We use a uniform grid with points for the Fast Fourier&#10;Transform (FFT). The field lines are extrapolated up to an altitude of&#10;300 Mm. For the purpose of the analysis, the resulting magnetic field&#10;was stored on a nonuniform grid centered on the main active region of&#10;the field of view with 350 points in the direction using intervals as&#10;small as 0.3 Mm near . The force-free parameter, , is chosen to visually&#10;fit the visible loops in the whole FOV. By an iterative method, we chose&#10;Mm.&#10;&#10;Some extrapolated lines are presented in Figure \[fig:carte\_extrapol\],&#10;including those colored in red that correspond to the pulsating loop&#10;bundle. The red lines are selected with the criterion that at least 20%&#10;of the line length should be enclosed by the contour of detected&#10;pulsations. We use the detected contour of pulsations at 335 Å, the&#10;channel with the strongest Fourier signal , while the background image&#10;is at 171 Å because the loops are more discernable in this passband.&#10;&#10;The correspondence between the red lines and the contour of detected&#10;pulsations is better for the eastern footpoints than the western&#10;footpoints. However, since the contour of detected pulsations was&#10;constructed using three days of data after remapping in heliographic&#10;coordinates , we should bear in mind that geometric distortions are&#10;significant.">

The heating term&#10;is imposed VIA a function constant in time.&#10;&#10;The parallel thermal conductivity is chosen to follow the classical&#10;Spitzer conductivity value. The radiative loss function is derived from&#10;the CHIANTI atomic database (version 7.1) with coronal abundances . We&#10;assume that the plasma is totally ionized, only composed of protons and&#10;electrons and that the temperature of protons and electrons are equal:&#10;and .&#10;&#10;Even though an option to artificially broaden the transition region at&#10;low temperatures is typically used in this code, as described by and ,&#10;we do not employ this technique in the present study. Since we analyze&#10;only a single loop, we can afford to use a very high resolution mesh to&#10;resolve the very steep gradients in the transition region, and run the&#10;code for a long time. Therefore, we keep the true Spitzer thermal&#10;conductivity and radiative loss law without modification. Future studies&#10;involving parameter scans over many loop solutions will likely require&#10;the artificial broadening of the transition region.&#10;&#10;The initial condition is defined by a state of hydrostatic equilibrium&#10;with a parabolic temperature profile along the loop (2 MK at the&#10;mid-point of the loop) and a cool ( MK) chromospheric reservoir at the&#10;footpoints. In this initial state, the chromosphere thickness is 3.5 Mm&#10;at each footpoint, which evolves for given the loop geometry and the&#10;heating function chosen. and are the boundary conditions at and , with&#10; m.&#10;&#10;The simulated loop uses the geometry of the magnetic field line&#10;indicated by the white arrow in Figure \[fig:carte\_extrapol\]. This&#10;field line is in the domain of loops with EUV intensity pulsations and&#10;has a length  Mm. The geometry of this line is shown in&#10;Figure \[fig:geometry\_loop\_simu\]. Here we choose to conduct the 1D&#10;modeling using only one loop geometry. However, we have to bear in mind&#10;that we aim to model here the average behavior of the pulsating loop&#10;bundle observed with AIA. This simulation would therefore not be&#10;considered to be able to reproduce the details of what could happen more&#10;locally.&#10;&#10;As input to the simulation, we give the loop profile, i.e. the altitude&#10;of each point of the loop, the gravity projected along the loop, and the&#10;magnetic field strength along the loop. The loop expansion is given by&#10;the cross-sectional area , obtained from , and normalized to its value&#10;at the first footpoint. For this quite asymmetric loop, the apex is at&#10;an altitude of 87 Mm at  Mm (i.e. at ), i. e. the loop is skewed towards&#10;one footpoint. But the highest factor of asymmetry in this loop is the&#10;different behavior around the two footpoints. It is worth noting the&#10;shallow slope of the loop around the eastern footpoint (). This behavior&#10;can be seen in the normalized gravity projected along the loop, defined&#10;as with the acceleration of the gravity. While the value of the&#10;projected gravity is close to 1.0 (the field line is close to the&#10;vertical) at the western footpoint (), it remains under 0.6 (in absolute&#10;value) in the eastern leg and drops around the footpoint to reach about&#10;0.1.&#10;&#10;The magnetic field strength is about the same at ( Gauss), where , as at&#10;( Gauss), where . The cross-sectional area at each footpoint is thus&#10;similar. The evolution of the loop cross-sectional area, normalized to&#10;its value at , shows that it is highly non-constant. The loop expansion&#10;factor reaches a value of 38 at  Mm, i.e. before the loop apex.&#10;&#10;To solve the hydrodynamic equations, we use a nonuniform spatial mesh,&#10;fixed in time. Our run uses mesh points. The mesh spacing is  km in the&#10;chromosphere and transition region, increasing to  km in the corona. The&#10;geometry profile taken from the extrapolations is linearly interpolated&#10;at the grid points. We verified that the fine mesh spacing region at low&#10;altitudes in the loop captures the gradients and the movements of the&#10;transition region.&#10;&#10;The heating function used for the simulation is similar to the one from&#10;. This kind of heating function allows us to try different scale heights&#10;at each footpoint, to represent different possible stratifications and&#10;asymmetries of the heating:&#10;&#10;where and  Mm is the thickness of the chromosphere, where the heating is&#10;constant.&#10;&#10; is the volumetric heating rate, expressed in . is the value to which&#10;tends at the apex [^1] and is the value of the heating in the&#10;chromosphere. and are the scale lengths for the energy deposition at the&#10;eastern and western leg of the loop, respectively.&#10;&#10;We tested several heating configurations using&#10;equation \[eq:heating\_model\] (see Section \[sec:paperb\]). Among the&#10;simulations showing TNE cycles we chose one that allowed us to produce a&#10;loop whose thermal behavior, as presented in&#10;Section \[simu\_thermal\_behavior\], matches with the average loop&#10;bundle behavior observed with AIA. We plotted the heating profile used&#10;for this simulation in Figure \[fig:heating\_profile\], with the&#10;following parameters: , ,  Mm and  Mm. The total heating power&#10;integrated over the loop length is about and it is two times larger in&#10;the eastern leg () than in the western leg (). Most of the heating is&#10;concentrated around the loop footpoints since we chose and the profile&#10;is asymmetric.&#10;&#10;[^1]: only if">

  <outline text="Simulation results : thermal evolution of the loop" _note="We simulate the loop evolution during a time sequence of 72 hr and&#10;analyse the loop behavior in response to the heating profile applied.&#10;The evolution of the temperature, density, velocity, and pressure is&#10;represented in Figure \[fig:phy\_param\_simu\] as a function of time and&#10;distance along the loop. On the right hand side of each 2D plots, we&#10;show the time evolution of the corresponding parameter averaged over the&#10;loop apex region, defined as the part of the loop above 90 % of the apex&#10;height. We mark it with the two dotted bars in the lower plot of each&#10;panel. The profiles in the bottom panels correspond to instants of the&#10;simulation, and , marked respectively by the solid and dashed bars in&#10;right hand side plots.&#10;&#10;These profiles show that this loop experiences cyclic TNE pulsations&#10;with aborted condensations, i.e. the apex temperature never falls below&#10;1 MK. These condensations are falling along the western leg which is&#10;heated about half as much as the eastern one. There are pulsations with&#10;a period of about 9 hr for each physical parameter. It is the same&#10;period as observed in the EUV intensities and DEM parameters by . The 2D&#10;plots and the profiles show a large chromospheric part around the&#10;eastern footpoint. It is due to the geometry of the loop, i.e. the&#10;flattened eastern leg of the loop at low altitude. Apart from this&#10;peculiarity in the geometry, this case is similar to Case 10 presented&#10;in Figure 14 of . The cycles seen for all the physical parameters are&#10;nearly identical over the duration of the simulation.&#10;&#10;This loop is relatively hot as the coronal part has a peak temperature&#10;of 3 MK. The temperature always remains above 1.4 MK for the eastern&#10;part of the loop and around the loop apex. It drops to 0.6 MK in the&#10;western leg at the end of the cooling phase, when the condensations are&#10;the strongest. Most of the loop remains in coronal conditions at all&#10;times.&#10;&#10;During the rise of the temperature in the loop, there are upflows at&#10;both the eastern and the western footpoints with a velocity of about .&#10;During the cooling phase, the density decreases to m around the apex and&#10;in the eastern part of the loop. These parts of the loop are drained.&#10;The density increases by a factor of 3 in the western leg due to&#10;condensations. As a consequence, the pressure drops everywhere in the&#10;loop with a minimum value around the apex.&#10;&#10;Due to the drop in the pressure, siphon flows are seen from the eastern&#10;part to the west footpoints (velocity of about ) of the loops.&#10;hypothesize that these siphon flows play a key role in aborting the&#10;condensations. However, this remains to be confirmed as some 2.5D&#10;modeling results show that such siphon flows could actually provide more&#10;density to the condensations .&#10;&#10;The evolution of the density around the apex is delayed compared to the&#10;evolution of the temperature, as expected for a state of TNE , in&#10;conjunction with the periodic evolution of these two parameters. We&#10;notice that the delay between the maxima of temperature and density is&#10;larger than the one between their minima. This property was previously&#10;seen in .">

  <outline text="Potential evidence of asymmetric heating" _note="In Section \[sec:simu\], we have traced magnetic field-lines from a LFFF&#10;extrapolation of event 1 of . We presented a 1D hydrodynamic simulation&#10;of a loop with a geometry taken from one of the extrapolated field lines&#10;matching the contour of detected pulsations. This loop has a large&#10;low-lying portion at its eastern footpoint. Moreover, we found that we&#10;can reproduce the properties of the observed pulsating loops only if&#10;there is more heating at the footpoint with this particular geometry&#10;(see Figure \[fig:heating\_profile\] and Section \[sec:paperb\]). The&#10;full parameter space study will be presented in a forthcoming companion&#10;paper.&#10;&#10;Examining the magnetic topology around the eastern pulsating loops&#10;footpoints, we found one photospheric null-point (at ) and many bald&#10;patches. This particular magnetic topology explains the field line&#10;geometry in this area. In Figure \[fig:spe\_loopfpt\], we show an AIA&#10;view and a side view of the null point and bald patches. In the left&#10;panels, we trace in red the lines matching the pulsating loops, as in&#10;Figure \[fig:carte\_extrapol\]. In the side view, we see that at least&#10;two field lines have a grazing leg (this includes the field-line used&#10;for the simulation), due to the presence of the null-point. In the right&#10;panels, we trace some field lines anchored in the bald patch area in the&#10;East of the region. These blue lines clearly show the different&#10;conditions at their two footpoints. As pointed out in&#10;Figure \[fig:spe\_mag\], we can see in the HMI magnetogram that the&#10;footpoints where we found the null-point and the bald patches are&#10;located on the external side of a plage region. On the magnetogram zoom&#10;(right panel), we can see that the bald patches are located in an area&#10;adjacent to the plage region with many alternations of small scale&#10;negative and positive polarities (pointed by the blue arrow in&#10;Figure \[fig:spe\_mag\]). The low-lying null is located in a meso-scale&#10;area (alternation of positive, negative and positive polarity, pointed&#10;by the yellow arrow in Figure \[fig:spe\_mag\]).&#10;&#10;The specific magnetic topologies and the occurence of permanent&#10;photospheric motions observed in the magnetograms in this area could&#10;favor reconnection . It thus might be evidence for different heating&#10;conditions at each footpoint of these loops, which might conceivably be&#10;the source of the asymmetric heating needed to drive the solution of the&#10;1D simulation into TNE cycles. Although we study here the magnetic&#10;topology of the region at only one date, the magnetograms show this area&#10;of alternation of small scale positive and negative polarities during&#10;the sequence of  6 days. The potential site of reconnection could thus&#10;last for several days and produce quasi-steady favorable conditions for&#10;the appearance of pulsations. Moreover, we made the same extrapolations&#10;as presented in Section \[sec:mag\_extrapol\] using a magnetogram at the&#10;beginning and at the end of the three-day sequence presented in (between&#10;June 05, 2012 11:14 UT and June 08, 2012 11:16 UT). We checked that the&#10;overall geometry of the field lines matching the contour of detected&#10;pulsations (such as asymmetry) does not change significantly between&#10;these two dates and the one studied here.&#10;&#10;Such a potential site of reconnection is likely also present at other&#10;locations in this active region. These heating conditions, as well as&#10;the geometry of the loops studied, are not generic properties of loops&#10;showing long-period intensity pulsations. However, as we will&#10;demonstrate in the companion paper, both the loop geometry and the&#10;heating conditions influence the production of TNE. The pulsating loops&#10;are not characterized by a single common property but rather by a&#10;combination of the right heating conditions and geometry.">

We produce these intensities from the&#10;AIA response functions to isothermal plasma for each channel, calculated&#10;with CHIANTI version 8.0 [^1]. To simulate the intensities as they would&#10;be seen in EUV images, we perform the integration along the line of&#10;sight in the geometry corresponding to that given in&#10;Figure \[fig:carte\_extrapol\]:&#10;&#10;We assume that for the average loop bundle modeled, , and vary slowly&#10;from one section to another, which is valid for the coronal part of the&#10;loop.

We thus approximate&#10;Equation \[eq:synthetic\_intensities\] as:&#10;&#10; is the angle between and the direction of the line of sight, as&#10;illustrated in the sketch of Figure \[fig:sketch\_int\]. The values&#10;along the loop are determined using the projection of along the line of&#10;sight. The values are between and in most of the loop (except for the&#10;footpoints).

With a higher this value would&#10;be higher indeed. However, this does not change the relative evolution&#10;of the intensities along the loop that we aim to study.&#10;&#10;[^1]: We use here the latest version of CHIANTI instead of the one used&#10;    for the radiative loss function for the simulation (version 7.1).The&#10;    differences with the use of CHIANTI version 8.0 for the radiative&#10;    loss function should be very small.">

In the bottom panel, we plot&#10;profiles at  hr, when the condensations are the strongest for this&#10;cycle. The shape of the synthetic intensity along the loop should be&#10;examined only in the coronal part of the loop as the 1D code is not&#10;supposed to model properly the chromosphere. In addition,&#10;Equation \[eq:synthetic\_intensities\] is only true in the case of an&#10;optically thin plasma, and around the loop footpoints the integration&#10;method of Equation \[eq:synthetic\_intensities\_2\] is approximate. We&#10;thus only consider loop profiles between  Mm and  Mm, i.e. outside the&#10;hatched regions. At , the intensity varies smoothly along the loop in&#10;all the channels and is not more than 10 times larger from one side to&#10;another. At , the intensity values are on average larger in all the&#10;bands than at as the loop is cooling, especially for the bands with a&#10;cool temperature response wing : 94 Å, 131 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å. The&#10;335 Å and 211 Å bands are less sensitive to these temperatures. Because&#10;of condensations in the western leg, the differences between the two&#10;legs are larger than at , reaching at 131 Å and 171 Å. However as the&#10;condensations are aborted, there are no sharp structures seen in the&#10;intensity profiles, in contrast to the simulations of . The large&#10;variation between the footpoints at (at 171 Å), is consistent with the&#10;intensity variations visible at 171 Å (variations with a factor of about&#10;80 for the pulsating loop bundle of Figure \[fig:carte\_extrapol\]).&#10;&#10;The 131 Å and 171 Å intensity variations between and at the western&#10;footpoint are large. However, we simulate here a single 1D loop. Due to&#10;line of sight integration of multiple structures, one can expect lower&#10;variations in observations. We can conclude that these results are&#10;consistent with the conclusions from from 3D simulations: a loop&#10;experiencing TNE can have properties that match those of observed loops,&#10;with here the inherent limitations of 1D simulations (single 1D loop).&#10;&#10;">

    <outline text="Analysis of the time lag signature of cooling" _note="We trace the six time series of the synthetic intensities, averaged&#10;around the apex and normalized to their standard deviation (we subtract&#10;the mean curve and divide by their standard deviation) in&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\]. We look at the evolution between 8 hr&#10;and 30 hr after the beginning of the simulation, i.e. approximately two&#10;cycles of the simulation. The synthetic intensity peaks first in the&#10;hotter channels and then in the cooler channels with the following&#10;order: 335 Å, 211 Å, 94 Å (considering the main peak of the response&#10;function), 193 Å, 131 Å, and 171 Å. Since 335 Å peaks first, the plasma&#10;does not reach the temperature of the hotter peaks of the 94 Å and&#10;131 Å channels.&#10;&#10;We perform the same time lag analysis as in with the six light curves of&#10;synthetic intensities (from 5 hr after the beginning of the simulation&#10;to the end of the simulation), averaged around the loop apex (i.e around&#10; Mm). We cross-correlate six pairs of channels, the cross-correlation&#10;values for 94-335, 335-211, 211-195, 335-193, 335-171, and 171-131 can&#10;be seen in Figure \[fig:correl\_int\_loop\_simu\]. All the peak&#10;cross-correlation values are above 0.7, even though the light curves of&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\] can A PRIORI look dissimilar (e.g., the&#10;335 and 171 channels). The time lag values are given in&#10;Table \[table:event\_1\_time\_lag\_contour\].&#10;&#10;According to this method, the peaks in the synthetic intensities follow&#10;each other in the order: 335 Å, 94 Å, 211 Å, 131 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å.&#10;This is not exactly the same order as the position of the peaks seen in&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\]. The time lags determined by the&#10;cross-correlation are influenced not only by the intensity peaks but by&#10;the intensity evolution during the whole cycle. These values thus give a&#10;general tendency (we witness the cooling of the loop) but do not&#10;necessarily give the exact order of the peaks .&#10;&#10;The fact that the EUV loops are generally seen in their cooling phase is&#10;well-known . and argue by means of observations and modeling that the&#10;widespread cooling seen in the active regions implies an impulsive&#10;character of the heating. However, while our simulation uses a constant&#10;heating, we also witness this cooling behavior. As already underlined by&#10;and , simulations of loops with a quasi-constant heating can reproduce&#10;the observed time lags.&#10;&#10;If the temperature evolution in time was fully symmetric (e.g.&#10;cosine-shaped) and the density were constant, we would expect to see two&#10;peaks in each intensity passband (for passbands sensitive to these&#10;temperatures), one when the temperature increases and passes the peak&#10;response of the channel, and another when the temperature decreases and&#10;passes again through the peak response. In this case, we would observe&#10;no systematic time delay between the channels. However, if the rise of&#10;the temperature were faster than the temperature fall and/or if the&#10;density were lower during the heating than during the cooling phase, the&#10;first peak would disappear and a systematic correlation would result.&#10;The time lags observed between the EUV intensities in the corona are&#10;then not necessarily due to the impulsive character of the heating. As&#10;seen in Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\], time lags are observed and the&#10;temperature rise is steeper than the fall while variations of the&#10;density are delayed compared to the temperature. This explains why the&#10;cross correlation picks out on the cooling phase.&#10;&#10;In Figure \[fig:space\_int\_loop\_simu\], we plot the phase diagram for&#10;the loop simulation. We use and averaged around the loop apex, starting&#10;5 hr after the beginning of the simulation. In the background of the&#10;cycles, we displayed the map of , i.e. the volume emissivity of the&#10;plasma (without the integration along the line of sight) for the&#10;193 Å passband. In Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\] we can see that when&#10;the temperature is the highest (above 2.5 MK in absolute value, i.e. ),&#10;the intensity in the 193 Å passband is nearly flat. Indeed, in&#10;Figure \[fig:space\_int\_loop\_simu\], the () cycle spans an area of low&#10;above  MK (). We can see that if the cycle were somewhere else in the ()&#10;domain, the intensity cycle response would be quite different. We&#10;emphasize that the time lags resulting from intensity variations are&#10;sensitive to the combination of and variations and should be interpreted&#10;carefully.">

    <outline text="Comparison with the thermal properties of the observed pulsating loops" _note="We now compare the properties of the synthetic intensity time series&#10;with the ones of the observed loops in .&#10;&#10;In Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_obs\], we present the evolution of the&#10;intensity in the six channels of AIA from observations of event 1 in .&#10;These intensities (at a 13-minute cadence) are averaged over a contour&#10;close to the loop bundle apex . They are plotted in the same way as in&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\]: we zoom on two cycles between 18 hr and&#10;47 hr after the beginning of the sequence. We add also the evolution of&#10;the peak temperature and of the total emission measure from the DEM&#10;analysis of .&#10;&#10;Comparing Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\] and&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_obs\], we can see that the long-term behavior&#10;(the 9 hr cycles) is very well reproduced by our simulation. However in&#10;the simulation, the short-term dynamics is missing. As discussed&#10;previously, our simulation has the inherent limitations of 1D&#10;simulations: only a single loop is studied, with no background emission.&#10;The simulation also assumes a perfectly constant heating, so that it&#10;cannot reproduce the small-scale temporal variations.&#10;&#10;The behavior of the light curves during the heating phase (i.e. the&#10;nearly flat intensity evolution) that is seen in the simulation is also&#10;present in the observations. We can also see that, as in the simulation,&#10;the shape of the 335 Å light curve and ones of the other bands are&#10;different (see at a time around 40 hr in the observations of&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_obs\]).&#10;&#10;The evolution of the peak temperature of the DEM and of the total&#10;emission measure in the observations seem also to be consistent with the&#10;behavior seen in our simulation. However, the total emission measure&#10;evolution is noisy, probably due to the poor constraint on the DEM slope&#10;.&#10;&#10;In Table \[table:event\_1\_time\_lag\_contour\], we present a comparison&#10;between the time lags measured for the observed loops and for the&#10;simulated one. With a same period of intensity pulsations (9 hr), the&#10;time lags between the AIA channels for the observed and the simulated&#10;loop are quite similar, given the inherent limitations of this type of&#10;analysis, as mentioned above for the differences between the&#10;cross-correlation method and the manual determination of the time lags&#10;between peaks. Moreover, as highlighted in , the effects of the&#10;background and foreground emission could change the channel ordering. We&#10;also need to bear in mind that we are comparing our observational&#10;results with the simulated intensities of a single 1D loop. This is&#10;likely to be the biggest source of differences between our observations&#10;and simulations.&#10;&#10;As already noted in Figure \[fig:phy\_param\_simu\] and&#10;Figure \[fig:int\_loop\_simu\], we find by cross-correlations a time&#10;delay between the temperature and the density with a value of&#10;111 minutes. This time delay corresponds to a peak cross-correlation&#10;value greater than 0.9. The time delay between the measured DEM peak&#10;temperature and the total emission measure for the observed pulsating&#10;loops is similar: 119 minutes.&#10;&#10;Therefore the thermal properties of the simulated loop, as the&#10;intensities evolution, are consistent with those of the observed&#10;pulsating loops of .">

<outline text="Relationship with coronal rain" _note="Coronal rain was first observed by and . proposed a model for the&#10;formation of prominences with a heating concentrated at low altitudes.&#10;In , the authors argue for a common formation mechanism for prominences&#10;and coronal rain, namely the loss of thermal equilibrium, giving an&#10;explanation for the formation of mass condensations in the corona.&#10;&#10;However, while TNE is the common physical process to explain coronal&#10;rain, the periodic appearence of coronal rain showers that involves long&#10;periods (several hours) in simulations, has never been observed yet.&#10;Since coronal rain is often observed for durations of less than several&#10;hours, it is impossible to detect a potential periodicity with about the&#10;same period. On the other hand, while several studies suggest that&#10;coronal rain and, by extension, TNE in the corona is a phenomenon that&#10;could be more common than generally thought , a proper quantification of&#10;coronal rain is still lacking.&#10;&#10;The common pulsating behavior of EUV coronal loops, as reported by ,&#10;brings a new interesting element to the understanding of coronal rain&#10;and of the heating of coronal loops. The detailed study of the&#10;thermodynamic behavior of three typical events detected in loops shows&#10;that these observations are evidence for TNE in warm coronal loops .&#10;These long-period EUV intensity pulsations, just like coronal rain, are&#10;due to a TNE state and are thus an observational manifestation of&#10;coronal heating mechanisms. Therefore this widespread behavior observed&#10;in loops tells us both about the localisation of the heating in loops&#10;and about the heating time scale.&#10;&#10;Coronal rain appears to be a different manifestation of the same&#10;phenomenon studied here, except that the condensations, locally in the&#10;corona, seem to be stronger in the case of coronal rain. The long-period&#10;intensity pulsations observed with the coronal channels of AIA and&#10;studied in the present paper can indeed be modeled using a incomplete&#10;condensation scenario. This model can explain the average behavior of&#10;the loop bundle observed. That does not exclude the presence of coronal&#10;rain in these loops, i.e. localized complete condensations. AIA cannot&#10;constrain the behavior of the plasma at transition region and&#10;chromospheric temperatures [^1]. Moreover, the spatial resolution is not&#10;sufficient with AIA to observe coronal rain easily , especially on the&#10;disk.&#10;&#10;The temperature of these condensations could for example drop to&#10;chromospheric temperatures, with the rest of the plasma remaining at&#10;coronal temperatures. It is also possible that we observed only the&#10;beginning of a progressive cooling. In fact, temperatures at a part of&#10;the western leg of the simulated loop do drop to transition region&#10;temperatures (see Figure \[fig:phy\_param\_simu\]). This model is not&#10;inconsistent with the observations of , i.e. downflows to only&#10;transition region temperatures and not to chromospheric ones. Further&#10;work is needed to understand the nature of the condensations associated&#10;with the long-period intensity pulsation events detected.&#10;&#10;An alternative interpretation to TNE to explain the observations of&#10;long-period intensity pulsating loops might be the self-organization of&#10;loops to a state of marginal collisionality, as simulated by . In this&#10;paper, the authors simulated coronal loops ( 50 Mm long) with a 1D&#10;hydrodynamic code, testing the model proposed by and . They assumed that&#10;the loops are heated by magnetic reconnections with a density-dependent&#10;heating rate. The plasma is self-regulated, with footpoint evaporations&#10;and downflow evacuations. This behavior causes pulsations in the&#10;temperature and density of the loops with periods of severals tens of&#10;minutes. These periods are smaller than the ones that we observed but&#10;the simulated loops are shorter too. However, even if the plasma&#10;behavior has several similarities with the one we observed in , the&#10;temperature and density evolutions are anti-correlated, which is not&#10;what we observe. An analysis of the velocity of the flows in the&#10;observations could be another way to distingush between the two models.&#10;&#10;[^1]: However, it is worthnoting that we do not we use the 304 channel&#10;    because we do not detect pulsations in this passband.">

<outline text="Summary" _note="In , the physical behavior of long-period EUV intensity loop events was&#10;examined. We concluded that these show evidence for cycles of&#10;evaporation and incomplete condensation and thus for TNE.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we use an 1D hydrodynamic simulation with a realistic&#10;loop geometry from LFFF extrapolations. We choose an highly-stratified&#10;and asymmetric heating function to reproduce the period of pulsation and&#10;the temperature deduced from the observations. With this 1D hydrodynamic&#10;description we are able to reproduce the long-term variations of our&#10;observations for NOAA AR 11499 , i.e., the intensity pulsations in the&#10;six coronal channels of AIA (with 9 hr of period) with realistic time&#10;lags between the channels around the loop apex. This supports an&#10;explanation of long-period intensity pulsations in terms of TNE.&#10;&#10;argue that the time lags, and thus the cooling observed in active&#10;regions, are consistent with nanoflare storm models involving&#10;low-frequency nanoflares. During such nanoflare storms many nanoflare&#10;events occur along the structure considered. The low-frequency here&#10;implies that the time delay between two heating events is longer than&#10;the typical cooling time. This allows time for the plasma to cool before&#10;it is reheated. In our case, we use a constant heating, mainly localized&#10;at low altitude, but we witness the same cooling behavior. This was also&#10;highlighted in 3D simulations with a quasi-constant and highly&#10;stratified heating in and . It is thus worth noting that high-frequency&#10;heating models are also consistent with the time lags observed. The&#10;observed cooling alone is thus not sufficient to discriminate between&#10;the heating mechanisms.&#10;&#10;For the present loop geometry, we can only reproduce the cycles of&#10;evaporation and condensation with a highly-stratified and asymmetric&#10;heating profile. Moreover, we found a low-lying null point and many bald&#10;patches around the eastern loop footpoint. This topology, which is not&#10;seen around the western footpoint, represents a potential site of&#10;preferential reconnection at one footpoint, leading to asymmetric&#10;heating, which is a key ingredient to reproduce our observations. The&#10;sensitivity of the production of such cycles to both loop geometry and&#10;heating geometry will be examined in a future paper.&#10;&#10;In conclusions, our simulation further strengthens the interpretation of&#10;the observed pulsations in terms of TNE, as proposed by .&#10;&#10;This work is an outgrowth of the work presented during the VII Coronal&#10;Loop Workshop and at Hinode 9.
