<outline text="Introduction" _note="Pulsating variables between the instability strips of Scuti and Slowly&#10;Pulsating B-type (SPB) stars have been suggested many years ago by&#10;Struve . Although later a member of the Pleiades Maia appeared to be a&#10;constant star (Struve ), the idea remained and the search have continued&#10;for many years (McNamara , Scholz ). Finally, the analysis of a 7-year&#10;observation campaign of the open cluster NGC 3766 led to the discovery&#10;of a large number of variable stars (Mowlavi et al. ). Amongst them the&#10;authors found 36 new variables, which according to the position on the&#10;color-magnitude diagram, have the spectral types between late type B and&#10;early type A. The periods of their light variability are from the range&#10;of about 0.1 - 0.7 \[d\], corresponding to the frequencies of about 1.4&#10;- 10 \[d\], and the photometric amplitudes are of the order of a few&#10;millimagnitudes. The very recent work by Mowlavi et al. showed that most&#10;of them rotate fast (with ) which supports the hypothesis that Maia&#10;pulsators are fast rotating SPB stars (Salmon et al. .)&#10;&#10;This new type of variables was also suggested from the analysis of space&#10;data. From the Kepler photometry, Balona et al. found B-type stars with&#10;high frequencies and low amplitudes. These stars are located below the&#10;red edge of the Cep instability strip and some of them can be considered&#10;as Maia candidates. Several candidates are also from the CoRoT&#10;observations (Degroote et al. ).&#10;&#10;In this paper, assuming the pulsational origin of this variability, we&#10;test a few hypotheses. Because NGC3766 is a very young open cluster, we&#10;consider only Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) models. The first and&#10;already studied hypothesis involves the very high rotation. In the&#10;second, new scenario, we modify the opacity profile in order to excite&#10;pulsational modes in the required frequency range in the rotating models&#10;with masses below . The last hypothesis demands the modifications of the&#10;opacity profile and higher degree modes (up to 6-8) and works for both,&#10;low and fast rotating stars of B8-A2 spectral type. Sect.2 presents the&#10;results of our modelling and conclusions are give in Summary.">

<outline text="The three explanations" _note="[**The first hypothesis:\&#10;fast rotating stars with underestimated masses**]{}&#10;&#10;In this scenario, Maia stars are linked to fast rotating Slowly&#10;Pulsating B-type stars. The fast rotation causes that masses of the&#10;stars seen close equator-on are underestimated (Salmon et al. ). We&#10;perform pulsational computations for models with masses in the framework&#10;of the traditional approximation (e.g. Lee &amp; Saio , Townsend , Savonije&#10;). As mentioned above, NGC3766 is a very young open cluster, thus we&#10;analysed only ZAMS models. The initial hydrogen abundance and&#10;metallicity were set at 0.7 and 0.015, respectively, and the chemical&#10;mixture was adopted from Asplund at al. . Here, we show results obtained&#10;with the OPAL opacities (Iglesias &amp; Rogers ) but with the OPLIB (Colgan&#10;et al. ) and OP data (Seaton ), the results are qualitatively similar.&#10;&#10;High order gravity modes as well as mixed gravity-Rossby modes are&#10;considered. In models with masses corresponding to B8-A2 type, these&#10;modes are stable. Their instability begins from the mass of about .&#10;Moreover, including the effects of rotation on g modes, both, enhances&#10;the pulsational instability and causes the shift of modes to the higher&#10;frequency range. In Fig.1, we plot the instability parameter, , as a&#10;function of mode frequency for a ZAMS model with a mass , effective&#10;temperature, . and rotational velocity . The parameter is the normalized&#10;work integral and for unstable modes it takes positive values. For&#10;clarity, we depicted only modes which become unstable () in some range&#10;of frequencies.&#10;&#10;[**The second hypothesis:\&#10;fast rotating stars with non-standard opacities**]{}&#10;&#10;In the second, new scenario, we continued pulsational computations with&#10;the traditional approximation but additionally we modified the mean&#10;opacity profile in models with masses below . The standard opacities&#10;were increased at the depth corresponding to temperature . This&#10;modification mimics the new opacity bump identified in the Kurucz&#10;atmosphere models (Cugier ). This new bump was suggested, for example,&#10;as a possible cause of excitation of low frequency g-modes in Scuti&#10;stars as detected in the Kepler data (Balona et al. ). The effect of&#10;increasing the OPAL opacities by 100% at is presented in Fig.2. A model&#10;with the mass on ZAMS was considered. The rotational rate was . For&#10;models with such masses, pulsational computations with the standard&#10;opacities model do not predict any instability. As one can see, it is&#10;more than enough to consider modes with the degree to cover the&#10;frequency range observed in the NGC3766 stars.&#10;&#10;[**The third hypothesis:\&#10;slow rotating stars with non-standard opacities**]{}&#10;&#10;The third explanation involves modifications of the opacity profile and&#10;including modes with the harmonic degrees up to 8. Here, we performed&#10;all pulsational computations assuming the zero-rotation approximation,&#10;i.e., all effects of rotation on pulsations were neglected.&#10;&#10;We found that by increasing the mean opacity at the depth in a model, it&#10;is possible to get the instability in the observed frequency range for&#10;modes with . Adding opacity at the Z-bump () makes also the dipole modes&#10;unstable. This scenario works for, both, slow and fast rotating stars of&#10;B8-A2 type. Below, we show the results obtained with the modified OPAL&#10;data. We added 150% of the opacity at and 50% of the opacity at . As one&#10;can see, in the mass range corresponding to late B-type and early A-type&#10;stars, , high degree modes () can reach frequencies as high as about 9&#10;d. Considering modes with such high degrees is justified by the fact&#10;that the amplitudes of the new variable stars in NGC3766 are very low&#10;and only very long campaign (about 7 years) allowed to detect them.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Summary" _note="Here, we discussed three possible explanations for pulsations in Maia&#10;stars. Each of them has its strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;Fast rotating stars seen equator-on can account for pulsations of the&#10;Maia type. This hypothesis has been already explored by Salmon et al. .&#10;In this case, we demand the close equator-on orientation for all stars.&#10;As a consequence, all modes which have an equatorial node are not good&#10;candidates. It is worth to mention that prograde sectoral modes reach&#10;the highest visibility on the equator (e.g. Salmon et al. ,&#10;Daszyńska-Daszkiewicz et al. ). On the other hand, given the fact that&#10;there are not many identified Maia variables this scenario is plausible.&#10;Moreover, it is strengthened by the recent result of Mowlavi et al. who&#10;showed that all new-class variables in NGC 3766 are fast rotators.&#10;&#10;Two new scenarios involve modifications of the mean opacity profile. We&#10;showed that an increase of the opacity at is indispensable to get the&#10;instability in the frequency range 1.4 – 10 d in the models with masses&#10;. The above conclusions are valid if the effects of rotation on&#10;pulsations are taken in to account. In the case of g-mode pulsations, we&#10;do this via the traditional approximation. If the effects of rotation on&#10;pulsation are neglected then, additionally to the opacity modifications,&#10;the higher modes have to be considered.&#10;&#10;Here, we need quite significant modifications of the opacities which&#10;have to be justified at some point. There are some results that supports&#10;such approach, e.g., by increasing the opacity at the depth it is&#10;possible to explain low frequency g-modes in Scuti stars detected in the&#10;Kepler data (Balona et al. ). Given that there are still many&#10;uncertainties in computations of stellar opacities and, for example, in&#10;case of hybrid B-type pulsators significant modifications have been&#10;suggested (Daszyńska-Daszkiewicz et al. ), such hypothesis for Maia&#10;variables is reasonable. Additionally, these two hypothesis do not have&#10;any requirements for the inclination angle and all unstable modes can be&#10;considered. The third explanation needs the higher degree modes, up to&#10;8, which have poorer visibility. However, given the low values of the&#10;observed amplitudes and the lack of knowledge of the selection&#10;mechanism, we should allow such a possibility. Moreover, the often&#10;forgotten fact is that while the mode visibility is getting worse with&#10;higher according to the disc averaging effects, it increases as&#10;according to the geometrical factor (e.g. Daszyńska-Daszkiewicz et al.&#10;). The explanation with the opacity modifications and higher modes works&#10;for both fast and slow rotators.&#10;&#10;To decide which scenario is preferred, firstly, more determinations of&#10;the rotational velocity of these stars are needed. Then, pulsational&#10;analysis of more Maia stars has to be performed taking into account&#10;various effects on pulsational instability. It cannot be ruled out that&#10;rotation and opacity modification can work together and hold the key to&#10;solving the Maia star problem.">
