<outline text="Introduction" _note="In these proceedings we summarise our progress on the properties of&#10;baryons as obtained from the functional approach (Dyson-Schwinger and&#10;Bethe-Salpeter equations) to QCD. All topics discussed in this&#10;contribution are covered in much more detail in a very recent review on&#10;baryons as covariant three-quark bound states .&#10;&#10;Understanding the baryon excitation spectrum of QCD and the internal&#10;structure of baryons using electromagnetic and other probes is one of&#10;the key elements in unravelling the structure of the strong interaction.&#10;In the past years, significant experimental progress has been made by&#10;the analysis of data from photo- and electroproduction experiments at&#10;JLAB, ELSA and MAMI . As a result, a number of new radial and orbital&#10;excitations of the ground-state baryons have been added to the PDG .&#10;&#10;On the theoretical side, a number of non-perturbative methods contribute&#10;a number of interesting aspects to our understanding of baryons, which&#10;are not always in agreement with each other. In general, the quark model&#10;still serves as a possible standard by which one may define and&#10;distinguish the ‘expected’ from the ‘unexpected’. Its discussion along&#10;the years has created a list of standard problems in baryon physics .&#10;Amongst these are the problem of missing resonances and, related, the&#10;question whether baryons should better be described as quark-diquark&#10;rather than three-quark states, thus reducing the number of possible&#10;internal excitations. On the other hand, dynamical coupled-channel&#10;calculations have suggested that parts of the spectrum may even be&#10;generated purely dynamically, i.e. without a ‘bare’ three-quark or&#10;quark-diquark seed . Lattice QCD contributes its own share with fairly&#10;small error bars and very good agreement between different lattice&#10;groups and approaches for most ground-state masses. Differences,&#10;however, occur for the excited states, where a number of technical&#10;subtleties still obscure the picture.&#10;&#10;In the past years we explored another non-perturbative approach to QCD,&#10;namely the functional methods of Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter&#10;equations (DSEs and BSEs). They can be used on different levels of&#10;sophistication, ranging from NJL-like truncations with contact&#10;interactions, quark-diquark models using ansätze for propagators and&#10;wave functions as input, rainbow-ladder truncations using effective&#10;quark-gluon interactions, to beyond-rainbow-ladder approaches explicitly&#10;solving a range of underlying DSEs for the QCD Green’s functions; see &#10;for an overview. In the work summarised here we have used the&#10;rainbow-ladder truncation as a minimal baseline but also explored&#10;effects beyond rainbow-ladder. In addition, we do not rely on the widely&#10;used quark-diquark approximation but provided first solutions for the&#10;masses of ground and selected excited states as well as baryon form&#10;factors from the three-body Faddeev equation. We are therefore in a&#10;position to be able to systematically compare both approaches using the&#10;same underlying assumptions for the quark-gluon interaction.&#10;&#10;Our results for the light baryon spectrum will be discussed in&#10;Sec. \[sec-3\]. Corresponding results for form factors will be the topic&#10;of Sec. \[sec-4\], with a focus on the electromagnetic form factors.&#10;First, however, we outline the framework in the next section.">

<outline text="The functional approach" _note="In functional frameworks the masses and wave functions of baryons are&#10;extracted from their gauge-invariant poles in the (gauge-dependent)&#10;quark six-point Green function. This procedure is related to the&#10;corresponding one in lattice QCD, see Ref.  for more detailed&#10;explanations. An exact equation that can be derived in this approach is&#10;the covariant three-body Faddeev equation in Fig. \[fig:faddeev\]. Its&#10;ingredients are the fully dressed quark propagator (solid line with open&#10;circle) as well as the quark two-body and irreducible three-body&#10;interactions. The latter ones have been neglected so far. The equation&#10;determines the baryon’s Faddeev amplitude (the shaded half-sphere) and&#10;the baryon bound-state mass.&#10;&#10;A considerable simplification is obtained once the quark-diquark&#10;approximation is chosen. To this end, one expands the quark-quark&#10;scattering matrix in terms of separable diquark contributions, resulting&#10;in the quark-diquark Bethe-Salpeter equation in the top-right corner of&#10;Fig. \[fig:quark-diquark\]. Its main ingredients are again the dressed&#10;quark propagator, the diquark propagator (double line with open circle)&#10;as well as the diquark Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. In turn, the latter&#10;needs to be calculated from the diquark Bethe-Salpeter equation (bottom&#10;center diagram of Fig. \[fig:quark-diquark\]). The dressed quark&#10;propagator is determined from its Dyson-Schwinger equation (bottom left&#10;diagram of Fig. \[fig:quark-diquark\]).&#10;&#10;An important question in connection with the diquark approximation is&#10;how many diquarks to consider. It turns out that the diquarks with&#10;smallest mass are the scalar and axialvector ones . While both of these&#10;contribute to the nucleon, the baryon can only be made of an axialvector&#10;diquark due to the symmetry properties of the diquark wave functions.&#10;Thus, scalar and axialvector diquarks together constitute a minimal set&#10;of diquarks necessary to consider. However, as it turns out, the parity&#10;partners of the nucleon and the the cannot be described adequately&#10;without including the heavier pseudoscalar and vector diquarks in&#10;addition . Thus in the diquark calculation of the spectrum discussed&#10;below all four types of diquarks have been taken into account.&#10;&#10;A systematic comparison between the three-body and diquark-quark&#10;approach is only possible once the same underlying quark-gluon&#10;interaction is chosen . This distinguishes a quark-diquark approach&#10;based on the dynamics of the underlying QCD from quark-diquark models .&#10;In our case we choose the effective interaction introduced by Maris and&#10;Tandy in Ref. ; details are discussed e.g. in . In this rainbow-ladder&#10;framework the two-body interaction kernel between two quarks is&#10;approximated by the exchange of an effective gluon, which contains the&#10;gluon propagator supplemented by those effects of the quark-gluon vertex&#10;that can be captured by a function depending on the gluon momentum only.&#10;&#10;In the rainbow-ladder approximation one arrives at an interaction&#10;entirely of vector-vector type. In the heavy quark sector it is known&#10;that such types of interactions are not sufficient to account for the&#10;different effects due to spin-spin and spin-orbit dependent forces&#10;between the quarks, and hence cannot describe all meson channels&#10;sufficiently well. In practice, it turns out that the meson spectrum in&#10;the pseudoscalar, vector and some tensor channels are well represented&#10;in rainbow-ladder, while others suffer from too much binding . In  a&#10;simple procedure has been devised to remedy this problem within the&#10;quark-diquark approach. Scalar and axialvector diquarks are well&#10;represented in rainbow-ladder, whereas the pseudoscalar and vector ones&#10;are too light. Reducing the interaction strength in these channels by a&#10;common factor gauged by the splitting remedies this problem.">

<outline text="Light baryon spectrum" _note="In Fig. \[spectrum\] we show the resulting spectra from the three-body&#10;calculation (left diagram, open boxes), the quark-diquark approximation&#10;without correction (left diagram, filled boxes) and the quark-diquark&#10;approximation with improved pseudoscalar and vector diquarks (right&#10;diagram, filled boxes)  and compare them with the two-, three- and&#10;four-star states given by the PDG .&#10;&#10;Let us first discuss the nucleon channel. In the left diagram we observe&#10;good agreement of the three-body with the quark-diquark approach for the&#10;ground-state nucleon as well as the first radially excited state. The&#10;mass of the latter agrees well with the Breit-Wigner mass of the Roper&#10;shown as a red shaded box[^1]. The next two excited states are&#10;(numerically) only accessible in the quark-diquark framework and lie in&#10;the same ballpark as the PDG’s N(1710) and N(1880). In the nucleon&#10;channel with negative parity, both approaches still agree very well but&#10;the states are generally much too low. Clearly, this reflects the above&#10;discussed deficiency of the rainbow-ladder approximation.&#10;&#10;A similar picture is observed in the various channels. The quantitative&#10;agreement between the quark-diquark and the three-body approach is&#10;somewhat less pronounced than in the nucleon case but still satisfied on&#10;a semi-quantitative level. Taken at face value, this could mean that&#10;interactions beyond the diquark approximation could be more important&#10;for states than for baryons of nucleon type. This hypothesis needs to be&#10;tested in the future. Again, the (s-wave) -channel delivers results for&#10;the ground and first radially excited state in agreement with&#10;experiment, while its parity partners and the other two channels are&#10;poorly represented.&#10;&#10;The picture changes when the deficiencies of the rainbow-ladder&#10;approximation are accounted for by adjusting the binding in the&#10;pseudoscalar and vector diquark channels. As explained above, this is&#10;done by introducing one parameter that is adjusted by the splitting;&#10;everything else is unchanged. The influence of this adjustment depends&#10;on the quantum numbers of the baryon due to different weights of the&#10;corresponding diquark contributions as compared to the scalar and&#10;axialvector one. It is therefore highly non-trivial that the states&#10;arrange themselves in the one-to-one correspondence with the&#10;experimental ones as observed in the right diagram of Fig. \[spectrum\].&#10;Without further corrections, the level ordering between the positive and&#10;negative nucleon parity sector comes out correctly on a quantitative&#10;level. Not only the first radial excitations but also the second and&#10;third ones are close to experimental states. We therefore arrive at a&#10;consistent and quantitative description of the light baryon spectrum&#10;below 2 GeV.&#10;&#10;Of course this does not mean that beyond rainbow-ladder effects, like&#10;pion-cloud and coupled-channel effects, or further non-Abelian&#10;corrections on the gluon level are absent . Our results merely suggest&#10;that these effects are opposite in sign and largely cancel each other in&#10;the nucleon and channels, whereas in the other channels there is a net&#10;effect that can be absorbed by the extra parameter for the pseudoscalar&#10;and vector diquarks that we introduced. In fact, in the meson sector&#10;there are strong indications that cancellations between non-Abelian&#10;corrections  and pion cloud effects  occur. Both effects have already&#10;been explored for baryons on an exploratory level  and work will&#10;continue in this direction.&#10;&#10;Also very encouraging are the results for the strange baryon sector&#10;reported for the three-body framework in . Here the masses of&#10;ground-state octet and decuplet baryons have been reproduced on the&#10;few-percent level, while the calculation of excited states still needs&#10;to be performed.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The mass evolution of the Roper with varying pion mass is&#10;    discussed in  and compared with results from lattice QCD.">

<outline text="Selected form factors: electromagnetic  form factor" _note="Form factors in the functional approach are calculated by coupling&#10;external currents to equations for Green functions. In the three-body&#10;approach, electromagnetic form factors , axial form factors  and hyperon&#10;form factors  have been calculated and reviewed in . Here we discuss&#10;aspects of the electromagnetic form factors for the , which have been&#10;determined in the three-body approach  as well as in the quark-diquark&#10;approximation . In Fig. \[fig:delta-ffs\] we display corresponding&#10;results for the electric monopole and quadrupole form factor as well as&#10;the magnetic dipole and octupole form factor. We compare them with&#10;results from lattice QCD  using different values for the up/down quark&#10;masses corresponding to different pion masses.&#10;&#10;It is interesting to compare the three-body with the quark-diquark&#10;results. For the electric monopole form factor both approaches agree&#10;very well. The limit of vanishing photon momentum, , is constrained by&#10;charge conservation, which is guaranteed automatically in our framework&#10;due to gauge invariance. For all values the agreement with lattice&#10;results is furthermore on a quantitative level. The electric quadrupole&#10;form factor, however, is more sensitive to the internal structure of the&#10;baryon, as can be seen in the bottom left diagram of&#10;Fig. \[fig:delta-ffs\]. Here the results from the three-body and the&#10;quark-diquark approach display a different momentum behaviour and even a&#10;different sign at large momenta. The same signature is found for the&#10;magnetic form factors. While the dipole results agree with each other&#10;(apart from a small region at very low ), the octupole component has a&#10;different sign for all . Thus, high precision lattice results are&#10;clearly able to distinguish between them. Given the presently available&#10;set of data for the electric quadrupole component, there may be a slight&#10;tendency towards the three-body results. However, the accuracy is not&#10;good enough to make a definite statement. Thus, it would be very&#10;interesting to repeat the lattice calculation with today’s technical and&#10;numerical resources.&#10;&#10;While experimental results for the form factors are not available,&#10;static quantities like its magnetic moment can be extracted. These are&#10;shown in the bottom right plot of Fig. \[fig:delta-ffs\]. Compared are&#10;the bands for the quark-diquark results with the experimental data for&#10;the and the baryon. The agreement with the central value of the&#10;experimental error bar is very good. Note that the magnetic moments are&#10;real, since in the rainbow-ladder approximation used in the present&#10;approach decay channels are not included, see the review Ref.  for a&#10;more detailed discussion of this aspect. As discussed before, the&#10;magnetic moment of the extracted from the magnetic dipole form factor&#10;shows a small discrepancy between the three-body and the quark-diquark&#10;results. Thus also more precise experimental results have the potential&#10;to discriminate between the two.&#10;&#10;In general, we confirm the baryon’s deformation as encoded in its&#10;electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole form factors.&#10;Non-relativistically, a negative sign for the electric quadrupole moment&#10;indicates an oblate charge distribution for the in the Breit frame .&#10;From the measurement of the transition one can infer the value in the&#10;large- limit ; comparable values are predicted by a range of&#10;constituent-quark models . These numbers are in the ballpark of the&#10;lattice and DSE results displayed in Fig. \[fig:delta-ffs\].">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="Baryon spectroscopy, baryon structure and baryon dynamics remain very&#10;active and lively fields. Dedicated experiments at many facilities such&#10;as Jefferson Lab, BESIII, ELSA, J-PARC, LHCb, MAMI and the future&#10;PANDA/FAIR experiment are contributing and will continue to contribute&#10;to our understanding of the baryonic world. On the theory side, the past&#10;years have seen continuous advances in connecting the underlying quark&#10;and gluon interactions of QCD with baryon phenomenology.&#10;&#10;In functional approaches, the challenges are to capitalize on continuous&#10;improvements to the truncation/approximation schemes. While the aim is&#10;not to enter the realm of high precision physics on the sub-percent&#10;level, much can be achieved in the way of understanding the underlying&#10;mechanisms that generate the observed phenomena. A prime example of this&#10;is the question of three-quark vs. a quark-diquark structure of baryons.&#10;At face value, the results reported in this contribution suggest that&#10;irreducible three-body forces inside baryons may be subdominant compared&#10;to two-body interactions. If this is the case, the quark-diquark&#10;approximation should be fine. Indeed, accounting for well-known&#10;deficiencies in the rainbow-ladder truncation of the quark-quark&#10;interaction, we found a spectrum of ground and excited states of light&#10;baryons in one-to-one agreement with experiment. This highly non-trivial&#10;result is very encouraging and suggests further extensions of our work&#10;to the strange baryon sector and quantum numbers beyond and .&#10;&#10;On the other hand, we have seen that form factors may serve to&#10;distinguish between a three-body and a quark-diquark picture of baryons&#10;via static quantities at low momenta and the dynamical behaviour at&#10;larger momenta. While the former can be tested by more precise&#10;experiments, the latter can be accessed by lattice QCD.&#10;&#10;[**Acknowledgement**]{}\&#10;The work reported here would not have been possible without the support&#10;from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the SFB/TR16.
