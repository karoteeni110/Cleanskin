<outline text="Sums of products of Fubini polynomials" _note="In this section we define two variable Fubini polynomials and obtain&#10;some basic properties which give us new formulas for Moreover we shall&#10;consider the sums of products of two Fubini polynomials. The sums of&#10;products of various polynomials and numbers with or without binomial&#10;coefficients have been studied (e.g., ).&#10;&#10;Two variable Fubini polynomials are defined by means of the following&#10;generating function For some special cases of (\[8\]), we have&#10;&#10;We can rewrite (\[8\]) as Comparing the coefficients of yields&#10;&#10;From (\[8\]) we have Comparing the coefficients of gives Thus, setting&#10;and in (\[4\]) we find respectively. Combining these relations with&#10;(\[3\]) gives the equations (\[5\]) and (\[6\]) which were obtained by&#10;using Euler-Siedel matrix method in .&#10;&#10;Now, we want to give the generalization of the binomial formula (\[5\]).&#10;Derivative of (\[8\]) can be written as Taking leads and By equating the&#10;coefficients of we get For in the above equation, using (\[9\]) give the&#10;sums of products of the Fubini polynomials.&#10;&#10;\[teo1\]For When this becomes&#10;&#10;Now, we investigate the sums of products of the Fubini polynomials for&#10;different values in the following theorem.&#10;&#10;For and ,&#10;&#10;The products of (\[8\]) can be written as Using the same method as in&#10;the proof of Theorem \[teo1\] we have For in the above equation gives&#10;the desired equation.&#10;&#10;As we know, for Fubini polynomials reduce to Fubini numbers. We now&#10;point out (see ) that Fubini numbers arise for other value of , too. If&#10;we take in place of in (\[8\]) we have Setting in the above equation and&#10;using the relation (\[7\]) we have the reflection formula Therefore,&#10;using (\[2\]) gives a new explicit formula for Fubini polynomials in the&#10;following theorem.&#10;&#10;\[teo4\]For we obtain&#10;&#10;Note that, when (\[21\]) reduce to .

<outline text="Integrals of products of Fubini polynomials" _note="The integrals of products of various polynomials and functions have been&#10;studied (e.g., ). In this section we deal with an integral for a product&#10;of two Fubini polynomials. First we need the following Lemma \[lem1\]&#10;and Lemma \[lem2\].&#10;&#10;\[lem1\]For all and we have where is the Stirling numbers of the fist&#10;kind ().&#10;&#10;We prove (\[25\]) by induction on The case of (\[25\]) is known from&#10;(\[26\]).

The above equation is equivalent to The matrix on the right hand&#10;side is easily decipherable. Elementwise it is The latter sum simply&#10;equals to as it is known (see ). Hence our original statement equals to&#10;the matrix equation This is nothing else but the reformulation of the&#10;fact that the second and signed first kind Stirling matrices are&#10;inverses of each other.&#10;&#10;Now, we are ready to give the integrals of products of Fubini&#10;polynomials. Using (\[2\]) we have Then, interchanging the sum and&#10;integral in the above equation and using (\[25\]) yield Finally, using&#10;Lemma \[lem2\] gives the following theorem.&#10;&#10;\[teo2\]For all and we have&#10;&#10;Using the representation (\[2\]) in (\[30\]) and integrating termwise&#10;one obtains This double sum identity extends (\[32\]).&#10;&#10;In order to give an application of Lemma \[lem1\], now we emphasize the&#10;summation in the right hand of (\[25\]).

<outline text="Applications" _note="Apostol-Bernoulli functions have the following explicit expression Thus&#10;for The functions are rational functions in the second variable, . These&#10;functions were introduced by Apostol in order to evaluate the Lerch&#10;transcendent (also Lerch zeta function) for negative integer values of&#10;and also were studied and generalized recently in a number of papers,&#10;under the name Apostol-Bernoulli numbers.&#10;&#10;Comparing the (\[53\]) to (\[2\]) Apostol-Bernoulli functions can be&#10;expressed by Fubini polynomials as ()&#10;&#10;We can use this relation to obtain some new properties of For example&#10;setting in (\[21\]) we have which was obtained in . Similarly, from&#10;Thereom \[teo1\] we get the sums of products of Apostol-Bernoulli&#10;functions as given in by different method. Moreover, using the equation&#10;(\[84\]) of Theorem \[teo5\] gives a new explicit formula for&#10;Apostol-Bernoulli functions.&#10;&#10;For and&#10;&#10;To give a different application of the relation (\[22\]), first we deal&#10;with Lemma \[lem1\].
