    <title>Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg interferometry with driving fields in the
quantum regime</title>
    <abstract>We analyze the dynamics of a two-level quantum system (TLS) under the
influence of a strong sinusoidal driving signal whose origin is the
interaction of the two-level system with a quantum field. In this
approach the driving field is replaced by a harmonic oscillator that is
either strongly coupled to the TLS or populated with a large number of
photons. Starting from the Rabi model, we derive expressions for the
TLS’s oscillation frequencies and compare the results with those
obtained from the model where the driving signal is treated classically.
We show that in the limits of weak coupling and large photon number, the
well-known expression for the Rabi frequency in the strong driving
regime is recovered. In the opposite limit of strong coupling and small
photon number, we find differences between the predictions of the
semiclassical and quantum models. The results of the quantum picture can
therefore be understood as Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg interferometry in
the fully quantum regime. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg (LZS) interferometry is encountered when a&#10;parameter of a quantum system are varied periodically in time such that&#10;the system repeatedly traverses an avoided crossing in its energy level&#10;diagram . The response of the quantum system under such strong driving&#10;exhibits characteristic two-dimensional interference patterns that&#10;reflect the effects of interference involving the two traversals in a&#10;single driving period as well as the interference between operations&#10;corresponding to different driving periods. This situation has been the&#10;subject of numerous studies in recent years, covering both theory and&#10;experiment .&#10;&#10;In the LZS problem, the driving field is generally treated classically,&#10;and only the driven two-level system is treated quantum mechanically.&#10;This picture can be considered a semiclassical approximation of a fully&#10;quantum treatment where the sinusoidal driving field is replaced by a&#10;harmonic oscillator that contains a large number of photons and hence&#10;behaves classically.&#10;&#10;One can then ask the question: what happens when the driving field is&#10;treated quantum mechanically? In this paper we use the Rabi model to&#10;address this question. The closest that one can come to a classical&#10;signal in a quantum harmonic oscillator is a coherent state. Indeed we&#10;show that in the semiclassical limit with coherent states containing a&#10;large number of excitation quanta the predictions of the semiclassical&#10;and fully quantum models agree, although the results are described by&#10;seemingly different mathematical functions. One can expect that for&#10;coherent states with a small number of excitation quanta the&#10;discreteness of the oscillator’s energy levels and the fluctuations in&#10;photon number relative to the average value start to have noticeable&#10;effects on the dynamics of the driven two-level system. We find that&#10;these are not the only deviations that the fully quantum model exhibits&#10;in relation to the semiclassical model. For example, starting with a&#10;well-defined photon number one could still obtain non-decaying&#10;sinusoidal oscillations but with a frequency that is completely&#10;different from what the semiclassical model predicts. We shall analyze&#10;this point and other similarities and differences in the predictions of&#10;the two models.&#10;&#10;The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in&#10;Sec. \[Sec:SemiclassicalAndQuantumPictures\] we introduce the&#10;semiclassical and fully quantum models for describing a driven two-level&#10;system. In Sec. \[Sec:WeakDrivingCoupling\] we review the case of weak&#10;driving. In Sec. \[Sec:StrongDriving\] we address the case of strong&#10;driving and LZS interferometry, as seen in the semiclassical and quantum&#10;models. We analyze the expressions for the Rabi frequency in the two&#10;models and compare the two expressions. In&#10;Sec. \[Sec:TimeDomainSimulations\] we present the results of time-domain&#10;simulations of the dynamics, giving a different perspective on the&#10;problem. We conclude with some final remarks in Sec. \[Sec:Conclusion\].">

<outline text="Semiclassical and fully quantum pictures" _note="We consider a two-level quantum system (to which we shall also refer as&#10;a qubit) driven by an external field with a sinusoidal time dependence.&#10;Specifically, we consider the Hamiltonian where is the minimum energy&#10;gap at the avoided crossing point, is the average bias point relative to&#10;the so-called symmetry point (), , and are, respectively, the amplitude,&#10;frequency and phase of the sinusoidal driving signal, and are qubit&#10;Pauli operators. When exceeds by an amount that is large compared to ,&#10;the coefficient of the second term in the Hamiltonian oscillates between&#10;positive and negative values such that a sequence of Landau-Zener&#10;traversals is encountered, and the physics of LZS interferometry is&#10;realized.&#10;&#10;The semiclassical Hamiltonian given in&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:SemiclassicalHamiltonian\]) can be seen as an approximation&#10;resulting from an underlying fully quantum Hamiltonian that treats both&#10;the driven two-level system and the driving field quantum mechanically.&#10;That underlying Hamiltonian is the Jaynes-Cummunigs (JC) Hamiltonian ,&#10;which is also known as the Rabi-model Hamiltonian: where now is the&#10;frequency of a quantum harmonic oscillator (to which we shall also refer&#10;as the cavity whose excitations are photons) with annihilation and&#10;creation operators and , and is the qubit-cavity coupling strength. It&#10;should be noted that the signs in this Hamiltonian were chosen such that&#10;they have a simple correspondence with those in&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:SemiclassicalHamiltonian\]) and that our results do not depend&#10;on this particular choice.

<outline text="Resonant driving or coupling in the weak limit" _note="First let us consider the simple case of weak driving, which is the case&#10;studied by Rabi in Ref. . If we set (where ) and we assume that the&#10;driving is weak (i.e. ), we find that the two-level quantum system&#10;undergoes Rabi oscillations with frequency , where .&#10;&#10;Similarly we can take the JC Hamiltonian in the case , and with a simple&#10;rotation of qubit reference frame write it as The weak-coupling regime&#10;in this model is given by the condition . In this section, as well as in&#10;parts of the following sections, we assume that the system is in the&#10;weak-coupling regime. In this regime the part of the coupling term in&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:QuantumHamiltonianRotated\]) that contains does not affect the&#10;eigenvalues or eigenstates of the Hamiltonian to the lowest order that&#10;we need here, and it can be ignored. Ignoring it yields the Hamiltonian:&#10;where . The angle here is defined exactly as in the semiclassical case&#10;described in the previous paragraph. For small , we can further ignore&#10;the so-called counter-rotating terms and obtain the approximation where&#10;and the effect of these operators is to excite or de-excite the qubit:&#10;and where and are the ground and excited states of the the bare qubit&#10;Hamiltonian (i.e. ).&#10;&#10;The ground state of the Hamiltonian in&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:QuantumHamiltonianRWA\]) is given by , where the first and&#10;second indices specify, respectively, the state of the qubit and the&#10;number of excitations in the oscillator. Apart from the ground state,&#10;the low energy levels are grouped into pairs with energies above the&#10;ground state energy, with corresponding eigenstates given by . The fact&#10;that the energy eigenstates are quantum superpositions of this form&#10;naturally leads to Rabi-like oscillations. If, for example, the system&#10;is initially set in a state with the qubit in its ground state and the&#10;cavity in a state with photons, and hence the combined system is&#10;initially in the state , the system will undergo oscillations between&#10;the states and with frequency .&#10;&#10;Obviously the two descriptions above, with oscillation frequencies given&#10;by and , are essentially equivalent and give the same value for the Rabi&#10;frequency when we set .">

<outline text="Strong driving" _note="We now turn to the case of strong driving. We start with the&#10;semiclassical model. When we set with , we obtain Rabi oscillations with&#10;frequency where is the -th order Bessel function of the first kind .&#10;This behaviour was observed recently using superconducting qubits . Note&#10;that although Eq. (\[Eq:RabiFrequencySemiclassical\]) does not contain&#10;explicitly, this parameter is of course crucial in determining that the&#10;driving is resonant and therefore in determining the value of . Note&#10;also that here we consider only the case where the resonance condition&#10;is satisfied, because this is the case when the qubit exhibits the&#10;characteristic LZS-Rabi oscillation dynamics .&#10;&#10;If we want to investigate the same situation in the fully quantum&#10;picture, we can start by writing the Hamiltonian in the form where which&#10;leads to the generalized rotating-wave approximation described in Ref. .&#10;The eigenstates of are given by with respective energies . Here the&#10;displacement operator , and we have used the state definitions and .&#10;When , the Hamiltonian has degeneracies between the states and . These&#10;degeneracies are lifted by with the splittings, and hence Rabi&#10;oscillation frequencies, given by where are associated Laguerre&#10;polynomials.&#10;&#10;We can now compare the predictions of the semiclassical and quantum&#10;models by comparing the two expressions given in&#10;Eqs. (\[Eq:RabiFrequencySemiclassical\]) and&#10;(\[Eq:RabiFrequencyQuantum\]). An important point to note here is that,&#10;because of the relation in&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:SemiclassicalQuantumFieldCorrespondence\]), there are two ways&#10;to obtain a large effective driving field in the quantum model, namely&#10;by having a large value of either or such that their product is&#10;comparable to or larger than .&#10;&#10;We start with the case of weak coupling between the qubit and the cavity&#10;(i.e. ), where strong driving would require a large value of . In&#10;Fig. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyWeakCoupling\] we plot the Rabi frequency as&#10;obtained from the semiclassical and fully quantum calculations for for&#10;the four cases and 5. In fact in some recent studies, e.g. Refs. , the&#10;value has been identified as being in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of&#10;the Rabi model. However, for purposes of this study this value of can be&#10;considered to lie in the weak-coupling regime because it leads to the&#10;same behaviour as what we would obtain for very small values of . We can&#10;see from Fig. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyWeakCoupling\] that there is excellent&#10;agreement between the semiclassical and quantum models in their&#10;prediction of the Rabi frequency for all values of , at least up to .&#10;&#10;Next we consider the case of strong coupling between the cavity and the&#10;qubit, and we set . This value corresponds to the so-called&#10;deep-strong-coupling regime of the Rabi model . The two expressions for&#10;the Rabi frequency are plotted in&#10;Fig. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyIntermediateCoupling\]. The two expressions&#10;agree at large values of , but we now see clear deviations at small&#10;values of . The deviations also extend to larger values of with&#10;increasing values of . For example, for the two expressions start to&#10;agree very well when , whereas we need for . Furthermore, below it seems&#10;that the two calculations sometimes give completely different results.&#10;&#10;If we push the qubit-cavity coupling strength to even larger values,&#10;specifically in Fig. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyStrongCoupling\], then even for&#10;the two expressions for the Rabi frequency start to agree only when (not&#10;shown in the figure). One interesting feature that we can see in&#10;Fig. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyStrongCoupling\] is that for and small the&#10;expression derived from the quantum model is essentially zero, while the&#10;semiclassical derivation gives a finite value for the Rabi frequency.&#10;&#10;A conclusion that we can draw from&#10;Figs. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyWeakCoupling\]-\[Fig:RabiFrequencyStrongCoupling\]&#10;is that the semiclassical and quantum models give the same results for&#10;the Rabi frequency in the limits of small and large . Based on this&#10;observation, we can use Eqs. (\[Eq:RabiFrequencySemiclassical\]) and&#10;(\[Eq:RabiFrequencyQuantum\]) to deduce the approximation which is valid&#10;for small and/or large . It is interesting that considering the same&#10;physical problem from two different perspectives has led us to infer a&#10;relationship between two mathematical functions that are not obviously&#10;related. A similar situation is also given in the appendix.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting here that recently an expression containing two&#10;Bessel functions was derived for the Rabi frequency in the case of and .&#10;It is not obvious how this expression can be derived from the quantum&#10;model.&#10;&#10;When considering the dynamics in the fully quantum picture, it is also&#10;interesting to consider the back-action of the qubit on the driving&#10;field. In the semiclassical picture, the field is an externally given&#10;function of time that is not affected by the state of the driven system.&#10;In the quantum picture, any change in the state of the qubit will be&#10;accompanied by a change in the state of the cavity. For example, the&#10;excitation of the qubit from the ground to the excited state in a&#10;-photon resonance will be accompanied by the absorption of photons from&#10;the cavity. The alert reader might have already noticed that the&#10;expression that we used for the semiclassical model contains the photon&#10;number , even though the oscillations involve alternation between and&#10;photons. Taking this point into consideration, one might think that it&#10;would be better to set the classical field to instead of . A closer&#10;inspection of the functions plotted in&#10;Figs. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyWeakCoupling\]-\[Fig:RabiFrequencyStrongCoupling\]&#10;reveals that the situation is somewhat more complicated. For , taking&#10;large values of we find that we obtain the closest agreement between the&#10;semiclassical and quantum calculations by setting for all four values of&#10;plotted in Fig. \[Fig:RabiFrequencyWeakCoupling\]. The term is therefore&#10;consistently there. However, we also have the additional 0.5 whose&#10;origin is not clear. From fitting the data for all the combinations of&#10;and we consistently find that the best agreement is obtained when we set&#10;. We do not know the origin of the last two terms inside the&#10;square-root. We also note that for small values of this formula gave&#10;good agreement for small values of , but deviations between the two&#10;expressions persisted, especially for , where no value of the shift&#10;seemed to consistently reduce the deviations.&#10;&#10;Another back-action effect arises naturally if for a moment we consider&#10;what happens when we choose parameters that do not satisfy resonance&#10;conditions. In this case the energy eigenstates are divided into two&#10;groups corresponding to the qubit states and , as described by&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:GRWABasisStates\]). The cavity part of each one of these&#10;energy eigenstate is described by a Fock state, just as in an isolated&#10;harmonic oscillator, but with a qubit-state-dependent displacement. If&#10;the qubit is prepared in one of the states and and the cavity is&#10;initially prepared in a coherent state, then the cavity field will&#10;undergo oscillations with frequency about a qubit-state-dependent&#10;equilibrium point that is shifted from the origin by . Even if we choose&#10;parameters that satisfy a resonance condition, these oscillations will&#10;occur on short timescales. On longer timescales, specifically the&#10;timescale of Rabi oscillations, the qubit will undergo oscillations&#10;between the states and , and the cavity field will adjust its&#10;oscillation pattern such that it remains correlated with the qubit’s&#10;state. For example, after a full transfer of probability from the state&#10;to the state or vice versa the cavity field will have shifted the origin&#10;of its oscillations by . As discussed above, the amplitude of the cavity&#10;field oscillations will also change because of the absorption or&#10;emission of photons in a -photon resonance.">

<outline text="Time-domain simulations" _note="We now present the results of simulations where we solve the Schrödinger&#10;equation and obtain the qubit state populations as functions of time in&#10;the semiclassical and fully quantum models. We take the case of&#10;two-photon resonance . We choose a driving amplitude (or an equivalent&#10;value of in the quantum model), which gives constructive interference&#10;and therefore a reasonably high Rabi frequency. For the qubit gap we&#10;choose the value , which is relatively large and clearly shows the&#10;step-like dynamics that is one of the characteristics of LZS&#10;interferometry .&#10;&#10;The results of the simulations are plotted in&#10;Fig. \[Fig:TimeDomainDynamics\]. When we use the quantum model with a&#10;coherent state that contains 1000 photons, the results of the quantum&#10;model are almost indistinguishable from those of the semiclassical&#10;model. When we extend the simulations to longer timescales, we see a&#10;decay in the oscillations with a decay time of . This value for the&#10;decay time is rather large considering that the quantum fluctuations in&#10;in such a coherent state are , which is about 3% of the mean photon&#10;number. The reason for this weak decay is that the point is very close&#10;to a maximum in and fluctuations up to 3% in do not result in large&#10;fluctuations in .&#10;&#10;When we change the parameters such that we now have 100 photons in the&#10;coherent state, we see very fast decay in the oscillations, with a decay&#10;time of only a few times the Rabi oscillation period. The quantum&#10;fluctuations in are now on the order of 10%, which means that the Rabi&#10;frequency varies significantly for the different Fock states that make&#10;up this coherent state. Interestingly, if we use a Fock state with&#10;exactly 100 photons and the coupling strength adjusted to the&#10;appropriate value, we recover decay-less oscillations with a frequency&#10;that is essentially identical to that obtained from the semiclassical&#10;calculation. This result is somewhat surprising, because coherent states&#10;are generally expected to give the closest similarity to classical&#10;fields.&#10;&#10;When we reduce the average number of photons in the coherent state to&#10;10, the decay becomes so fast that we can barely see the Rabi&#10;oscillations, and instead of the step-like dynamics that is&#10;characteristic of LZS interferometry we now see only a few frequency&#10;components in the dynamics.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="We have treated the problem of Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg interferometry&#10;when the driving field is in the quantum regime. We have found that the&#10;quantum treatment reproduces the results of the semiclassical treatment&#10;when the qubit-cavity coupling strength is small or the number of&#10;photons in the cavity is large. In this case the expressions containing&#10;Laguerre polynomials that are typical in the study of the Rabi model&#10;coincide with the expressions that contain Bessel functions and are&#10;typical in strong-driving problems. The semiclassical expression is no&#10;longer applicable, however, for large values of and small values of . In&#10;this case, not only do quantum fluctuations cause decaying oscillations&#10;in the time-domain, but the dependence of the Rabi frequency itself&#10;shows differences in the predictions of the two models.&#10;&#10;In our simulations of the Rabi model we have relied on numerical&#10;diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. It should be noted that the recent&#10;advances made on the integrability and solution of the Rabi model&#10;provide additional analytical tools and allow the simulation of very&#10;large system using reasonable computational resources . These new tools&#10;might be useful for treating problems similar to the ones considered&#10;here. For example, the new techniques developed in Refs.  could make it&#10;possible to analyze the case of slow-passage LZS interferometry, which&#10;would correspond to very small values of and is therefore challenging&#10;for us to treat using our numerical approach.&#10;&#10;As there is continuing effort to increase the coupling strength in&#10;cavity-QED systems with remarkable recent progress and as driving&#10;quantum systems with oscillating fields is one of the main tools of&#10;quantum control, we expect that the present study combining these two&#10;important problems will be relevant to future studies that push the&#10;limits of Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg interferometry and cavity QED.&#10;&#10;We would like to thank S. Shevchenko for useful discussions.">

<outline text="Appendix A: Approximation for Bessel functions obtained from LZS interferometry" _note="In this appendix we describe an approximation for Bessel functions that&#10;arises naturally from analyzing the problem of LZS interferometry.&#10;&#10;As mentioned in the main text, the Rabi frequency when strongly driving&#10;a -photon resonance with is given by This expression is expected to be&#10;valid for all values of . There is a well-known approximation for the&#10;Bessel function that is valid in the limit , namely which gives the&#10;approximation&#10;&#10;Using a calculation based on the adiabatic-impulse picture, where one&#10;constructs the dynamics using well-known expressions for the mixing of&#10;probability amplitudes at avoided crossings and the accumulation of&#10;phases away from avoided crossings, Ref.  derived an expression for the&#10;Rabi frequency that is valid in the limit and :&#10;&#10;where we have used the -photon resonance condition . This expression&#10;differs from the one given in&#10;Eq. (\[Eq:RabiFrequencyWithBesselFunctionApproximation\]) by the fact&#10;that instead of we now have and we now have the arccosine function for&#10;one of the phases inside the cosine. These differences disappear when we&#10;take the limit . However, the expression derived using the&#10;adiabatic-impulse method does not require the condition , but rather the&#10;less stringent condition . As a result, the expression should remain&#10;valid even away from the limit . By comparing&#10;Eqs. (\[Eq:RabiFrequencyAsBesselFunction\]) and&#10;(\[Eq:RabiFrequencyFromAdiabaticImpulseMethod\]) we can deduce the&#10;approximation This approximation should remain valid as long as , which&#10;is less stringent than the condition required for the standard&#10;approximation for the Bessel function. Using numerical calculations we&#10;have verified that this is indeed the case. In fact, we find that the&#10;approximation is very good almost down to the point .&#10;&#10;We also find that the further approximation where we expand each term&#10;inside the cosine function to next-to-leading order in , i.e. is a good&#10;approximation almost down to for .&#10;&#10;We have therefore derived a mathematical relation by looking at a&#10;physical problem from two different perspectives.&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;S.
