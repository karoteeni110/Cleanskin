    <title>Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and Primordial Gravity Waves</title>
    <abstract>We examine the effect of the stress tensor of a quantum matter field,
such as the electromagnetic field, on the spectrum of primordial gravity
waves expected in inflationary cosmology. We find that the net effect is
a small reduction in the power spectrum, especially at higher
frequencies, but which has a different form from that described by the
usual spectral index. Thus this effect has a characteristic signature,
and is in principle observable. The net effect is a sum of two
contributions, one of which is due to quantum fluctuations of the matter
field stress tensor. The other is a quantum correction to the graviton
field due to coupling to the expectation value of this stress tensor.
Both contributions are sensitive to initial conditions in the very early
universe, so this effect has the potential to act as a probe of these
initial conditions. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The possible roles of quantum stress tensor fluctuations of a conformal&#10;matter field in inflationary cosmology were explored in Refs. . The&#10;basic hypothesis is that vacuum fluctuations of the energy density, or&#10;other stress tensor components, during inflation can lead to additional&#10;density or tensor perturbations beyond those due to the nearly Gaussian&#10;fluctuations of the inflaton or graviton fields, which are the dominant&#10;source of perturbations in inflationary models. One of the usual&#10;features of inflationary models is the relative lack of dependence upon&#10;initial conditions. This arises because adequate inflationary expansion&#10;will redshift and dilute pre-existing matter, so a generic quantum state&#10;tends eventually to become indistinguishable from the Bunch-Davies&#10;vacuum of de Sitter spacetime. However, the effects of quantum stress&#10;tensor fluctuations exhibit a strong dependence upon the initial&#10;conditions, and tend to grow with increasing duration of the&#10;inflationary expansion. In particular, the contributions to the density&#10;perturbations  and the tensor perturbations  are proportional to the&#10;scale factor change between an initial time and the end of inflation. At&#10;first sight, this violates Weinberg’s theorem , which states that loop&#10;corrections can grow at most logarithmically in the scale factor during&#10;inflation. However, a more careful analysis shows that there is in fact&#10;no contradiction. One picks a perturbation with a given wavelength at&#10;the present time, and then traces it back to the initial time, when it&#10;becomes a perturbations with very short wavelength, which is inversely&#10;proportional to the scale factor change during inflation. However, the&#10;magnitude of stress tensor fluctuation effects increases as the relevant&#10;length scale decreases. The stress tensor fluctuation contribution can&#10;typically be written as a double integral over conformal time of the&#10;stress tensor correlation function. Thus, increasing the duration of&#10;inflation leads to increasing values of the integrals of the stress&#10;tensor correlation function, because shorter proper wavelength modes are&#10;giving the dominant contribution, not because anything is accumulating&#10;as inflation progresses. Another way of saying this, is that the the&#10;dominant contribution is always large, but is not growing in time. Thus,&#10;it is misleading to refer to these contributions as “secular terms&quot;.&#10;&#10;The main purpose of the present paper is to perform a more careful&#10;analysis of the tensor perturbations due to stress tensor fluctuations&#10;which was begun in Ref. . The analysis in this reference was criticized&#10;by Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{} , who noted correctly that an important&#10;contribution was omitted. In addition to the passive fluctuations of the&#10;graviton field due to stress tensor fluctuations, there is also a&#10;correction to the active fluctuations of the graviton field which is of&#10;the same order. Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{} propose a method for calculating&#10;the combined effect of both contributions which leads to a result which&#10;does not depend upon the duration of inflation, and infer that the two&#10;contributions have cancelled one another. In the present paper, we&#10;propose a rather different approach in which each contribution is&#10;computed separately, with initial conditions imposed by a switching&#10;function. This function describes the switch-on of the coupling of the&#10;matter stress tensor with the graviton field. We do not find&#10;cancellation between the passive and active fluctuation effects, but&#10;rather a nonzero one loop correction to the graviton power spectrum.&#10;&#10;The outline of the paper is as follows: Section \[sec:switch\] will&#10;discuss averaging of quantum fields with switching functions of time.&#10;Section \[S:free-gravitons\] will review free gravitons in an expanding&#10;universe, and Sec. \[sec:matter\] will introduce some formalism for&#10;describing the effects of a quantum matter field. Section \[S:P22\] will&#10;compute the correction to the graviton power spectrum coming from matter&#10;stress tensor fluctuations. These are the passive fluctuations of&#10;gravity driven by the fluctuating stress tensor. The part of the power&#10;spectrum coming from loop corrections to the graviton field, the&#10;modified active fluctuations, is treated in Sec. \[S:P13\]. The&#10;combination of both effects is discussed in Sec. \[S:combined\], and&#10;shown in our approach to be nonzero, and dependent upon the details of&#10;the switching function. In general, it has the effect of slightly&#10;reducing the overall power spectrum. Some numerical estimates, and the&#10;possibility of observing this reduction will be discussed. Our results&#10;will be summarized and discussed in Sec. \[S:sum\].">

<outline text="Switching Functions in Quantum Field Theory" _note="In interacting quantum field theory calculations of scattering&#10;amplitudes, it is common to appeal to adiabatic switching of the&#10;coupling constants of the theory. This allows the theory to be&#10;non-interacting in the past and in the future, and allows a well defined&#10;-matrix to connect the asymptotic states. Here the term “adiabatic&quot;&#10;means that the scale of any time dependence in the coupling constants is&#10;long compared to any other time scales in the theory. The details of the&#10;time dependence usually need not be specified.&#10;&#10;There is a different type of switching required in treatments of the&#10;fluctuations of quantum stress tensor operator. The fluctuations of a&#10;local field operator are not defined, as the moments of such an operator&#10;will diverge if they are not zero. However, the time average or&#10;spacetime average of a local stress tensor operator does have finite&#10;moments, and can have a meaningful probability distribution in a given&#10;quantum state, as discussed in Refs. . Here we briefly review the basic&#10;ideas, and describe the role which they will play in the present paper.&#10;Let be a stress tensor operator component, such as energy density, which&#10;has been renormalized to have finite expectation values. In Minkowski&#10;spacetime, this means a normal ordered operator. In curved spacetime, it&#10;means an operator which has been regulated and renormalized, as will be&#10;reviewed in Sec. \[sec:matter\]. Although the local operator may have&#10;finite expectation values in physically realizable states, its&#10;fluctuations are not well defined because its higher moments, for&#10;typically diverge. The physical implication of this divergence is that&#10;the fluctuations of a local operator, such as energy density at a single&#10;spacetime point are infinite and hence not meaningful. However, if we&#10;average over a finite time or spacetime interval, then the fluctuations&#10;do become well defined.&#10;&#10;Let be the average of at a given spatial point with respect to a smooth&#10;() switching function , which satisfies for . Now the moments of become&#10;finite, and a meaningful probability distribution may be defined . The&#10;effect of the time averaging described by , is to suppress the&#10;contribution of high frequency modes to the moments. Averaging in space&#10;alone at a single time is not adequate to produce this suppression, but&#10;averaging in both space and time has qualitatively the same effect as&#10;does time averaging alone. One may view the averaging of a stress tensor&#10;operator as describing its measurement process in a given physical&#10;situation, where the details of the situation define the switching&#10;function. An example of this was discussed in Ref. , which treats the&#10;effects of vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations on quantum particles&#10;near a potential barrier. Here the duration of the switching is taken to&#10;be determined by the time which the particle spends in the vicinity of&#10;the barrier, and the form of the switching function to be defined by the&#10;shapes of both the barrier and the wavepacket of the particle. Similar&#10;ideas were applied in Ref.  to the fluctuations of the quantized&#10;electric field. Most of the above discussion of averaged stress tensor&#10;operators, which are quadratic in the quantum field operator, applies to&#10;linear quantum fields, such as the electric field. The primary&#10;difference is that the stress tensor probability distribution is&#10;sensitive to the functional form of the switching function, whereas the&#10;probability distribution for the electric field is always a Gaussian,&#10;and depends primarily upon the width of the switching interval. In&#10;Ref. , it was shown that if this switching time is taken to be the time&#10;which a charged particle spends in the vicinity of a potential barrier,&#10;then the resulting electric field fluctuations produce a change in the&#10;scattering amplitude which approximately agrees with that given by the&#10;one loop vertex correction to the scattering amplitude. This agreement&#10;supports the hypothesis that the details of a given physical situation&#10;can define the appropriate switching function.&#10;&#10;In the present paper, we are concerned with the coupling of a quantized&#10;matter field stress tensor with gravity, specifically with the tensor&#10;perturbation of an expanding universe. This coupling is mediated by&#10;Newton’s constant, which will be assumed to be time-dependent in the&#10;early universe. This time-dependence produces both of the types of&#10;switching discussed above, the switching of the coupling constant of the&#10;theory, and time-averaging of the quantum stress tensor operator. The&#10;functional form of the switching and its physical origin are not&#10;specified, but assumed to arise from some processes in the early&#10;universe which are not yet understood. Several specific choices will be&#10;explored in Sec. \[sec:choices\].">

Let the&#10;perturbed metric tensor be where the background metric, Eq. , is and is&#10;the perturbation. We may impose the transverse, trace-free (TT) gauge&#10;conditions which reduce the metric perturbations to two transverse&#10;physical degrees of freedom, corresponding to the polarizations of the&#10;gravitational wave. Here the semicolon denotes the covariant&#10;differentiation with respect to the background metric , and is the&#10;four-velocity of a comoving observer.&#10;&#10;It was shown by Lifshitz  that in the absence of sources, the mixed&#10;tensor of the metric perturbation in this gauge satisfies the scalar&#10;wave equation in the spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe, where the&#10;scalar wave operator in the metric Eq.  takes the form with denoting the&#10;determinant of the background metric . This implies that gravitational&#10;waves behave like a pair of free minimally coupled massless scalar&#10;fields in the the spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe .

The factor of in arises&#10;because the effective energy momentum tensor for gravitons is quadratic&#10;in and proportional to . (See the discussion in Sec. \[S:pert\].) In&#10;addition, we require that the zero point energy of a given graviton&#10;mode, which is an integral of the effective energy momentum tensor, have&#10;its usual form of one-half of the angular frequency of the mode, which&#10;is independent of .&#10;&#10;The above mode expansion defines a vacuum state by , for all and .&#10;However, this vacuum state is not uniquely defined, as there are an&#10;infinite set of mode functions which satisfy both Eqs.  and .

The Bunch-Davies vacuum arises when and . For&#10;massive or nonminimally coupled scalar fields, the Bunch-Davies vacuum&#10;is also the de Sitter invariant vacuum state. It is an attractor state&#10;in the sense that inflation redshifts the particle content of other&#10;states, and causes them to approach the Bunch-Davies vacuum. However,&#10;the Bunch-Davies vacuum does not exist in a strict sense for massless,&#10;minimally coupled scalar field or for the graviton field.

<outline text="Effects of a Quantum Matter Field" _note="So far, we have been concerned with free gravitons propagating on a&#10;cosmological background spacetime. Now we wish to introduce quantized&#10;matter, which we take to be a conformal field, such as the&#10;electromagnetic field, with stress tensor operator . As is well-known,&#10;the expectation value of this operator in any quantum state is formally&#10;divergent, and needs to be regularized and renormalized by four&#10;counterterms in the Einstein equations . Two of these counterterms&#10;renormalize the cosmological constant and Newton’s constant,&#10;respectively. The second two counterterms are associated with two&#10;counterterms in the gravitational action which are quadratic in the&#10;curvature. These may be taken to be the square of the scalar curvature&#10;and of the Weyl tensor. After renormalization, may contain contributions&#10;from each of the tensors associated with each counterterm.

  <outline text="Switching in Comoving Time" _note="It has been convenient in much of our analysis to use the conformal time&#10;as the time coordinate. However, the proper time for comoving observers&#10;is , the comoving time. During inflation, when , these time coordinates&#10;are related by Let inflation end at , or . If the universe expands by a&#10;factor of , then inflation begins at about , but at , a very large range&#10;of conformal time corresponds to a much smaller range of comoving time.&#10;In addition, much of the initial change in corresponds to a small&#10;fraction of the change in . Let be when roughly one-half of the total&#10;conformal time interval has elapsed, and let be the corresponding&#10;comoving time. The elapsed comoving time interval is . Thus, regardless&#10;of the size of , the first one-half of the total conformal time&#10;corresponds to less than one e-fold time in comoving time.&#10;&#10;The implication is that apparently slow switching in conformal time is&#10;relatively rapid switching in comoving time.

<outline text="Summary and Discussion" _note="In this paper, we have examined quantum corrections to the tensor power&#10;spectrum in inflationary models. The corrections with which we are&#10;concerned come from the coupling of gravitons to a conformal matter&#10;field, which we take to be the electromagnetic field. There are two&#10;distinct corrections to the power spectrum. One is , which arises from&#10;vacuum stress tensor fluctuations of the matter field. One can view this&#10;contribution as being the gravity waves radiated by the fluctuating&#10;stress tensor, or equivalently, the passive fluctuations of the&#10;gravitational field driven by the quantum stress tensor fluctuations.&#10;The other contribution is , which arises from a modification of the&#10;graviton field in de Sitter spacetime, produced by its coupling to the&#10;renormalized expectation value of the matter field. This can be viewed&#10;as a correction to the active fluctuations of the quantized tensor&#10;perturbations of de Sitter spacetime.&#10;&#10;A key feature of our approach is the use of the switching function, .&#10;This function may be viewed as describing a switching of the coupling of&#10;gravity with the matter field through a time-dependent Newton’s&#10;constant. It may also be viewed as a form of time averaging of the&#10;quantum stress tensor operator, which is essential for a meaningful&#10;treatment of quantum stress tensor fluctuations. The viewpoint adopted&#10;in this paper is that this averaging is more than a formal device, and&#10;represents actual physical processes associated with the measurement of&#10;the stress tensor of a quantized field. In the case of cosmology, we&#10;postulate that it describes some physical effects in the early universe.&#10;These effects are presently not well understood and are associated with&#10;a choice of initial conditions.&#10;&#10;We find that combined correction, , depends upon the choice of switching&#10;function. This seems to be required in our approach, because and scale&#10;with different powers of , as discussed at the end of Sec. \[S:P13\].&#10;For all of our explicit choices of , we find , so the effect is a slight&#10;reduction in the tensor power spectrum, compared to the result obtained&#10;from consideration of free gravitons in de Sitter spacetime. We also&#10;find that the magnitude of is proportional to the scale factor change&#10;during inflation. This is not due to growth as inflation progresses, but&#10;rather is due to decreasing proper wavelength of the perturbation at the&#10;initial time, as this time is made earlier. Recall that we consider a&#10;perturbation with given proper wavelength today, so its proper&#10;wavelength at the beginning of inflation depends upon the amount of&#10;subsequent expansion. Furthermore, the dominant contributions to and&#10;come from the beginning of inflation, or the initial switch-on interval,&#10;as evidenced by their growth with increasing , the effective switch-on&#10;time in conformal time. The essential physical reason for this behavior&#10;is that quantum stress tensor fluctuations are greater on smaller length&#10;scales. This introduces a breaking of de Sitter symmetry by the initial&#10;conditions. The situation described here is quite different from the&#10;usual behavior in inflationary models, where classical perturbations of&#10;a given proper wavelength at the beginning of inflation are more&#10;effectively redshifted away by an increasing duration of inflation.&#10;&#10;Our conclusions clearly differ from those of Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{} , who&#10;find no significant dependence of upon the initial conditions. This&#10;seems to be due to physical inequivalence of our approaches. Fr[ö]{}b,&#10;[ET AL.]{}  use a rather formal prescription, which they call an “&#10;prescription&quot; to select a de Sitter invariant state for the coupled&#10;conformal field - gravity system. Our view is that this prescription is&#10;not physically well motivated. In light of the discussion in the&#10;previous paragraph, we argue that one should expect to find the behavior&#10;found in this present paper, as well in Refs. , where the quantum&#10;corrections to the power spectrum depend upon initial conditions.&#10;&#10;Our main result is a small decrease in the power spectrum of tensor&#10;perturbations which has the linear dependence upon given in Eq. . Note&#10;that this has a distinct functional form from the usual spectral tilt&#10;due to weak dependence of upon . The latter effect is due to the&#10;effective value of varying as different length scales leave the horizon&#10;during inflation, which will also be present in our model. This is&#10;usually modeled by a factor of the form , where is the tensor spectral&#10;index. The estimates given in Sec. \[S:estimates\] indicate that the&#10;quantum corrections to the power spectrum are small. However, if they&#10;can be observed, they could lead to insights about the initial&#10;conditions in the early universe.">
