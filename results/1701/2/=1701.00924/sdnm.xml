    <title>Towards a self-consistent dynamical nuclear model</title>
    <abstract>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a powerful and accurate tool
exploited in Nuclear Physics to investigate the ground-state and some
collective properties of nuclei along the whole nuclear chart. Models
based on DFT are, however, not suitable for the description of
single-particle dynamics in nuclei. Following the field theoretical
approach by A. Bohr and B. R. Mottelson to describe nuclear interactions
between single-particle and vibrational degrees of freedom, we have
undertaken important steps to build a microscopic dynamic nuclear model.
In connection to that, one important issue that needs to be better
understood is the renormalization of the effective interaction in the
particle-vibration approach. One possible way to renormalize the
interaction is the so called [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{}. In this
contribution we will implement the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} for the first
time in our model and study its consequences. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In our research group, we are interested in developing a microscopic&#10;nuclear structure model that can be eventually applied also to nuclear&#10;reactions. Such an achievement, would solve a long standing problem in&#10;theoretical nuclear physics .&#10;&#10;We have recently developed two different energy density functionals&#10;(EDFs) based on the Density Functional Theory . In nuclear physics EDFs&#10;are commonly derived in an approximate way from a phenomenological&#10;interaction solved via the Hartree (H) or Hartree-Fock (HF)&#10;approximations . Such type of models are very helpful in understanding&#10;different nuclear properties such as nuclear masses and sizes as well as&#10;the excitation energy of nuclear collective states such as giant&#10;resonances. In the latter case a minimal extension of the theory is&#10;needed. That is, one needs to perturb the ground state density according&#10;to the oscillation mode under study. For that purpose, one may apply the&#10;small amplitude limit of the Time Dependent H or HF approximations&#10;(TDHF) which coincides with the Linear Response Theory (LRT) or the&#10;Random Phase Approximation (RPA) . We have devoted our efforts to the&#10;detailed study of such observables providing, in some cases, a useful&#10;theoretical guidance .&#10;&#10;Approaches to describe the nucleus based on the nucleon-nucleon&#10;interaction in the vacuum are successful in their predictions of some&#10;properties in light and medium mass nuclei but face computational&#10;limitations in the description of heavy systems and high-lying excited&#10;states . Instead, EDFs approaches do not suffer from such a limitation.&#10;Nevertheless, nuclear EDFs based on static effective potentials are not&#10;suitable for the description of single-particle dynamics in nuclei. For&#10;example the fragmentation of single-particle states and their finite&#10;half-life are unequivocal finger prints. Following the field theoretical&#10;approach by A. Bohr and B. R. Mottelson to describe nuclear interactions&#10;between single-particle and vibrational degrees of freedom, we have&#10;undertaken important steps to build a microscopic dynamic nuclear model.&#10;The Milano group has been traditionally working on such an idea via the&#10;implementation of the so called Particle Vibration Coupling (PVC) model&#10;, yet different physical and technical difficulties need to be faced .&#10;One of the most important drawbacks is the correct treatment of the&#10;renormalization of the interaction. By renormalization, we mean to cure&#10;the divergences whenever they appear due to the nature of the effective&#10;interaction employed and/or the determination of the renormalized&#10;parameters consistently with the adopted many-body scheme.&#10;&#10;In more detail, one can solve the nuclear effective Hamiltonian using&#10;perturbation theory up to first order (Hartee-Fock) and find a static&#10;solution where the nuclear field is just an average static field. The&#10;consequence is that nucleons are predicted to be frozen in their quantum&#10;states and single-particle dynamics are, thus, not realistic. To solve&#10;this problem one needs, for example, to go beyond the Hartree-Fock&#10;approximation, that is, up to higher orders in perturbation theory . If&#10;summing up some specific type of diagrams –those supposed to provide the&#10;largest contributions– that correspond to collective low-energy&#10;vibrations, one can recover, ultimately, a PVC model. Our recent efforts&#10;to understand the renormalization problem lay on the bases of a&#10;simplified model that corresponds to the lowest-order approximation on a&#10;perturbation series expansion of a microscopic PVC approach . In other&#10;words, we aim at building a PVC model in a more systematic way than&#10;those adopted so far and that possibly allow us to formally and reliably&#10;treat the renormalization of the interaction vertices at all levels.&#10;&#10;Existing implementations of the PVC approach, based on relativistic and&#10;non-relativistic frameworks are available in the literature . The PVC&#10;approach has been shown to describe to a good extent the width of giant&#10;resonances, not satisfactorily explained within the TDHF, LRT or RPA.&#10;This feature is crucial to reliably estimate the beta-decay half-life of&#10;a nucleus or the branching ratios for or neutron decays . It also allows&#10;for an estimation of the dependence of the effective mass with energy&#10;and momentum , or in other words, for a more realistic optical potential&#10;, the essential ingredient in any nuclear reaction calculation. Based on&#10;such a successful experience, it is timely to continue the efforts of&#10;our group in which both single-particle and vibrational (phonon) degrees&#10;of freedom are taken into account and consistently calculated within the&#10;same microscopic interaction, by overcoming the difficulties related&#10;with the renormalization.&#10;&#10;Our strategy is to work on different fronts in order to tackle the&#10;different problems in both the nuclear effective interactions used and&#10;the many-body techniques employed. As mentioned, one important issue&#10;that needs to be understood and solved is the renormalization of the&#10;effective interaction in approximations beyond EDFs (BEDF). In this&#10;contribution we will implement the so called [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{}[^1]&#10;to our PVC model for the first time. Such a method have been previously&#10;introduced by other groups in order to avoid double counting when going&#10;BEDF. It is, however, not yet demonstrated that such a procedure&#10;properly renormalizes the theory.&#10;&#10;Finally, it is important to mention that all these studies are the&#10;perfect complement to the experimental activities in our group and world&#10;wide. With the advent of new Rare Ion Beam Facilities , the experimental&#10;investigation of proton- and neutron-rich unstable nuclei has become&#10;possible. Nuclear theory should cover and provide reliable predictions&#10;for the properties of this unexplored area of the nuclear chart, not to&#10;mention the relevance of a deep understanding of the structure of new&#10;super-heavy elements .&#10;&#10;[^1]: The subtraction method has been devised as a way to extend the&#10;    stability condition of the RPA equations to theories beyond such an&#10;    approach, e.g., second RPA (SRPA) .">

<outline text="Formalism" _note="In this section, we will briefly describe the bases of our formalism&#10;paying attention to the underlying physical assumptions and refer the&#10;reader to the references herein for technical details.&#10;&#10;In general, the nuclear Hamiltonian can be written as where represents&#10;the kinetic energy and the two-body and three-body –or density dependent&#10;two-body– effective interaction between nucleons. Adding and subtracting&#10;an auxiliary one-body potential allows us to formulate the problem in&#10;terms of a non-interacting part that corresponds to the so called HF&#10;Hamiltonian if the auxiliary potential is defined as the ground state&#10;expectation value of on a Slater determinant, plus that vanishes by&#10;construction within the HF approximation. That is, the solution of&#10;coincides with that of in first order perturbation theory. The&#10;diagrammatic representation for the HF self-energy can be seen in&#10;Fig.\[fig1\]. In what follows, we will denote as the set of occupied and&#10;unoccupied HF states with energy .&#10;&#10;[hf]{}&#10;&#10;(150,75)&#10;&#10;(150,75)&#10;&#10;Considering in higher order perturbation theory, that is, adopting as&#10;the unperturbed Hamiltonian , the contribution of will be exactly zero&#10;in all cases[^1]. Hence, standard perturbation theory techniques can be&#10;applied directly to the potential for higher order calculations.&#10;However, to apply such a strategy is very complicated from the technical&#10;point of view and the implementation of higher order contributions may&#10;not entail, in general, a clear physical interpretation. Alternatively,&#10;one may select the most relevant diagrams that should play a clear&#10;physical role and sum them up to infinite order –if possible. Hence, it&#10;is crucial to understand the relevant degrees of freedom of the problem&#10;under consideration and to connect them with given terms in the&#10;many-body expansion. This is the case of the vibrational degrees of&#10;freedom or phonons in nuclei[^2]. Collective low-energy nuclear&#10;vibrations constitute one of the major actors in generating, when&#10;coupled to single-particle degrees of freedom, the fragmentation of the&#10;latters that give rise to the so called spreading width observed in&#10;nuclei. At larger energies, collective motion in nuclei give rise to a&#10;prominent dynamic effect: giant resonances . They are super-positions of&#10;particle-hole excitations. In particular, phonons are built from a very&#10;specific type of diagram summed up to infinity –this corresponds to&#10;solve the RPA equations. Such a series of diagrams that include a&#10;particle (unoccupied state) hole (occupied state) excitation (1p-1h),&#10;named bubble diagrams, are represented in Fig.\[fig2\].&#10;&#10;[rpa]{} = + + ...&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is customary to work within a subspace that contains all&#10;nuclear 1p-1h configurations built with the single-particle states ,&#10;eigenfunctions of the HF Hamiltonian, where the RPA –in a discrete space&#10;in our case– will correspond to solve the initial Hamiltonian projected&#10;in the subspace . The RPA states built in this way are linear&#10;combinations of 1p-1h (HF) states that represent, as mentioned, a&#10;nuclear vibration or phonon. A discretized RPA calculation may display a&#10;spread of different excitation peaks producing a broadening of a Giant&#10;Resonance at contrast with the ideal situation in which there is a clear&#10;single and collective peak. Such an effect depends on the intensity of&#10;the residual interaction that particle-hole configurations feel as well&#10;as the density of the unperturbed 1p-1h states around a given excitation&#10;energy. This effect is well known in the literature and it is named&#10;Landau damping. In addition, it is worth mentioning that if continuum is&#10;discretized, the RPA states are stationary states with no spreading&#10;width. The reason for this is that the RPA do not introduce an energy&#10;dependence in the self-energy.&#10;&#10;In general, the coupling of nuclear vibrational states with&#10;single-particle states[^3] consents the transfer of energy from one&#10;degree of freedom to another. This allows for the rearrangement of the&#10;internal degrees of freedom giving rise to a damping via the so called&#10;spreading width (). A PVC approach provides also a more realistic&#10;description –when compared to the HF or RPA results– of the emission of&#10;a ray and the escape of nucleons which contribtues to the so called&#10;escape width (). In Fig.\[fig3\] we show the diagrammatic representation&#10;of the terms contributing to the spreading width in the PVC approach.&#10;&#10;[spread]{}&#10;&#10;As in Ref., in order to model the escape and spreading widths, we define&#10;two additional sub-spaces. The first one is made of holes plus unbound&#10;HF states which have positive energy and that we construct to be&#10;orthogonal to the bound occupied and unoccupied HF states by solving for&#10;those additional scattering states labeled as . The second subspace is&#10;made of 1p-1h excitations coupled to a phonon state labeled as . Note&#10;that by construction since will be always zero. Finally, we define the&#10;subspace . The projectors and cover the full model space: and ; and all&#10;the projectors fulfill the usual conditions: , and .&#10;&#10;The Green’s function formalism gives a natural representation of the&#10;response of a quantum mechanical system to a given perturbation. The&#10;dynamical many-body Green’s function of an interacting system described&#10;by a Hamiltonian evaluated at a given energy , is a solution of the&#10;operator equation Within our model, the Green’s function can be split in&#10;different terms using the defined sub-spaces as&#10;&#10;Our interest is to provide a microscopic and realistic description of&#10;the dynamics in nuclei. We therefore choose to project the Hamiltonian&#10;in the subspace taking into account in an approximate way the effects of&#10;the continuum and of more complex configurations .&#10;&#10;Using the properties of the sub-spaces defined here and following a&#10;method very similar to that of Ref., we manipulate Eq.(\[g\]) by first&#10;sandwiching it with , then, similarly, we sandwich it with from the left&#10;and from the right and, finally, with from the left and from the right.&#10;From the last two equations, analogous to Eq.(\[q1\]), we find an&#10;expression for and in terms of that we insert into Eq.(\[q1\]). Putting&#10;all that together one arrives at the expression, where projected in the&#10;subspace is (cf. \[appendix\]) Assuming that continuum states are&#10;unaffected by collective vibrations (see also \[appendix\]), one will&#10;recover the expression in Eq.(24) of Ref.. Such an approximation is&#10;justified as follows. Matrix elements of are expected to be very small&#10;due to the short range of the interaction: the overlapping between&#10;continuum states and bound states or phonon states will occur in space&#10;regions where the former wave functions are small. Therefore, where by&#10;construction. In Eq.(\[hq1.0\]), the first term in the right hand side&#10;of the equation corresponds to the RPA solution, ; the second term&#10;corresponds to excite a bound particle or hole state to the continuum,&#10;its propagation on top of the non-interacting (HF) potential for states&#10;with positive energy and its deexcitation to a bound state again. This&#10;term, commonly labeled as , will produce the escape width previously&#10;discussed. The fourth term corresponds to the coupling of a particle or&#10;hole state with more complex configurations represented by , its&#10;propagation on top of the potential, and the reabsortion of this complex&#10;state into a particle or a hole. This term, commonly labeled as , will&#10;produce the spreading width previously discussed. The last two terms are&#10;higher order contributions to and that account for the effects of&#10;nuclear vibrations into continuum states. Those terms are neglected in&#10;our calculations due to the reasons discussed above.&#10;&#10;Hence, we define within our approximations, For the escape term, within&#10;our previous approximations, one can take advantage of and consistently&#10;employ the Green’s function solution of . Therefore, similar to Eq.(29)&#10;of Ref., one can write it as Provided a sufficiently large basis is&#10;employed, the accuracy of this procedure is comparable with exact&#10;continuum RPA calculations .&#10;&#10;In what follows, we define some useful and related quantities. The&#10;observed spectrum of a nucleus excited by an external field is described&#10;by the nuclear polarization propagator or dynamic polarizability . It&#10;corresponds to the double convolution with of the propagator or response&#10;function, i.e. in our specific case , that is The strength function is&#10;defined as Finally, of special interest are some of the moments of the&#10;strength function since they are subject to fulfill some existing sum&#10;rules. The moment of the strength function is defined as where&#10;corresponds to the so called Non Energy Weighted Sum Rule (NEWSR),&#10;corresponds to the so called Energy Weighted Sum Rule (EWSR) and to the&#10;Inverse Energy Weighted Sum Rule (IEWSR). The latter is proportional to&#10;the static limit of the dynamic polarizability .&#10;&#10;[^1]: This is because in perturbation theory, matrix elements of&#10;    appearing in higher order contributions to the energy or wave&#10;    function can be always written in terms of the unperturbed bases.&#10;&#10;[^2]: Also rotational degrees of freedom play an important role but we&#10;    will not discuss this here.&#10;&#10;[^3]: For consistency within the adopted many-body scheme, it is&#10;    important to note that when coupling a phonon state with a particle&#10;    state the one bubble diagram have to be subtracted from the&#10;    self-energy (see Fig.2 of the same reference). The reason is that&#10;    the RPA phonon contains the contribution of the one bubble diagram.&#10;    Such diagram has two equivalent fermionic lines and, thus, for&#10;    symmetry reasons a factor half has to be taken into account. The way&#10;    of implementing this symmetry is just by subtracting the one bubble&#10;    diagram. The latter considerations do not apply for higher order&#10;    bubble diagramms.">
  <outline text="The subtraction method" _note="Commonly in nuclear physics, the determination of EDF parameters is done&#10;at the H or HF levels as previously explained. Obviously, effective&#10;theories that go beyond the H or HF approaches should be refitted to&#10;experimental data in order to avoid double-counting. That is, a&#10;renormalization of the model parameters is compulsory with respect to&#10;those determined within the H or HF approaches. The parameters will&#10;change their value since physical many-body terms beyond the H or HF&#10;approximations are now explicitly included. The purpose of the&#10;[SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} is to provide a recipe for the renormalization of&#10;the effective interaction within the adopted model scheme that avoids a&#10;refitting of the parameters. We will see that such a method is suitable&#10;to renormalize the expectation value of one body operators only.&#10;Therefore, if this is equal to –or one proper way to– a refit of the&#10;interaction, is a question that would depend on the nature of the&#10;studied (fitted) observables. Another related but different issue is the&#10;renormalization of the divergences that appear in BEDF theories when&#10;zero-range effective interactions are adopted (see for example and&#10;Sec.\[reno\] below).&#10;&#10;Apart from the renormalization of the interaction, the [SUBTRACTION&#10;METHOD]{} proposed in Ref. has been devised to keep the stability&#10;condition of an RPA-like matrix when going beyond the RPA. This should&#10;be one of the most important points to justify such a procedure. The&#10;stability condition guarantees real eigenvalues and implies that the&#10;Slater determinant on which the RPA-like matrices are based must be a&#10;minimum of the energy. On this regard, we note that our theoretical&#10;method allows us to write the equations to be solved as an energy&#10;dependent RPA-like matrix (cf. Eq.(2.5) in Ref.).&#10;&#10;In what follows, we review the underlying idea of the [SUBTRACTION&#10;METHOD]{}. For technical details we refer the reader to the original&#10;reference . In general, the dynamic polarizability follows the equation&#10;where represents in general an induced effective interaction and the&#10;dynamic polarizability at the level of approximation that one wants to&#10;improve. That is, if the RPA approach is adopted (see Fig.\[fig2\]), and&#10;is the so called particle-hole (or residual) interaction that is defined&#10;as where represents the EDF of choice.&#10;&#10;Now, assuming that we are dealing with the exact nuclear EDF and that it&#10;can be derived from a Hamiltonian, DFT ensures that will also describe&#10;exactly the ground state of the perturbed system if is a one-body&#10;operator. Such an observation implies that the expectation value of any&#10;one-body operator calculated using the ground-state wave function&#10;solution of the constrained calculation, i.e. solution of , is also&#10;exact. Via the dielectric theorem , which establishes that , one should&#10;conclude that should be conserved in BEDF calculations as compared to&#10;its value calculated within the exact EDF. In this case, it is shown&#10;that should be conserved but it might be that other features related to&#10;the response function require the same treatment.&#10;&#10;One of the possible realizations that conserve the value of in BEDF&#10;approaches is as suggested in . In this reference it is shown that&#10;recovering the static limit of the dynamic polarizability is equivalent&#10;to recover the RPA response function in BEDF approaches. This would&#10;imply in practice to modify Eq.(\[prop\]) as follows: since now it is&#10;ensured that and, therefore, (cf. Eq.\[resp\]). In our specific case,&#10;the induced effective interaction will be .&#10;&#10;Hence, the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} directly impacts on many properties of&#10;excited modes in nuclei althought it should restore the EDF values for&#10;the expectation value of one-body operators due to the redefinition&#10;(renormalization) of . Therefore, to study how such a method performs in&#10;practice for those cases in which we know that the result should be&#10;conserved in BEDF calculations with respect EDF calculations is of&#10;prominent importance.">

  <outline text="Sum rules" _note="The Thouless theorem states that the EWSR calculated within the RPA&#10;approach is equal to the HF expectation value of the double commutator ,&#10;where represents the external field that perturbs the nuclear ground&#10;state. In Ref. it was proven that the EWSR in second RPA (SRPA) is also&#10;equal to the double commutator calculated within the HF ground state&#10;and, therefore, also to the RPA value. Such a result was derived without&#10;implementing the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{}. Actually, this proof is valid&#10;for both the full SRPA and SRPA calculations where the 2-2 subspace has&#10;been eliminated by introducing an energy dependent effective interaction&#10;in the 1-1 subspace (see below). As a matter of fact, RPA as well as the&#10;latter proof are based on the quasiboson approximation, where the&#10;expectation value of the operators are calculated within the&#10;uncorrelated HF ground state instead of the more consistent treatment&#10;that would consider the correlated RPA (or SRPA) ground state . On this&#10;regard, the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} should provide a correlated wave&#10;function for the ground state that should give the same results, when&#10;applied to the calculation of the expectation value of any one body&#10;operator, as the HF expectation value of the same operator. This is&#10;because, the redefinition of the induced effective interaction in the&#10;static limit (). Due to these considerations, when the result of the&#10;double commutator is a one-body operator, the EWSR calculated within the&#10;SRPA –and possibly also the PVC– method with and without subtraction&#10;should not differ much in practice with the RPA result.&#10;&#10;Regarding the IEWSR or static polarizability : from Ref. it is easy to&#10;understand the amount by which should be corrected in SRPA to recover&#10;the same value for the IEWSR found in RPA \[cf. Eq.(2.87)\]. It actually&#10;coincides with the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} of Ref.. An easy way to see&#10;that is as follows. Starting from the (full) SRPA matrix \[see for&#10;example Eq.(2.48) in Ref.\] where 1-1 and 2-2 terms are assumed to&#10;interact, one can easily rearrange rows and columns such that the&#10;resulting matrix separates within different sub-spaces that enclose the&#10;1-1 () and 2-2 () sub-spaces separated in blocks along the diagonal&#10;while outside the diagonal there appear the interaction terms between&#10;both sub-spaces. By using the technique described above , one may&#10;project the original Hamiltonian into the subspace taking into account&#10;the effects of the subspace perturbatively. For that the only assumption&#10;is to neglect the residual interaction in the subspace. Having done&#10;that, the induced effective interaction can be modified by an energy&#10;dependent term The latter correction written within the standard SRPA&#10;matrix formulation can be seen in Eq.(2.69) of Ref.. By inspecting now&#10;the expression for the in SRPA (see also Eq.(2.87) of Ref.) and imposing&#10;that (SRPA)=(RPA) or equivalently =, one easily realizes from&#10;Eq.(\[resp\]) that there is an extra term that one will need to subtract&#10;in order to fulfill the latter equality. Such term actually coincides&#10;with the one proposed by the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{}. Therefore, for&#10;sufficiently weak perturbations, the energy dependent SRPA reduction&#10;from the full SRPA should be accurate and the subtraction method&#10;proposed by Tselyaev should properly work and conserve the value of the&#10;static polarizability in such an extension BEDF.&#10;&#10;We will now analyze and from a different perspective. Consider that the&#10;ground state density is perturbed by an external (one-body) field .&#10;Changes in the expectation value of the Hamiltonian can be written as,&#10;where standard perturbation theory has been applied (i.e. and represents&#10;an excited state and corresponding energy of the system). In other&#10;terms, which is nothing but the dielectric theorem previously&#10;introduced. If we consider the case in which is an isoscalar and&#10;velocity independent operator and define the operator where is the&#10;kinetic energy, we can calculate the change in the expectation value of&#10;the Hamiltonian when perturbed by and find This observation allows one&#10;to state that for some specific operators (excitation modes) [THE&#10;THOULESS THEOREM FOR IS EQUIVALENT TO THE DIELECTRIC THEOREM APPLIED TO&#10;]{}, provided that the corresponding quantities are calculated&#10;consistently within the same approximation. Hence, we see again that&#10;whenever the EWSR of some special excitation modes, should be conserved&#10;when going BEDF. As a final remark, it has been also shown in Ref. that&#10;the NEWSR within the SRPA approach coincides with the same quantity&#10;calculated within the RPA approach whenever a subtraction is not&#10;implemented. To check this feature together with the results for the and&#10;within the PVC approach might shed some light into the connection&#10;between the sum rules calculated at different levels of approximation in&#10;the adopted many-body scheme and on the renormalization of the&#10;particle-vibration approach.">

  <outline text="Ultraviolet divergences" _note="So far, the considerations here do not take into account the&#10;renormalization of the ultraviolate divergences arising from BEDF models&#10;if based on zero-range effective interactions , such as the widely used&#10;Skyrme as well as part of the Gogny interaction or the so-called&#10;point-coupling relativistic models . Interestingly, ultraviolate&#10;divergences seem to be avoided by the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{}. Hence, in&#10;this context, the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} can be regarded as a practical&#10;recipe that should be employed with caution since it is yet to be&#10;demonstrated that it propely renormalizes the theory. The reabsortion of&#10;the ultraviolate divergence by the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} is as follows.&#10;In general, one can write in second order perturbation theory where 1&#10;and 2 indicate two different nuclear states and is a complete bases of&#10;nuclear intermediate states that connect the initial and final states&#10;via the effective interaction . As it is evident from the last equation,&#10;for the divergence is canceled.">

<outline text="Results" _note="As discussed, one of the important test grounds for the [SUBTRACTION&#10;METHOD]{} is the analysis of some specific sum rules. With the questions&#10;raised in the previous section in mind, we will study the (NEWSR),&#10;(EWSR), (IEWSR) and the centroid energies and for the isoscalar monopole&#10;and quadrupole modes of excitation in the test case of O. This will be&#10;in analogy with Ref. where the same cases have been studied within the&#10;SRPA approach. The selection of these one-body, isoscalar and velocity&#10;independent external fields is motivated by the discussions made in the&#10;previous section in connection with the calculation of and . In order to&#10;assess the systematics on our results, we have adopted three different&#10;non-relativistic effective interactions SLy5 , SkM\* and SAMi of common&#10;use in nuclear physics.&#10;&#10;In addition, we will show our results for the isoscalar monople response&#10;in Pb due to its relevance in the determination of the nuclear matter&#10;incompressibility and of the isoscalar quadrupole response in Pb since&#10;it is connected to the value of the effective mass at the Fermi surface.&#10;We will also comment on our results for the low-lying state in Pb that&#10;has been argued in Ref. not to be strongly affected by complex&#10;configurations such as the coupling to a phonon state.&#10;&#10;The model space in our calculations is defined by a radial mesh of 200&#10;points in steps of 0.1 fm and a maximum particle energy of 80 MeV. We&#10;have checked that doorway phonons of non-natural parity are negligible&#10;for the studied cases and, thus, we only include phonons of natural&#10;parity up to multipolarity equal to 5 with energy less than 30 MeV and&#10;absorbing a fraction of the NEWSR larger than 2%. Such a choice gives&#10;converged results for the different moments of the strength function&#10;studied here. We use a smearing parameter of 250 keV. The full effective&#10;interaction is self-consistently kept in all vertices at all levels of&#10;approximation studied here. Our model has been tested also for the well&#10;known Gamow-Teller resonance without accounting for the subtraction and&#10;contemporarily to our present work in Ref. including the subtraction.">
  <outline text="Sum rules" _note="The EWSR for the isoscalar monopole and quadrupole responses in O has&#10;been seen to change in SRPA calculations with respect to the double&#10;commutator sum rule calculated at the HF level when the subtraction&#10;method is adopted (cf. Fig.13 in Ref.). In the same work the EWSR is&#10;conserved when the subtraction is not implemented. This is in agreement&#10;with Refs., where it was shown that the EWSR is conserved for SRPA&#10;calculations without subtraction. As a matter of fact, the changes&#10;produced by the subtraction method on the prediction of the EWSR in the&#10;SRPA calculations presented in Ref. are not large (10%).&#10;&#10;In Fig.\[fig4\], we show our PVC results for the monopole (upper panels)&#10;and quadrupole (lower panels) response in O as predicted by three Skyrme&#10;interactions: SLy5 (left panels), SkM\* (middle panels) and SAMi (right&#10;panels). In grey bars, the RPA response is depicted. In dashed red lines&#10;PVC results without subtraction and in dash-point lines with subtraction&#10;are shown. For the case of the monopole response, PVC correlations do&#10;not affect qualitatively the strength function in the giant resonance&#10;region and, consistently, the subtraction method has a little impact.&#10;Such a small PVC effect is well understood from theory (see Sec.IV.B in&#10;). The first (second) and third (fourth) diagrams reading from the left&#10;in Fig.\[fig3\] correspond to matrix elements of the type&#10;particle-particle (hole-hole) squared and particle-particle and&#10;hole-hole mixed that differ by a geometrical factor (6- symbol, cf.&#10;Eq.(A12) in Ref.): this matrix elements are essentially equal and with&#10;opposite sign in the case of excitation modes.&#10;&#10;For the quadrupole response instead, we see from Fig. \[fig4\] that the&#10;PVC results qualitatively modify the strength function with respect to&#10;the RPA results by producing a shift in energy of the giant resonance&#10;peak. This is because the real part of the self-energy or, equivalently,&#10;the effective mass has been strongly modified by the PVC . Such a change&#10;is expected since we know that the effective mass () at the Fermi&#10;surface ( where is the bare nucleon mass) is not well described within&#10;EDF models () and it is corrected in the right direction by the PVC&#10;approach . We will come back to this point for the case of Pb.&#10;&#10;The differences on the predicted sum rules for the monopole case can be&#10;clearly seen in Fig.\[fig5\] (and Table \[tab1\]) where cumulative sums&#10;for (upper panels) and (lower panels) are displayed following the same&#10;color and line-type code as in Fig.\[fig4\]. In this figure, it is clear&#10;that the EWSR is recovered within the PVC approach with no subtraction&#10;while PVC results with subtraction slightly overestimate by 6-7% (cf.&#10;Table \[tab1\]). This is in agreement with Ref.. Regarding the IEWSR, it&#10;is increased by 8% in the PVC predictions with no subtraction while it&#10;is almost perfectly restored when the subtraction is implemented in&#10;agreement with what we expected from the previous considerations and&#10;with Ref.. In Table \[tab1\], the converged values for the monopole sum&#10;rules are shown. In addition to the quantitative information discussed&#10;above on these results, we also notice that our RPA results fully&#10;exhaust the double commutator sum rule; that the NEWSR in the PVC&#10;calculations with and without subtraction are (almost) equal to that of&#10;the RPA; that, consequently, the centroid energy is barely shifted by&#10;the PVC calculations without subtraction while it is shifted upwards by&#10;about 5% (1 MeV) if the subtraction is implemented; and that,&#10;consequently, the PVC predictions for the centroid energy show the same&#10;trends although its value is slightly closer to the RPA when the&#10;subtraction is implemeted (2%).&#10;&#10;The differences on the predicted sum rules for the quadrupole case can&#10;be seen instead in Fig.\[fig6\] (and Table \[tab2\]) where cumulative&#10;sums for (upper panels) and (lower panels) are displayed following the&#10;same color and line-type code as in Fig.\[fig4\]. In this figure, it is&#10;clear that the EWSR is recovered within the PVC approach with no&#10;subtraction while PVC results with subtraction slightly overestimate by&#10;3-5% (cf. Table \[tab2\]). This is again in agreement with Refs. and&#10;with our previous discussions. Regarding the IEWSR, it is increased by&#10;16-20% in the PVC predictions with no subtraction while it is only&#10;partially restored within 10% when the subtraction is implemented.&#10;Therefore, the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} in our model does not perfectly&#10;work in this case although the correction is sizeable and in the right&#10;direction. In Table \[tab2\], the converged values for the quadrupole&#10;sum rules are shown. In addition to the quantitative information&#10;discussed above on these results, we should notice that our RPA results&#10;fully exhaust the double commutator sum rule; that the NEWSR in the PVC&#10;calculations with and without subtraction are overestimated by with&#10;respect to the RPA values; and that, consequently, the centroid energies&#10;and are barely shifted by the PVC calculations with subtraction while&#10;they are shifted downwards by about 5-10% ( 2 MeV) if the subtraction is&#10;not implemented. Hence, our results are not conclusive yet although the&#10;[SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} gives reasonable results –within 10% accuracy–&#10;for the studied sum rules. The reason for that discrepancy is actually a&#10;measure of the accuracy of the adopted approximations which are&#10;essentially two: i) the subspace is assumed to be made of&#10;non-interacting states; and ii) we do not correct for the small –but&#10;present– contributions to Eq.(\[sw\]) that violate the Pauli exclusion&#10;principle. Work to solve these issues should be addressed in the future.">

  <outline text="Isoscalar quadrupole response in Pb" _note="Experimentally, the well known state in the low-energy isoscalar&#10;quadrupole response in Pb is at about 4 MeV exhausting a large fraction&#10;of the EWSR while the giant resonance peak is at around 11 MeV and has a&#10;width of about 3 MeV . The high energy peak corresponding to the&#10;isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance is known to be related to the value&#10;of the effective mass in the vicinity of the Fermi surface () .&#10;Specifically, within a simple harmonic oscillator model, one may write&#10;that where is the shell gap. We show in Fig.\[fig7\] the predictions of&#10;our PVC calculations using SLy5. As grey bars we show the RPA response,&#10;in dashed red lines the PVC without subtraction and in dot dashed blue&#10;lines the PVC with subtraction. One black arrow indicates the position&#10;of the measured state and the other black arrow indicates the&#10;experimental centroid energy MeV in the giant resonance region. PVC&#10;calculations show that the energy of the state is affected by more&#10;complex configurations that produce a downshift in energy of about 2 MeV&#10;with respect to the RPA result when the subtraction is not implemented&#10;and it is only slightly shifted when the subtraction is applied giving a&#10;much realistic estimate for such state. In this regard, our results&#10;without subtraction are not satisfactory. Regarding the giant resonance&#10;peak, as it is well known, RPA calculations based on EDF with effective&#10;masses lower than the bare nucleon mass overestimates the excitation&#10;energy. As it is also well known, the PVC approach introduces an energy&#10;dependence also in the real part of the self-energy that corrects the&#10;value of the effective mass such that it is more realistic and compares&#10;better with the empirical value. On this regard, it seems that the&#10;results employing the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} better reproduces the&#10;excitation energy of the giant resonance.">

  <outline text="Isoscalar monopole response in Pb" _note="In Fig.\[fig8\], the isoscalar monopole response in Pb as predicted by&#10;the SAMi interaction is shown. In grey bars we show the RPA response&#10;while in dashed red lines the PVC without subtraction and in dot dashed&#10;blue lines the PVC with subtraction are displayed. A black arrow&#10;indicates the centroid energy MeV measured within 8 and 22 MeV . The&#10;centroid energy defined as the square root of the ratio between the EWSR&#10;and IEWSR is MeV. The width of the resonance has been measured to be&#10;between 2 and 3 MeV approximately (cf. Table 4.1 of Ref.). In our&#10;calculations using SAMi, we find within 8 and 22 MeV that for the RPA&#10;the EWSR is 97%, MeV and MeV; for the PVC without subtraction the EWSR&#10;is 91%, MeV and MeV; and for the PVC with subtraction the EWSR is 91%,&#10;MeV and MeV. The width predicted by our PVC calculations is of 2 MeV.&#10;Thus, SAMi predicts reasonable values for the excitation energy and&#10;width of this resonance both, with and without subtraction, since PVC&#10;effects are small as expected. It is well known within the RPA approach&#10;that the excitation energy of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance and&#10;the finite nucleus incompressibility can be related as follows : where&#10;is the mean squared radius of the nucleus. Hence, our results suggest&#10;that will be barely affected by PVC effects and, then, it should be&#10;reliably derived from EDF models. In the limit of one would recover the&#10;value for the nuclear matter incompressibility, a crucial ingredient of&#10;the nuclear Equation of State that governs physical systems from the&#10;very small: the interior of a nucleus; to the very big: the interior of&#10;a neutron star.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="The PVC approach presents some important points that need to be solved.&#10;In connection to that, one issue that needs to be better understood is&#10;the renormalization of the effective interaction in the&#10;particle-vibration approach. One proposed way to do so is the so called&#10;[SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} . This method ensures that the static limit of&#10;the dynamic polarizability is conserved in BEDF approaches with respect&#10;to the EDF value. In addition, the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} guaranties the&#10;stability condition in RPA-like theories. Both features are very&#10;important. As an example, the static dipole polarizability is being&#10;nowadays extensively studied theoretically on an EDF bases (see and&#10;references therein) and in laboratories such as the RCNP in Japan or GSI&#10;in Germany .&#10;&#10;In this contribution we have implemented the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} for&#10;the first time in our PVC model and studied its suitability on the bases&#10;of existing sum rules applied as an example to the case of O and Pb. We&#10;have found that the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} allows one to (mostly)&#10;recover in the PVC approach the value of predicted at the RPA level but&#10;with some caveats: while this is almost exactly fulfilled in our&#10;calculations of the isoscalar monopole resonance in O, it is just&#10;approximately fulfilled for the case of the isoscalar quadrupole&#10;response in O. These results should be further and systematically&#10;investigated in the future. As discussed, also the and moments of the&#10;strength function have been subject of our studies. This is because&#10;these two quantities have been shown to be conserved by SRPA&#10;calculations with respect to their RPA counterparts when the subtraction&#10;is not implemented . In addition, the moment has been intensively&#10;studied along the years, both experimentally and theoretically . Within&#10;our calculations, the value is exactly conserved at the PVC level with&#10;respect the corresponding RPA results only if the subtraction is not&#10;implemented and slightly overestimated otherwise. The quantities and&#10;have been studied since they constitute one of the possible ways to&#10;extract the excitation energy of a given resonance. Both have been&#10;object of many studies in the past and their study should be revitalized&#10;nowadays with the advent of new Rare Ion Beam facilities that aim at&#10;measuring the excitation properties in exotic nuclei. Regarding the&#10;excitation energy , we have seen that our PVC calculations almost&#10;recover the RPA value when the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} is applied while&#10;it is slightly underestimated otherwise. For the centroid energy , as a&#10;consequence of our previous results, we find that it is conserved for&#10;the monopole if the subtraction is not implemented and for the&#10;quadrupole if the subtraction is implemented.&#10;&#10;We have also presented our results on the isoscalar monopole and&#10;quadrupole responses in Pb and learn that the finite nucleus&#10;incompressibility is barely affected by PVC effects while the effective&#10;mass –as it was well known– is properly corrected in our PVC&#10;calculations. In addition to that we have paid special attention to the&#10;state since it has been argued that it should not be strongly modified&#10;by complex configurations such as the coupling to a phonon state. We&#10;find that this is not the case when the subtraction is not implemented&#10;since the energy of this peak is downshifted by about 2 MeV going far&#10;from the experimental value and that it is just slightly shifted with&#10;respect to the RPA result when the subtraction is applied, the latter&#10;giving a much realistic estimate for such an state.&#10;&#10;As a summary, in all cases the moments and excitation energies agree&#10;within 10% with the RPA results except for the calculation of within our&#10;PVC model without implementing the subtraction. The studied giant&#10;resonances in Pb as well as the state are in reasonable agreement with&#10;experiment by our PVC calculations if the subtraction is implemented.&#10;Our results indicate that the [SUBTRACTION METHOD]{} renormalizes the&#10;particle-vibration approach in the good direction although a better&#10;understanding or strategy is indeed needed on this regard. Further&#10;investigations in connection with the renormalization of the&#10;particle-vibration approach are envisaged.">
