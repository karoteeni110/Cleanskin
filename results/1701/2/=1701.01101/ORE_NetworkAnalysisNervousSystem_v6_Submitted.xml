<outline text="Summary" _note="Network analyses in nervous system disorders involves constructing and&#10;analyzing anatomical and functional brain networks from neuroimaging&#10;data to describe and predict the clinical syndromes that result from&#10;neuropathology. A network view of neurological disease and clinical&#10;syndromes facilitates accurate quantitative characterizations and&#10;mathematical models of complex nervous system disorders with relatively&#10;simple tools drawn from the field of graph theory. Networks are&#10;predominantly constructed from IN VIVO data acquired using physiological&#10;and neuroimaging techniques at the macroscale of nervous system&#10;organization. Studies support the emerging view that neuropsychiatric&#10;and neurological disorders result from pathological processes that&#10;disrupt the brain’s economically wired small-world organization. The&#10;lens of network science offers theoretical insight into progressive&#10;neurodegeneration, neuropsychological dysfunction, and potential&#10;anatomical targets for interventions ranging from pharmacological agents&#10;to brain stimulation.&#10;&#10;**Keywords:** Network science | Neurology | Graph Theory | Connectome |&#10;Neuroimaging">

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Nervous system disorders are characterized by pathological processes in&#10;the brain and peripheral neural tissue that can either be genetic or&#10;acquired. These disorders affect mental function and behavior as a&#10;natural consequence of neural degeneration or damage. The processes and&#10;effects of nervous system disorders are studied by biologists,&#10;psychologists, and clinicians, and also increasingly by individuals with&#10;backgrounds in technical and computational fields. In the neurosciences,&#10;an increasing synthesis between neurological and computational sciences&#10;is redefining how the function and dysfunction of the nervous system is&#10;quantified and treated. One intuitive mathematical framework for such a&#10;synthesis is NETWORK SCIENCE, a relatively new interdisciplinary field&#10;that provides theoretical and mathematical rigor to the study of nervous&#10;system disorders. Here, we offer the reader an overview of key concepts,&#10;methods, and findings from the application of network science to the&#10;neurosciences broadly defined, and we offer a vision for the future&#10;contributions of network analysis to our understanding and treatment of&#10;nervous system disorders.">

<outline text="Why Networks?" _note="To predict, diagnose, and treat nervous system disorders, we must&#10;simultaneously develop appropriate theoretical perspectives and analytic&#10;techniques that can transform the ever-increasing body of neural data&#10;into fundamental understanding. Historically, such perspectives and&#10;techniques have focused on univariate descriptors of neural function,&#10;behavior, and clinical outcomes. These univariate approaches have been&#10;critically important, offering insights into the consequences of local&#10;neural degeneration and damage on symptomatology. Nevertheless, evidence&#10;suggests that incorporating information from multiple variables of&#10;interest – either from brain or behavior – may offer more accurate&#10;biomarkers for disease and therapeutic interventions. Recently developed&#10;multivariate and machine learning techniques can be used to combine&#10;separate types of univariate information into predictive models to&#10;diagnose and treat patients.&#10;&#10;While multivariate techniques for data analysis are important, not all&#10;of them offer true theories of nervous system disorders. This limitation&#10;stems in part from the fact that establishing robust theoretical links&#10;between pathology, clinical syndromes, and treatment requires that the&#10;nervous system be studied at the appropriate scale(s) with adequate&#10;representations of the system of interest. A fundamental limitation to&#10;univariate and many common multivariate techniques is that they do not&#10;always represent the complex relationships within and between neural&#10;systems, genes, and behaviors. Addressing this limitation is critical&#10;for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of nervous system disorders,&#10;which carry with them heavy burdens both to individuals and to society.&#10;&#10;Network analysis is well-positioned to address this gap. Having a&#10;mathematically rigorous foundation in graph theory, network analysis can&#10;be used to represent the complex pathological processes observable in&#10;nervous system disorders, to map pathology to mental function and&#10;behavior, and to bridge basic neuroscience and translational practice.&#10;These capabilities appear particularly appropriate for the study of the&#10;brain due to its inherent multi-scale network architecture . Moreover,&#10;the utility of network analysis in understanding nervous system&#10;disorders is bolstered by the fact that the underlying pathophysiology&#10;often affects distributed network systems across multiple&#10;spatio-temporal scales . A natural goal for network analysis in nervous&#10;system disorders is therefore to identify network descriptions of&#10;pathophysiological processes and to use that knowledge to develop&#10;appropriate clinical interventions.">

<outline text="Network Analysis" _note="Mathematically, a network can be represented by the graph , where is a&#10;set of nodes that describe the components of a system, and where is a&#10;set of edges that describe relationships between nodes. In a typical&#10;network analysis, the graph represents a system and can be used to study&#10;the system’s structure and function. Graph theory is thus concise in the&#10;sense that it offers a simple mathematical representation of a complex&#10;system, and is flexible in the sense that any system built from&#10;components and pairwise interactions can be represented as a graph. As&#10;an aside, we note that a graph is a natural representation of a system&#10;characterized by pairwise relationships, but systems that display higher&#10;order relationships require other representations .&#10;&#10;The graph can be parsimoniously encoded in an adjacency matrix, , whose&#10;element represents the weight of the edge between node and node .&#10;Importantly, a network can be either BINARY, where the elements of are&#10;either 0 or 1, or it can be WEIGHTED, where the elements of take values&#10;within a given range. In addition, a network can be either UNDIRECTED,&#10;where edges represent bidirectional connections leading to a symmetric&#10;adjacency matrix, or it can be DIRECTED, where the edge from node to&#10;node may have a different weight than the edge from node to node .&#10;&#10;Selecting which network representation to use for a given system is an&#10;important process, and one that requires careful thought . For systems&#10;in which relationships between components can be quantified accurately&#10;and confidently, a weighted network representation is appropriate . If&#10;relationships can only be characterized confidently as present or&#10;absent, then a binary representation is appropriate. An undirected&#10;network may be used when no meaningful sense of direction exists in the&#10;data, whereas a directed network is often preferable to accurately&#10;represent a system in which one node causally influences another node.&#10;&#10;In the context of the nervous system, network analysis can be applied to&#10;any data for which there are at least two nodes and at least one edge.&#10;Thus, network analysis could be applied to the interactions between&#10;genes, neurons, neuronal ensembles, cortical columns, or Brodmann areas,&#10;or it could be applied simultaneously across two or more of these&#10;spatial scales. In this entry, we focus predominantly on studies&#10;examining the network structure and function of large-scale neural units&#10;(areas) within the human nervous system.">
  <outline text="Types of Networks in the Nervous System" _note="Networks in nervous systems are typically categorized as STRUCTURAL or&#10;FUNCTIONAL (Fig. \[fig:networktypes\]). In human neuroimaging,&#10;anatomical networks are often constructed from diffusion imaging data,&#10;which offers measurements of white matter microstructure. By applying&#10;sophisticated tractography algorithms to this data, one can estimate the&#10;probability with which one large-scale brain region connects to another&#10;via a white matter tract. These anatomical connections – or physical&#10;pathways – between all possible pairs of brain regions can be naturally&#10;represented in a graph, which can then provide information about&#10;fundamental organizational principles of brain architecture.&#10;&#10;Other sorts of structural features of brain tissue can also be used to&#10;construct graphs. For example, so-called MORPHOMETRIC networks represent&#10;co-variation in gray matter thickness, gray matter density, surface&#10;area, surface curvature, or cortical thickness across subjects .&#10;Importantly, the architecture of a morphometric network must be&#10;interpreted in a fundamentally different manner than the architecture of&#10;a white matter network. An edge in a morphmetric network indicates that&#10;two brain areas display morphometric features that strongly co-vary over&#10;subjects, perhaps driven by mutually trophic effects , or by common&#10;disease mechanisms .&#10;&#10;Functional networks can be used to encode statistical similarities in&#10;the time series of regional activity, as measured by functional&#10;neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging&#10;(fMRI), and electrophysiological techniques such as&#10;electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG),&#10;electrocorticography (ECoG), and multi-electrode recordings . Common&#10;measures of association that quantify statistical similarities in&#10;regional time series include correlation, coherence, and mutual&#10;information. Here, network edges can represent communication,&#10;coordination, or shared influences. Edges can also represent causal&#10;relationships between areas, and their strength can be estimated by&#10;transfer entropy, dynamic causal modeling, or structural equation&#10;modeling.&#10;&#10;In some cases, we might be interested in functional, morphometric, or&#10;structural networks that change over time : for example, on the order of&#10;milliseconds in the case of ECoG, seconds or minutes in the case of&#10;fMRI, and months or years in the case of diffusion imaging data. Efforts&#10;to address questions about how brain network architecture may change in&#10;a given time scale (or over multiple time scales) have led to the&#10;development of dynamic network analysis techniques . One of the more&#10;common techniques for temporal networks that still derives from graph&#10;theory and network science is that of so-called MULTILAYER networks. A&#10;multilayer network is a network that is composed not just of a single&#10;adjacency matrix, but of multiple adjacency matrices linked to one&#10;another over time by identity links . While the tools are broadly&#10;applicable across data types, most studies to date have quantified the&#10;time-varying properties of functional networks at rest or during the&#10;performance of cognitively demanding tasks, and have examined both&#10;healthy subjects and patients with clinical syndromes (See&#10;Fig. \[fig:dynamicnetwork\]).&#10;&#10;While it does seem natural to treat a region as a node in a brain&#10;network, recent work has also explored other construction methods in&#10;which nodes are used to represent other features of the data. For&#10;example, nodes can be patterns of activity at a fixed point in time, and&#10;edges can then encode similarities in the activity patterns of two&#10;different points in time. In another formulation, connections themselves&#10;can be treated as nodes, and similarities in the time series of&#10;connection weights can be treated as network edges . These and other&#10;complementary construction methods can offer different insights into&#10;brain structure and function, and its alteration in nervous system&#10;disorders.">

  <outline text="Characterizing Brain Networks Using Graph Statistics" _note="After carefully constructing the brain network that is appropriate for a&#10;given scientific question, one is faced with the challenge of&#10;quantitatively characterizing its structure and relating that&#10;characterization to its function. A relatively small number of graph&#10;statistics have been used frequently in brain network analysis to better&#10;understand and treat nervous system disorders. These include summary&#10;measures that describe entire networks as well as statistics that&#10;characterize the role of single regions or single edges . Below, we&#10;address each of these types of statistics separately.">
    <outline text="NODE STATISTICS." _note="Several graph statistics characterize the role of a single node within&#10;the network. Arguably the simplest is the node DEGREE, which in binary&#10;networks can be defined as the number of edges connected to a node. In&#10;weighted networks, the WEIGHTED DEGREE (or STRENGTH) is the sum of edge&#10;weights connected to a node. Node degree and strength represent the&#10;simplest form of CENTRALITY in a network; nodes of high centrality are&#10;thought to be particularly influential on the network’s function.&#10;Indeed, in brain networks, nodes with high degree are referred to as&#10;network hubs, and are thought to be critical for optimal information&#10;transmission and circuit-level computations .&#10;&#10;Beyond degree and strength centrality, other centrality statistics&#10;include betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector&#10;centrality. Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node&#10;participates in shortest paths throughout the network; here, a shortest&#10;path is the path between node and node that traverses the fewest number&#10;of edges. Nodes with high betweenness are thought to be particularly&#10;influential brokers of information between different parts of the&#10;network. Closeness centrality quantifies the average shortest path&#10;between a given node and all other nodes in the graph; it is therefore&#10;commonly used as a measure of a node’s ability to communicate quite&#10;broadly to the rest of the network. Eigenvector centrality uses the&#10;eigenspectrum of the adjacency matrix to quantify the influence of a&#10;node based on its connectedness with other high-scoring nodes in a&#10;network (See Fig.  \[fig:nodestatistics\]). Highly central nodes –&#10;defined by any of these statistics – are sometimes referred to as hubs&#10;given their predicted role in network function .&#10;&#10;Another useful metric to characterize a node’s potential role in network&#10;function is the clustering coefficient, which describes how close its&#10;nearest neighbors are to being a clique (i.e., a completely connected&#10;subgraph). More specifically, the local clustering coefficient can be&#10;defined as the number of triangles in the network containing a node,&#10;divided by the number of connected triples containing that same node .&#10;Intuitively, the clustering coefficient is a measure of the density of&#10;connections in a node’s local neighborhood, and therefore it is often&#10;used to probe the potential of a node to participate in local&#10;information integration. A complementary notion is that of node&#10;“efficiency”, which probes the organization of the edges among neighbors&#10;of a given node, thus offering a notion of the network’s robustness to a&#10;node’s removal .&#10;&#10;">
    </outline>
    <outline text="EDGE STATISTICS." _note="In addition to quantifying features of a node and its role in the&#10;network, one might also be interested in quantifying features of an&#10;edge. Perhaps the simplest statistic for an edge is its weight, which&#10;provides information about the strength of the relationship between two&#10;nodes. Moving beyond pairwise information, one can also compute&#10;something like the edge betweenness centrality, which measures the&#10;number of shortest paths between all possible pairs of nodes that pass&#10;through the edge of interest. Similar to the betweenness centrality of a&#10;node, the betweenness centrality of an edge is thought to represent its&#10;importance in efficient information transfer in networks. These are just&#10;a couple of examples of useful statistics for edges that can help one to&#10;understand the role of a node-node relationship in the broader network.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="GLOBAL STATISTICS." _note="While node and edge statistics are useful when one wishes to understand&#10;local structure in a network, more global statistics are important for&#10;characterizing over-arching organizational principles. Perhaps the&#10;simplest statistic is a network’s density: the number of existing edges&#10;relative to the number of possible edges. Many natural networks exhibit&#10;sparse connectivity – or low values of density – due to the fact that&#10;edges are costly. Arguably the most well-studied global characteristic&#10;of a network is the shape of its degree (or strength) distribution.&#10;Heavy-tailed degree distributions indicate the presence of unexpectedly&#10;large hubs. It is often interesting to ask whether these hubs&#10;preferentially connect to one another . An assortative network is one in&#10;which like-degree nodes tend to connect to one another, and a&#10;disassortative network is one in which unlike-degree nodes tend to&#10;connect to one another. In some networks, assortativity can be a marker&#10;of robustness: the removal of one high-degree node can be overcome by&#10;the interconnectedness of the others .&#10;&#10;Moreover, all networks can be characterized by average values of their&#10;nodal statistics: for example, the clustering coefficient of a network&#10;is equal to the average clustering coefficient of that network’s nodes.&#10;High global clustering in a network indicates that nodes tend to be&#10;highly connected across all possible cliques of greater than two nodes.&#10;The CHARACTERISTIC path length refers to the average shortest path&#10;between all pairs of nodes in the network. A short characteristic path&#10;length is thought to represent the potential for high integration across&#10;the network . Global efficiency is a notion that is complementary to the&#10;characteristic path length, and can be calculated as the inverse of the&#10;harmonic mean of the shortest paths in the network . A network with a&#10;smaller characteristic path length has a higher global efficiency . If&#10;one is interested in studying not just the shortest path but also longer&#10;paths or walks through the network, then one might wish to consider the&#10;statistic of network communicability . From a practical point of view,&#10;it is important to note that measures of global clustering, path length,&#10;efficiency and others are heavily influenced by the network’s density&#10;(or average strength), and it is therefore important to normalize graph&#10;density (strength) prior to making statistical inferences in the context&#10;of neuroimaging applications.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="MESOSCALE STATISTICS." _note="In some cases, one wishes to ask whether a network displays a mesoscale&#10;organization: that is, a structure that is not easily characterized at&#10;either the local or global scales. A particularly important example of&#10;mesoscale organization is modular structure, which refers to the&#10;tendency for a network to have relatively dense connections between&#10;nodes located in a single module, and relatively sparse connections&#10;between nodes located in different modules. A second important example&#10;of mesoscale organization is core-periphery structure, which refers to&#10;the tendency for a network to have a core of densely interconnected&#10;nodes surrounded by a periphery of nodes that connect to the core but&#10;tend not to connect to other nodes in the periphery. Modularity is&#10;thought to offer a balance between the information integration and&#10;segregation capabilities of a network, while core-periphery structure&#10;can offer centralized processing.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="EXTENDING GRAPH STATISTICS TO THE TEMPORAL DOMAIN." _note="Recent efforts have begun to ask how we can extend graph statistics to&#10;the temporal domain. This question is motivated by the fact that brain&#10;network dynamics are inherently non-stationary, exhibiting temporally&#10;variable yet coordinated patterns of activity that can be systemically&#10;altered in nervous system disorders. To quantify brain network&#10;(re)organization over time and its relationship to cognitive function,&#10;one can consider TIME-VARYING network representations of neuroimaging&#10;data such as dynamic notions of modularity and core-periphery structure&#10;. These and related approaches can be used to uncover fluctuations in&#10;statistics that occur at the node, edge, global, and mesoscale levels of&#10;brain network organization . Inherently dynamic statistics include&#10;flexibility and promiscuity , which can be associated with&#10;symptomatology or neuropsychological test scores.">

  <outline text="Using Graph Statistics" _note="Graph statistics are natural descriptors of network organization, and&#10;can be used to demonstrate (i) that the architecture of the brain&#10;network is unlike that expected in an appropriate null model network,&#10;(ii) that networks drawn from two or more cohorts display important&#10;similarities or differences, and (iii) that network architecture is&#10;non-trivially related to an external variable of interest, such as age&#10;or cognitive performance. In this section, we briefly discuss the&#10;utility of common graph statistics for these 3 general types of&#10;scientific questions.">
    <outline text="BRAIN NETWORKS &lt;em&gt;VERSUS&lt;/em&gt; NULL MODEL NETWORKS." _note="When studying a brain network, one often wishes to demonstrate that the&#10;architecture observed in the real data is unlike that expected under a&#10;null hypothesis . Alternatively, one might also wish to demonstrate that&#10;the real data is LIKE a canonical graph model that has previously been&#10;demonstrated to afford important functional capabilities to the system.&#10;Thus, graph models are a critical part of brain network analysis .&#10;&#10;An Erdos-Renyi graph is also called a random graph, and is characterized&#10;by the fact that nodes have an equal probability of connecting to one&#10;another . In contrast, a regular network is one in which all nodes have&#10;exactly neighbors. While a random graph has short path length, a regular&#10;graph has high clustering. Seminal work from Watts and Strogatz&#10;demonstrated that it is straightforward to show that a small-world graph&#10;is a natural intermediate architecture between these two models .&#10;Small-world networks display high clustering similar to a regular graph&#10;but short path length similar to a random graph. Commonly observed in&#10;brain networks, this combination of architectural features can be&#10;estimated in real data and is thought to support a balance between&#10;information integration and segregation : the high clustering of the&#10;network allows for local processing to occur without being influenced by&#10;computations occurring at other nodes, whereas the short path length&#10;allows for ease of communication between nodes (or by extension modules)&#10;. Scale-free networks display a power-law degree distribution, while&#10;other networks exhibit a truncated power-law degree distribution,&#10;indicating the presence of a few highly connected hubs . A different&#10;type of scaling is observed in fractal networks with hierarchically&#10;modular structure . See Fig. \[fig:globalstatistics\] for some example&#10;canonical graph structures.&#10;&#10;Each of these graph models can be used as a null model (to prove&#10;architectural features that are unique to the brain) or a veritable&#10;model (to prove architectural features that are shared with the brain).&#10;These models fall into the category of models for static&#10;(time-invariant) networks. However, recent work has extended these&#10;notions to temporal (time-varying) networks. The most common temporal&#10;null models currently used in the literature are permutation based: one&#10;can permute time, node identity, and connection patterns , for example,&#10;using a rewiring rule that maintains the underlying degree distribution&#10;. Together, these null models are critical for statistical inference,&#10;and motivate the further development of other null models with&#10;increasingly realistic neurobiological structure.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="GROUP SUMMARIES AND GROUP COMPARISONS." _note="In addition to demonstrating that the architecture of a brain network is&#10;unlike that expected in an appropriate null model network, one might&#10;also wish to demonstrate that networks drawn from two or more cohorts&#10;display important similarities or differences. In some cases, addressing&#10;this question may begin with summarizing the network structure observed&#10;in a single cohort. While averaging networks across a group seems&#10;natural , this approach often fails to adequately reflect the topology&#10;of the individual networks in the group . A promising alternative is the&#10;use of exponential random graph models , which can more accurately&#10;reflect the topological characteristics of the ensemble . Alternatively,&#10;one can perform analyses on single subjects, and then summarize those&#10;statistics over the group. For example, in the context of modular&#10;structure, one can construct a representative partition of network nodes&#10;into modules using consensus methods, which identify modules that are&#10;relatively consistent across a group of subjects or time points .&#10;&#10;After summarizing network architecture within a group, one might wish to&#10;compare network architecture between groups, such as between a patient&#10;sample and appropriately matched healthy controls. After computing a&#10;network statistic of interest in both samples, one can compare them&#10;using either parametric or non-parametric statistics. While parametric&#10;approaches such as -tests, logistic regression, and analysis of variance&#10;can sometimes be useful, often the data violates the underlying&#10;assumptions of these approaches . In contrast, non-parametric&#10;permutation tests that randomize the observed network data associations&#10;across groups can provide a more stringent statistical comparison.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="ASSOCIATION AND PREDICTION." _note="Beyond group differences, one also often wishes to demonstrate that&#10;network architecture is non-trivially related to an external variable of&#10;interest, such as age, cognitive performance, or clinical symptoms.&#10;Perhaps the most common method to relate a network statistic to a&#10;cognitive or behavioral variable is to compute the correlation&#10;coefficient between the two variables. If one is interested in the&#10;relationships between more than two variables, one could apply canonical&#10;correlation analysis, which can be used to relate many network features&#10;to clinical symptoms . Other multivariate techniques include&#10;multivariate (logistic) regression, mixed effects models, and causal&#10;inference techniques such as statistical mediation and structural&#10;equation modeling . These and related approaches enable the examination&#10;of cross-sectional assocations between network features and clinical&#10;symptoms, as well as longitudinal predictors of clinical symptomatology.&#10;The overarching goal is to clarify the network phenotypes associated&#10;with clinical syndromes, and to identify their underlying mechanisms.">

<outline text="Networks and the Healthy Nervous System" _note="To understand the alterations in brain networks that might accompany&#10;nervous system disorders, we must first understand the organization of&#10;brain networks in healthy subjects. There are several general&#10;organizational principles of brain network architecture that have been&#10;consistently observed across different cohorts, imaging modalities, and&#10;spatial scales of investigation. Perhaps the most historic is that of&#10;small-world organization , the simultaneous presence of both high&#10;clustering and short path length , which is thought to support optimal&#10;information processing and transmission. This architecture is consistent&#10;with a heavy-tailed degree distribution indicating the presence of&#10;network hubs . At a mesoscale level, brain networks display heirarchical&#10;modular structure, with large modules being composed of smaller modules&#10;. In both structural and functional networks, the large modules&#10;correspond to well-characterized cognitive systems including motor,&#10;auditory, visual, fronto-parietal, salience, and attention networks (See&#10;Fig. \[fig:globalhealthyorganization\]). Together, these organizational&#10;principles meet the evolutionary demand for information processing&#10;efficiency, flexibility, and robustness that is necessary for healthy&#10;cognitive function&#10;&#10;Exactly how different features of a network’s organization support&#10;cognitive processes is a matter of ongoing research . Ultimately, the&#10;goal is to construct a validated theory that links the historic and&#10;ongoing efforts in careful neuroanatomy and physiology, to the recent&#10;perspective of the brain as a networked system or connectome, in a way&#10;that explains cognition and behavior. To be slightly more concrete, we&#10;might wish to understand (i) how the computations that occur in a single&#10;cytoarchitectonic region (originally characterized by Korbinian Brodmann&#10;in 1909 ) are integrated with those of another cytoarchitectonic region&#10;via white matter tracts, (ii) how that integration leads to changes in&#10;the patterns of functional connectivity observed in functional&#10;neuroimaging data, and (iii) how local computations, transmission along&#10;white matter, and dynamic patterns of connectivity can support cognition&#10;(Fig. \[fig:nodestonetworks\]). While a full theory is far from defined,&#10;recent efforts address three major themes: the role of network “hubs”,&#10;the architecture of intrinsic functional networks, and the existence of&#10;a complex heterarchy in the human brain.&#10;&#10;">
  <outline text="The Role of Hubs in the Healthy Nervous System" _note="Network hubs are interpreted as highly central nodes , but their&#10;mathematical definition is currently a bit nebulous. Most commonly, hubs&#10;are defined as nodes with high values of some centrality statistic&#10;(Fig. \[fig:hubs\]), putatively enabling them to regulate information&#10;processing by governing interregional communication along short paths&#10;through the network . In structural networks built from diffusion&#10;imaging data, hubs are located in the precuneus, anterior and posterior&#10;cingulate cortex, insular cortex, superior frontal cortex, temporal&#10;cortex, and lateral parietal cortex , areas of the brain that are&#10;commonly thought of as transmodal or heteromodal areas involved in&#10;integrating processing across several cognitive modalities . In&#10;functional networks, hubs are concentrated in the ventral and dorsal&#10;precuneus, posterior and anterior cingulate gyrus, ventromedial frontal&#10;cortex, and inferior parietal brain areas. Some of these regions overlap&#10;with the default mode system that displays high activation when subjects&#10;are simply resting , while others overlap with the fronto-parietal&#10;system, and are known to adaptively reconfigure communication with&#10;different cognitive systems during task performance .&#10;&#10;Hubs are suggested to be important for cognition because they are&#10;located along shortest paths in the nework, and therefore are likely to&#10;play a critical role in distributed patterns of communication. This&#10;location is evident both by their high degree, and by their tendency to&#10;connect to one another, forming a core or “rich-club” that boosts the&#10;robustness of inter-hub communication and promotes efficient&#10;communication across the brain . Hubs are a cost-efficient solution to&#10;the problem of increasing network efficiency to support cogntive&#10;processes without requiring many metabolically expensive connections,&#10;and their existence is therefore thought to have been driven by&#10;evolutionary pressures . Because of their central role in the network’s&#10;topology, damage to brain hubs – particularly those in the rich club –&#10;is expected to be especially consequential for cognitive function in&#10;terms of the severity and pervasiveness of cognitive deficits .&#10;&#10;">
  </outline>
  <outline text="The Architecture of Intrinsic Brain Networks" _note="The first two decades of fMRI studies of human cognition largely focused&#10;on signal amplitude and connectivity that were elicited or evoked by the&#10;performance of a cognitively demanding task. However, recent evidence&#10;demonstrates that the brain also displays interesting network&#10;architecture even outside of the explicit requirements of a task. This&#10;baseline connectivity is often referred to as INTRINSIC functional&#10;connectivity , and is characterized by strong inter-regional&#10;correlations in BOLD magnitudes in the default mode network :&#10;ventromedial frontal cortices, anterior and posterior cingulate, and&#10;inferior parietal areas. The default mode network can be consistently&#10;identified whether subjects are resting with eyes closed or eyes open,&#10;and – interestingly – becomes deactivated when a subject moves from rest&#10;to the performance of a cognitively demanding task .&#10;&#10;In addition to the default mode network, intrinsic functional&#10;connectivity patterns also show strong inter-regional correlations in&#10;BOLD signal in other sets of brain areas. These sets are referred to as&#10;modules, networks, or cognitive systems in common parlance , and include&#10;motor, visual, auditory, memory, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular,&#10;salience, and attention systems. Regions within these systems activate&#10;together as a unit during the performance of cognitive tasks , and they&#10;also communicate with one another across a variety of tasks , with&#10;slight variations in patterns of connectivity in different tasks .&#10;Interestingly, the patterns in BOLD activation that are elicited by&#10;cognitively demanding tasks can be predicted by the time-averaged&#10;patterns of functional connectivity using a simplified activity “flow”&#10;model , suggesting that fast-time-scale activity and and slow-time-scale&#10;connectivity are simply related to one another.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Complex Heterarchy" _note="The combined presence of both network hubs and network modules supports&#10;the notion that there may be several different dimensions of&#10;organization in the brain that critically support the complexity of&#10;cognitive function. That is, it is not simply enough to list network&#10;hubs to understand cognition, as such a list would miss the fact that&#10;regions are grouped into systems that collectively support a cognitive&#10;process, such as decision-making, reward processing, or visual&#10;perception. Likewise, simply listing the modules in the network that&#10;support each process overlooks how those modules are integrated with one&#10;another, largely through the connectivity of network hubs within the&#10;brain’s rich-club. Thus, these two features of network organization –&#10;hubs and modules – form orthogonal dimensions that support cognition.&#10;&#10;The notion that different parts of a system can have different rankings&#10;of importance depending on the taxonomy used is not new in neuroscience.&#10;In fact, in 1945, McCulloch suggested that the brain is a complex&#10;heterarchy, characterized by multiple hierarchies defined in different&#10;ways . A full understanding of cognitive processes may therefore require&#10;a description of the hubs that are activated by the process, the modules&#10;that are formed or that change during the process, and the&#10;core-periphery structure that might support the process. Moreover, it&#10;may also require an understanding of how these notions of ranking or&#10;hierarchy map to the more traditional notions of higher-order cognitive&#10;systems being closer to the pinnacle of cognition than sensorimotor&#10;systems (although see for other perspectives on the presence of&#10;higher-order information in primary areas). Such a comprehensive&#10;description of cognitive function is an important area of active&#10;research in the field of network neuroscience.">

<outline text="Major Findings in Network Analysis for Nervous System Disorders." _note="The emerging network neuroscience of healthy humans sets the stage for&#10;understanding nervous system disorders. In particular, neurological&#10;dysfunction can be thought of as the consequence of damage to brain&#10;regions and connections. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the&#10;disordered function characterstic of clinical syndromes can be linked to&#10;alterations in the brain’s intrinsic connectivity, pathways from&#10;sensorimotor cortex to higher-order cognitive areas, network hubs, and&#10;the rich-club. To address this hypothesis, recent efforts have applied&#10;network analysis to neuroimaging data acquired in patients with nervous&#10;systems disorders, largely focusing on describing alterations in global,&#10;mesoscale, and local network organization. In the following sections, we&#10;highlight a few major findings from anatomical and functional network&#10;analysis in nervous system disorders. Given the already vast number of&#10;studies in this area, we pay particular attention to essential themes in&#10;clinical research, and we refer the reader to reviews for more specific&#10;information where relevant.">
  <outline text="Network Disruption in Nervous System Disorders" _note="Studies aimed at detecting disruptions in the brain’s functional and&#10;structural organization in nervous system disorders date back to the&#10;early 21st century. Here we highlight major results from network&#10;analysis in several of the most frequently examined neurological&#10;disorders and we refer the reader to for further details.">
    <outline text="Neurodegenerative disorders." _note="Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive loss of&#10;neural tissue due to insidious biological pathology that manifests in&#10;different locations in the brain, and across different spatial scales of&#10;organization. The clinical syndromes associated with neurodegenerative&#10;disorders often begin to be detected in adults. Examples include&#10;diseases with onsets late in life such as Alzheimer’s disease,&#10;frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or Parkinson’s disease, middle age&#10;onset such as in Huntington’s disease, and variable onset amyotrophic&#10;lateral sclerosis. Each disorder is associated with complex symptom&#10;profiles that span both cognitive and motor domains. A major challenge&#10;in neurodegenerative disease is to articulate theories of functional&#10;loss, predict disease progression, and identify potential treatment&#10;mechanisms to preclude, halt, or reverse disease.&#10;&#10;Network-based studies of neurodegenerative disorders have been most&#10;prominent in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar&#10;degeneration (FTLD). Studies constructing functional brain networks from&#10;electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and positron&#10;emission tomography (PET) acquired at rest have reported reduced&#10;clustering coefficients and local efficiency in AD in comparison to&#10;healthy controls , although an opposite trend has been observed in fMRI&#10;data . Node centrality is consistently decreased in AD in higher-ordered&#10;association areas, including the temporal lobe, medial parietal,&#10;posterior and anterior cingulate, and medial frontal areas . Moreover,&#10;the preference of hubs to connect to one another is decreased in AD but&#10;increased in FTD . These central and high-degree areas also show the&#10;greatest relative amount of amyloid deposition in AD , suggesting a&#10;possible link between amyloid pathology and the vulnerability of network&#10;hubs .&#10;&#10;While the trends for clustering and centrality are fairly consistent&#10;across studies, those for path length are less consistent. Increased&#10;path length in certain disorders has been reported in studies using&#10;group-level cortical thickness correlations, MRI tractography and fMRI ,&#10;potentially explaining the observed decrease in the AD brain’s predicted&#10;ability to synchronize . However, even using a single imaging&#10;technology, such as fMRI, opposite changes in path length have been&#10;reported in the same disorder . These discrepancies could be driven by&#10;differences in processing techniques , and therefore the question of&#10;whether functional differences in path length are pathognomonic to&#10;neurodegeneration remains open.&#10;&#10;Studies of mesoscale architecture have suggested that modular&#10;organization in the brain is disrupted in AD , with particular&#10;alterations in the parietal module. A recent MEG study showed that both&#10;the connections within this module and the connections between this&#10;module and other modules are decreased in AD . Notably, a pattern of&#10;module disconnection has also been observed in studies that used fMRI&#10;data . Importantly, these findings suggest that at least some of the&#10;presenting clinical features in neurodegeneration are associated with&#10;disruption in information integration and segregation across specialized&#10;functional modules in the brain.">

    <outline text="Multiple Sclerosis." _note="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive demyelinating disorder&#10;characterized by inflammation and degeneration in myelin in the brain.&#10;MS can occur in isolated attacks or can display a more continuous&#10;progression. MS typically has an onset between 20 and 50 years of age&#10;and is associated with symptoms including double vision, unilateral&#10;blindness, muscle weakness, sensation deficits, and discoordination. MS&#10;is observed twice as commonly in women as men and lowers life expectancy&#10;by 5 to 10 years .&#10;&#10;Several studies have characterized altered functional network topology&#10;in MS. An MEG study showed increased functional connectivity in the&#10;theta, lower alpha and beta bands, and decreased functional connectivity&#10;in the upper alpha band in individuals with MS compared with healthy&#10;controls . In addition, changes in the normalized clustering coefficient&#10;in the lower alpha band were associated with impaired cognition. A&#10;second MEG study investigated networks in source space by using a&#10;connectivity measure that was unbiased by volume conduction . Compared&#10;with healthy controls, individuals with MS had functional networks that&#10;were more integrated in the theta band and more segregated in the alpha&#10;and beta bands. A disruption of hierarchical network organization in the&#10;upper alpha band was associated with impaired cognition, whereas&#10;disturbed beta band connectivity of the default mode network was&#10;associated with both impaired cognition and motor deficits .&#10;&#10;One large study provided evidence for a shift from global to local&#10;connectivity in cognitively impaired MS patients relative to unimpaired&#10;patients . Finally, a resting-state fMRI study found a correlation&#10;between decreased functional connectivity and cognitive impairment in&#10;male patients with MS but not in female patients . Thus, across&#10;functional studies, evidence suggests that cognitive impairments may&#10;result from disruptions in heirarchical and modular network&#10;organization, and these features may be specific to middle frequency&#10;ranges in the human brain.&#10;&#10;Turning to structure and morphometry, we note that cortical thickness&#10;analyses have revealed altered small-world topology in MS that&#10;correlates with white matter pathology . Diffusion tractography networks&#10;display reduced global efficiency and reduced local efficiency in the&#10;default mode, and in primary sensory and motor cortices . These&#10;alterations occurred alongside increased node centrality in other brain&#10;regions such as the orbital frontal, superior frontal, middle frontal,&#10;and fusiform gyri.&#10;&#10;Overall, MS has received a relatively less extensive network analysis&#10;focus in the literature. The links between cognition, specific network&#10;changes, interactions with sex, and frequency-specific changes have not&#10;been thoroughly established. In addition, some network statistics are&#10;found to be increased and others decreased in MS anatomy, and no&#10;intuitive relationship to cognitive decline has been identified. It is&#10;timely to invigorate efforts into examining functional disturbances in&#10;MS to identify mechanisms of cognitive decline.">

    <outline text="Traumatic Brain Injury." _note="Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result from exogenous forces such as&#10;penetrating (“open”) or blunt force (“closed&quot;) trauma to the brain, or&#10;from endogenous hemorrhaging that results in stroke. Closed TBI often&#10;involves damage to neural bodies in gray matter depending on the&#10;location of trauma. TBI can also give rise to diffuse axonal injury&#10;across white matter tracts in the brain due to the stretching and&#10;shearing that results from forceful impacts and rotations of the&#10;cranium.&#10;&#10;Anatomical studies of TBI reveal increased shortest path length and&#10;decreased global efficiency . In addition, hub regions are altered in&#10;TBI, including the reduction of hub scores for the left superior frontal&#10;gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus and&#10;increases in hub scores for the left precentral gyrus, right&#10;supplementary motor area, and left putamen . Moreover, in a larger&#10;study, machine learning approaches identified that betweenness&#10;centrality and eigenvector centrality were associated with patient&#10;processing speed, executive function, and associative memory in a sample&#10;where these same statistics were reduced within network hubs .&#10;Collectively, these data suggest that global and local measures of&#10;information processing efficiency are selectively disrupted in TBI and&#10;contribute to cognitive deficits.&#10;&#10;Most studies of functional network organization in TBI have used resting&#10;state fMRI. Early in recovery, TBI is associated with increases in&#10;functional connectivity that decrease in the first few months following&#10;injury . Later following TBI, the strength of long-distance connections&#10;decreases , increasing the network’s path length and by extension&#10;disrupting the brain’s small-world topology, which only partially&#10;recovers over time . Like AD, TBI is characterized by the selective&#10;damage of hub-like structures in the association cortices and the&#10;default mode network , and notably these changes are associated with&#10;impaired consciousness in TBI . Specifically, hubs are redistributed&#10;from the fusiform gyrus and precuneus to the angular gyrus in patients&#10;with TBI . TBI is also associated with changes in the modular structure&#10;of functional brain networks . Individuals who sustained shock blast&#10;demonstrated a reduced participation coefficient , indicating selective&#10;disruption to intermodular communication.&#10;&#10;These studies suggest that functionally, TBI can result in a loss of&#10;(especially long-distance) functional connectivity, presumably as a&#10;result of the combined influences of initial diffuse axonal injury&#10;followed by neuroplastic processes. These network-level changes can have&#10;a direct impact on cognitive dysfunction. In a sample of individuals&#10;with stroke, focal damage to the inferior parietal lobe, which&#10;participates in several major functional brain systems, is strongly&#10;associated with pronounced global cognitive impairment , whereas damage&#10;to other high degree regions produced more circumscribed deficits. This&#10;promotes the important notion that a node’s centrality in the network’s&#10;topology can be indicative of that node’s potential for catastrophic&#10;failure when damaged.">

    <outline text="Epilepsy." _note="Epilepsy is a seizure disorder that can be inherited or that can result&#10;from infection (meningitis), tumors, abnormal dysplastic tissue&#10;formation, or brain damage. Seizures can vary from brief and nearly&#10;undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. Epileptic seizures are&#10;often believed to have a focus from which seizures originate . The&#10;mechanisms of epilepsy are unknown in the majority of cases, though&#10;known genetic mutations are linked to a small proportion of cases .&#10;Across afflicted individuals, the onset of seizures is highly variable&#10;in severity and frequency over the lifespan, and the effect on quality&#10;of life can range from minimal to severity debilitating .&#10;&#10;The focus of network studies of epilepsy has largely been on functional&#10;networks, and particularly those derived from EEG and MEG recordings due&#10;to the fast timescale of seizure dynamics. Studies that have assessed&#10;network changes that occur during the ictal state have produced the most&#10;consistent results. The connectivity of the default mode network is&#10;diminished both in individuals with temporal lobe and generalized&#10;epilepsy . In addition, an early study demonstrated high clustering and&#10;long path length during the ictal state , consistent with intracranial&#10;studies reporting a shift towards a more regular network topology .&#10;Ictal network regularization is also observed in scalp EEG and MEG&#10;recordings .&#10;&#10;Some studies show that EEG-and MEG-based functional brain networks in&#10;epileptics demonstrate abnormally regular networks during the INTERICTAL&#10;state as well . One study suggested that in the interictal state,&#10;regularization might occur in the theta band, whereas alpha band&#10;networks are abnormally randomized . Other studies have also shown an&#10;association between excessive synchronization in the theta band and&#10;epilepsy . In general, the interictal network topology in individuals&#10;with epilepsy seems to be shifted away from the small-world organization&#10;that is seen in healthy subjects towards an excessive regularity that is&#10;also observed during seizures.&#10;&#10;Other studies also suggest the importance of hub-like structures,&#10;particularly in high-frequency ranges, for the spreading of seizure&#10;activity . Hub-like features in EEG recordings can predict whether&#10;children will develop epilepsy after an initial seizure-like event . Two&#10;studies compared the phase synchronization and node centrality of&#10;functional networks exhibiting high-frequency oscillations that are&#10;characteristic of epileptogenic tissue . Counterintuitively, the number&#10;of oscillations was negatively correlated with node centrality in the&#10;theta band . This finding suggests that areas with high frequency&#10;oscillations and hub nodes may differ, and could represent two different&#10;portions of the epileptogenic zone. Seizure state analyses suggest that&#10;seizures constitute a finite set of brain states that progress&#10;consistently, and that seizure onset zones are isolated from surrounding&#10;regions at seizure onset . During seizure progression, topographical and&#10;geometrical changes in network connectivity strengthen and tighten&#10;synchronization near seizure foci . Notably, the epileptic zone’s&#10;activity may be controlled by a regulatory network in the surrounding&#10;tissue: A simulated resection study in drug-resistant epilepsy revealed&#10;that antagonistic “push-pull” interactions between regions synchronize&#10;and desynchronize the network, potentially suggesting a candidate for&#10;therapeutic targets .&#10;&#10;Finally, a few recent studies have combined fMRI with anatomical MRI in&#10;the same subjects to study structure-function relationships in epilepsy&#10;. These studies reveal reduced coupling between tractography-based and&#10;functional networks in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, where hub and&#10;default mode network connectivity was particularly diminished . In&#10;contrast, a study comparing fMRI derived networks with cortical&#10;thickness derived networks showed increased coupling between functional&#10;and morphometric networks . Thus, the nature of the relationship between&#10;anatomical, morphometric, and functional brain networks is a relatively&#10;open area in epilepsy. Multimodal anatomical studies combined with&#10;computational models may prove useful for pushing forward this frontier.">

    <outline text="An Integrative Summary" _note="In recent years, different investigators have focused on different&#10;aspects of network organization within and between diseases, and&#10;clinical network neuroscience does not yet provide a complete picture of&#10;aberrant network activity. While the application of network neuroscience&#10;to clinical disorders is in its infancy, some tentative initial&#10;conclusions can be drawn. First, neurological disorders result in&#10;detectable anatomical and functional network changes at the global,&#10;mesoscale, and regional levels. Second, damage to hub regions, such as&#10;those found in the structural rich club or those that participate in&#10;communication between many brain systems, is characteristic of several&#10;neurological disorders and associated with general failures of cognitive&#10;function. Third, more focal damage is associated with more focal&#10;cognitive pathology most commonly when it affects local hubs or&#10;non-hubs. Finally, neuroimaging techniques sensitive to different&#10;spatiotemporal scales of neural function uncover different effects of&#10;nervous system disorders on brain network organization and function. In&#10;the ongoing effort to describe, understand, and treat nervous system&#10;disorders, network science is well-positioned to fundamentally alter our&#10;conceptual models and inform translational efforts to enhance quality of&#10;life in these patients.">

    <outline text="Caveats and Methodological Challenges" _note="As this survey attests, concepts from graph theory have provided novel&#10;approaches to neuroimaging data collected in health and in nervous&#10;system disorders. Nevertheless, the current applications of the tools&#10;have important liabilities and limitations. One liability concerns the&#10;potential misuse of network techniques as a proxy for theory. While the&#10;brain is undoubtedly a network, a truly explanatory network theory of&#10;neurological disorders would require an account of how cognitive&#10;function occurs and also how it fails in the context of neuropathology.&#10;Whereas global, mesoscale, and regional patterns of network failure&#10;accompany nervous system disorders, a complete theoretical account that&#10;predicts and explains diverse neurological patterns of dysfunction&#10;confronting neurologists has not been established.&#10;&#10;Another important consideration concerns the inherent limitations of&#10;data collection and analysis. There exists no comprehensive measurement&#10;technique at any spatiotemporal scale of neural organization. In&#10;addition, neuroimaging data require many processing steps for network&#10;construction and interpretation, and these steps differ from one group&#10;to another potentially explaining variability in observed network&#10;phenotypes . For future progress, it is imperative that the field work&#10;towards a principled and agreed-upon processing framework to accurately&#10;and reliably detect network-level effects in nervous system disorders.">

To address this question, we must have&#10;empirical and computational tools to assess the multiscale nature of the&#10;brain.

Indeed, the tight relationship between&#10;structure and dynamics in the brain motivates ongoing efforts to&#10;understand the similarities and differences between anatomical network&#10;and functional networks.

Efforts in data analysis and&#10;modeling have been suggested to neatly separate into two main cultures .&#10;The first culture assumes that a specific process (stochastic or&#10;otherwise) produces the data at hand, and therefore uses parametric or&#10;nonparametric statistics to explicitly model relationships between&#10;independent and dependent variables. The second culture is not as&#10;concerned with an explicit model of the data, but instead seeks to use&#10;algorithms (e.g., machine learning) to identify patterns in the data,&#10;whether or not those patterns provide immediate insight into the&#10;underlying mechanisms.

    <outline text="Network Mechanisms." _note="In this review, we have purposely used the term “mechanism&quot; as freely as&#10;it is applied in the literature at large. Yet, it behooves the reader to&#10;ask the question: Exactly what is a mechanism? In one reasonable&#10;philosophical account, a mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities&#10;and activities that are responsible for the phenomenon . This definition&#10;maintains that there is a notion of cause and effect (from entities and&#10;activities to phenomena) inherent within a system’s complex organization&#10;that results in phenomena. This same perspective is epistemically useful&#10;in network neuroscience as it has been applied to the study of human&#10;cognition . However, network mechanisms – as defined in this fundamental&#10;way – have not yet been rigorously proven in nervous system disorders.">

Indeed, because network analysis explicitly bridges&#10;“localizationist” and “distributed” theories of brain function , it can&#10;be used to ask questions such as: What are the fundamental relationships&#10;between network development and damage that predict cognitive function?&#10;What structure-function network alterations underlie the diverse&#10;clinical pathology observed in nervous system disorders?

Explaining cognitive resilience and selective vulnerability in&#10;nervous system disorders is at a premium when identifying risk factors&#10;and designing clinical support.

As network neuroscience&#10;develops, it may be possible to characterize personalized phenotypes and&#10;identify the appropriate spatiotemporal scale for therapeutic targeting&#10;at the individual level. While at this stage purely speculative, it is&#10;possible that this potential may intersect with approaches such as the&#10;use of invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation in control&#10;engineering paradigms , pharmacological agents, and hybrid therapies&#10;such as ultrasonic ablation used to allow medicine to cross the blood&#10;brain barrier at specific sites .">
