<outline text="Introduction" _note="The AdS/CFT holgraphic applications in strongly coupled quantum systems&#10;exhibiting nonrelativitic symmetries near critical points has been the&#10;focus of studies recently -. Some of the holographic applications may&#10;involve strongly coupled fermionic systems at finite density or a gas of&#10;ultra cold atoms . Some related framework of Galilean symmetry were&#10;studied even earlier . For finite temperature properties such as phase&#10;transitions, transport and viscosity we include black-holes in&#10;asymptotically AdS backgrounds. For superconductivity phenomenon the&#10;4-dimensional non-relativistic geometry generically involves&#10;spontaneously broken Higgs phase where the Maxwell field is massive . We&#10;shall discuss here some examples of 10-dimensional Lifshitz spacetimes&#10;where a Higgs phase instead involves 2-rank antisymmetric tensor field&#10;and has massive fundamental strings. The two phenomena indeed have&#10;parallel from 10-dimensional perspective. It is because a Kaluza-Klein&#10;compactification of a (massive) 2-rank tensor field on a circle gives&#10;rise to a (massive) gauge field in lower dimensions.&#10;&#10;Our main interest in this work is to construct Lifshitz solutions with&#10;dynamical exponent , directly in Roman’s type IIA supergravity . The&#10;massive type IIA theory is the only known example of a 10-dimensional&#10;maximal supergravity where the string field is explicitly massive at the&#10;tree level. Thus the massive type IIA provides an unique setup to look&#10;for Lifshitz and Schrödinger like solutions which involve massive fields&#10;and study their dual nonrelativistic field theories on the boundary.&#10;There are no prior attempts to our knowledge where the same has been&#10;worked out for Romans type IIA supergravity, however massive string&#10;vacua are known to us . The have been shown to exist in type IIB string&#10;theory when appropriate axion flux is switched on . We provide an&#10;exlicit example of background, which is a solution of massive type IIA&#10;and it does involve massive -field. It is a background generated by a&#10;bound state of brane system. It is important to know all such vacua as&#10;their compactification on immediately provides the prototype background&#10;in , which is proposed to be dual to non-relativistic Lifshitz theory&#10;with dynamical exponent two. By exploiting massive T-duality symmetries&#10;in we further provide another example of background, which is generated&#10;by massless brane system in ordinary type IIA theory.&#10;&#10;The paper is organised as follows. In the section-2 we first review the&#10;relevant aspects of massive type IIA sugra action and its known&#10;Schrödinger solution. In section-3 we write down new Lifshitz solution&#10;generated by the system and discuss subtle aspects under massive&#10;T-duality for these solutions. The section-4 contains ordinary type IIA&#10;solution involving branes, which is supported by RR 2-form flux and&#10;massless -field. They have a very crucial coupling between them. The&#10;string -field gets essentially nested with constant magnetic flux of&#10;over plane. We next discuss their consistent reduction to four and five&#10;dimensions and their effective bulk theories in section-5. We provide an&#10;M-theory uplift of these vacua in section-6. A summary is provided in&#10;the section-7.">

<outline text=": massive strings" _note="In this section we mainly review some useful information about&#10;10-dimensional massive type IIA supergravity and a known Schrödinger&#10;vacua . One may choose to directly skip to the next section. The Romans&#10;type IIA theory is the only known maximal supergravity in ten dimensions&#10;which allows massive string field. The theory is described by the&#10;following bosonic action S=[1G\_N]{}where topological terms have been&#10;dropped because these would be vanishing for the Lifshitz backgrounds we&#10;shall be studying in this paper, see for details in .[^1] The field&#10;strengths are defined as&#10;H\_[(3)]{}=dB\_[(2)]{},   G\_[(2)]{}=dC\_[(1)]{} +m B\_[(2)]{},    &#10;G\_[(4)]{}=dC\_[(3)]{} +B\_[(2)]{}dC\_[(1)]{} + [m2]{}&#10;B\_[(2)]{}B\_[(2)]{} where is the mass parameter and positive&#10;cosmological constant of the 10-dimensional theory. The cosmological&#10;constant however generates a nontrivial potential term for the dilaton&#10;field. Other than the nonsupersymmetric Freund-Rubin vacua in , some&#10;known BPS solutions of the theory include D8-branes , the&#10;compactifications , the and bound states . Under the ‘massive’ T-duality&#10;the D8 brane can be mapped over to a D7 brane in ordinary type IIB&#10;string theory. The string -field is explicitly massive with mass square&#10;given by , and it plays an important role in obtaining nonrelativistic&#10;Schrödinger solutions . The massive type IIA theory however never admits&#10;a flat Minkowski vacuum solution. But in the limit the massive theory&#10;reduces to ordinary type IIA supergravity.&#10;&#10;An observed common feature in four-dimensional AdS gravity theories has&#10;been that in order to obtain Schrödinger or Lifshitz type&#10;non-relativistic solutions one needs to include massive (Proca) gauge&#10;fields in the action . (Although massless gauge fields can give rise to&#10;nonrelativistic vacua however, in simple cases of D-branes compactified&#10;along lightcone coordinate , they usually give rise to conformal (or&#10;hyperscaling) Lifshitz or Schrödinger vacua.) Particularly for massive&#10;type IIA theory the existence of Schrödinger solution has already been&#10;shown in . In the rest of this section we review the Schrödinger&#10;solution to familiarise ourselves, and also because these vacua are&#10;constituted by D0, D2, D8 branes, alongwith massive strings which we&#10;will encounter again when we write down Lifshitz solutions of the&#10;theory.&#10;&#10;The massive type IIA action in the tensorial notation is given by&#10;\[eq2l\] S=[1G\_N]{}d\^[10]{}x , with the field strengths . The&#10;equations of motion of this theory admit following solution \[sol2\]&#10;&amp;&amp;ds\^2=L\^2(-[2z\^[6]{}]{}&#10;(dx\^[+]{})\^2+[-2dx\^[+]{}dx\^[-]{}+dy\^2+dz\^2z\^2]{} +[52]{} d\_6\^2&#10;) ,&amp;&amp;e\^=g\_a,    C\_[+-y]{}= - g\_a\^[-[14]{}]{} [L\^33 z\^3]{},&#10;   C\_[+]{}= -[3]{}[ g\_a\^[-3/4]{}Lz\^3]{} &amp;&amp; B\_[+ y]{}= -[g\_a&#10;L\^22z\^4]{}  , where . But we should have string coupling and . The&#10;radius of curvature of the sphere is directly related to the mass&#10;parameter. Note that the Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken in the&#10;solutions, although spin group of the sphere is intact. The Schrödinger&#10;vacua [(\[sol2\])]{} involves a collection of D0, D2, and D8 branes&#10;(which are wrapped around ), along with massive fundamental strings (F1)&#10;stretched along direction. The Einstein equations do involve a&#10;nontrivial stress-energy tensor component that receives contributions&#10;from the lightlike components of these fields. From the solution we&#10;learn that in ten-dimensional sense the matter (dust) responsible for a&#10;Schödinger solutions is made up of D-branes and most importantly the&#10;[MASSIVE]{} strings. The boundary of the spacetime is located at , and&#10;near to the boundary the metric and fields become divergent, which&#10;usually is the case for non-relativistic vacua with .

  <outline text="D2-D8: tied up with massive strings" _note="It is known that the Freund-Rubin maximally symmetric vacua in Romans&#10;theory is constituted by branes. But there are no ‘massive’ -field&#10;excitations in them. We show that one can construct Lifshitz vacua that&#10;are supported by massive -field, D2 and D8 branes. The strings in these&#10;solutions becomes massive after gobbling up all D0 branes, unlike the&#10;Schrödinger type vacua [(\[sol2\])]{} above where some D0 branes are&#10;still present. Thus the D0 brane charges will not be explicitly seen in&#10;the following Lifshitz solutions. These higgsed Lifshitz solutions are&#10;given by (in string metric) \[sol2a\] &amp;&amp;ds\^2=’ L\^2(- [dt\^2z\^4]{}&#10;+[dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2z\^2]{}+[dz\^2z\^2]{} +[dy\^2q\^2]{} + d\_5\^2 )&#10;,&amp;&amp;e\^=g\_a,      C\_[(3)]{}= -[(’ L\^2)\^[32]{} g\_a]{}&#10;[1z\^4]{}dtdx\_1dx\_2, &amp;&amp; B\_[(2)]{}= [’ L\^2q z\^2]{}dtdy  , with ,&#10;where being the mass parameter in the Romans’ action.

Thus eq.[(\[sol2a\])]{} describes a configuration, in which D2&#10;branes are stacked inside D8 worldvolume. The D2 stack is studded&#10;(threaded) by massive F-strings, having mass . The D0 branes are all&#10;gauged away (or eaten up) by the F-strings which have become massive.&#10;This phenomenon happens due to the higgsing (or stueckelberg mechanism)&#10;in massive type IIA theory . In these solutions remains an overall&#10;isometry direction which may be compact also. The holographic coordinate&#10;acts as a common transverse direction for all the branes.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Note, from the D8 brane/domain wall correspondence , one typically&#10;    expects , a value which is definitely well within .">

So far we considered as noncompact coordinate&#10;and an associated arbitary length scale. Let us consider the case when&#10;is a compact circle, .

  <outline text="Massive  T-duality" _note="Upon compactification the Romans theory gives rise to a massive&#10;supergravity in nine dimensions. Keeping only the fields relevant for&#10;our background [(\[sol2a\])]{}, (a complete circle compactification can&#10;be found ) a massive action can be written as \[eq2\] S\~d\^[9]{}x&#10;e\^[-2\_9]{}, where the vector field which arises directly from&#10;reduction of massive tensor component is only kept in the action. The&#10;dilaton field is given by whereas defines the radion mode along . (The&#10;fields are denoted with a hat sign to distinguish them from&#10;9-dimensional ones.) The Kaluza-Klein gauge field is set to vanish. The&#10;topological terms in the action are also ignored as these are not&#10;relevant for the Lifshitz background we are studying here. By setting ,&#10;after compactification along the eq.[(\[sol2a\])]{} reduces to \[sol2b\]&#10;&amp;&amp;ds\^2\_[9d]{}=L\^2(- [dt\^2z\^4]{} +[dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2+dz\^2z\^2]{} +&#10;d\_5\^2 ) ,&amp;&amp;e\^[\_[9]{}]{}= g\_a ,    C\_[(3)]{}= -[L\^3g\_a&#10;z\^4]{}dtdx\_1dx\_2 &amp;&amp; A\_[(1)]{}= [L\^2q z\^2]{}dt,     e\^[-]{}=q\^2&#10;L\^[-2]{} , It can be checked that [(\[sol2b\])]{} is a consistent&#10;solution of the action [(\[eq2\])]{}. Actually both the dilaton and the&#10;have constant background values. Since it is a solution of type II sugra&#10;with a massive vector field, the above Lifshitz vacua can be uplifted&#10;back to 10-dimensional type IIB theory (over a dual radius circle) by&#10;exploiting ‘massive’ T-duality . By employing the massive duality rules&#10;we get following type IIB solution \[sol2c\] &amp;&amp;d[s]{}\^2\_[IIb]{}=L\^2(&#10;[\^2]{}[d\^2]{} - [2 dt dz\^2]{}&#10;+[dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2z\^2]{}+[dz\^2z\^2]{} + d\_5\^2 ) &amp;&amp; G\_[(5)]{}=&#10;[1g\_b]{}( [4L\^4z\^5]{}dtdx\_1dx\_2d dz + [self dual]{})&#10;&amp;&amp;e\^[\_b]{}=g\_b ,      = [2g\_b]{} y  . The type IIB string coupling ,&#10;radius of curvature , and flux are all independent parameters. The&#10;coupling should be kept small. The parameter determines the required&#10;axion flux and also the relative size of in the metric. (Recall an&#10;ordinary type IIB theory has no mass scale of its own unlike the Romans’&#10;type IIA theory.) The massive T-duality does indeed relate with Romans’&#10;mass through g\_b=g\_a [qL]{},    m=[2g\_a L]{},    Note the flux&#10;parameter has mass dimension one. The vacua [(\[sol2c\])]{} describes&#10;Lifshitz solution of type IIB theory first obtained by , if we redefine&#10;the coordinates as .&#10;&#10;Note that the axion field has a linear dependence on the circle&#10;coordinate (), where via T-duality. Due to this the axion undergoes&#10;discrete jumps (determined by parameter ) each time it goes around the&#10;circle, as it has to be periodic. One should take with an integral . The&#10;will now effectively count the axions (or the number of D7 branes)&#10;Q\_[D7]{}=[12]{}d=[q]{}[R\_y]{}=w . The D3 charge is given by \[d3q\]&#10;Q\_[D3]{}\~[1\_5]{} G\_[(5)]{} = [2 L\^4 g\_b]{} N taking . Thus the&#10;eq.[(\[sol2c\])]{} describes a bound state of system with wave. The&#10;coordinates and together constitute two transverse directions of D7&#10;branes. It is the same kind of effect which the massive T-duality brings&#10;under which D8-brane of massive type IIA is mapped over to D7-brane in&#10;type IIB and vice-versa . Thus we have confirmed that the Romans type&#10;IIA theory with massive -field admits Lifshitz vacua and it also&#10;provides a consistent T-dual description of the Lifshitz vacua of type&#10;IIB string theory.&#10;&#10;The vacua presented here are different from other Lifshitz vacua&#10;obtained in and gauged/massive supergravities with arbitrary dynamical&#10;exponents in . Those and vacua with (the being sphere, hyperboloid or&#10;flat space) can also be lifted to , but these are different cases.

By constant scaling of the fields the action [(\[eq3g\])]{} can&#10;be brought to a canonical form \[eq3g1\] S\_[4d]{}\~ and corresponding&#10;solution also can be written as [^2] \[sol2vn3\] &amp;&amp;ds\^2=L\^2(-&#10;[dt\^2z\^4]{} +[z\^2L\^4]{}(dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2)+[dz\^2z\^2]{} )&#10;,&amp;&amp;e\^[\_4]{}=g\_0[z\^2L\^2]{},     C\_[(1)]{}= [1g\_0]{}(-[L\^3z\^4]{}&#10;dt - [x\_2L]{} dx\_1 +[x\_1L]{}dx\_2), &amp;&amp; \_[(1)]{}= -[Lz\^2]{}dt  ,&#10;where is coupling constant. The parameter has altogether disappeared&#10;from the solutions [(\[sol2vn3\])]{} and it only determines the coupling&#10;. Since the dilaton runs towards strong coupling in the IR, this&#10;solution gives valid CFT descrition only in the (near UV region). In the&#10;UV region the Lifshitz theory becomes almost free.&#10;&#10;It is tempting to holographically relate the bulk theory [(\[eq3g1\])]{}&#10;to some known nonrelativistic condensed matter phenomenon in a plane on&#10;the boundary, involving two distinct (electrical) charges interacting in&#10;presence of constant magnetic field (or current), somewhat like in&#10;quantum Hall effect. There are no mass terms for gauge fields hence the&#10;solution [(\[sol2vn3\])]{} cannot describe superconducting or higgs&#10;phase. For the bulk solution [(\[sol2vn3\])]{}, the gauge interaction&#10;terms in the action [(\[eq3g1\])]{} is very crucial, but it is of rather&#10;unusual type to motivate. However it is not uncommon for such tensorial&#10;interactions to arise in bulk gravity (string) theory. The massless&#10;gauge-gravity action [(\[eq3g1\])]{} certainly represents a new critical&#10;phenomenon, but it is also related via ‘massive’ T-duality to another&#10;action having massive gauge fields [(\[eq3g1g\])]{} and describing&#10;superconducting phenomenon .&#10;&#10;Next the gauge field specially couples to the dilaton hence it is&#10;distinct as compared to the other gauge field which is totally decoupled&#10;from dilaton in [(\[eq3g1\])]{}. The former may thus have its origin in&#10;the Hall (excitaions) carriers. As we understand from the quantum Hall&#10;effect that, there is a constant magnetic field uniformally spread over&#10;a plane alongwith an electric field (EMF) applied in one (say )&#10;direction of the plane. Consequently a quantized Hall voltage (current)&#10;gets generated along another (here ) direction of the planar system.&#10;From this analogy we understand that can possibly be the source of Hall&#10;charges. In holography, the boundary value of the time-component of bulk&#10;gauge field represents charge sources in boundary. Furthermore, is&#10;essentially a component of string -field (wrapped on circle). Since and&#10;is an important overall parameter. We find that the two gauge potentials&#10;behave as \_0\~O(N\^[14]{}),      C\_0\~O(N\^[34]{})Thus their&#10;respective carrier concentrations would have difference. However if we&#10;compare respective Lorentz invariants in the action involving electric&#10;and magnetic fields, then &amp;&amp;e\^[-2\_4]{}(\_z[A]{}\_0)\^2&#10;\~-[4g\_0\^2L\^6]{}z\^4 ,&amp;&amp;(\_z[ C]{}\_0)\^2\~-[16 g\_0\^2 L\^6 ]{} z\^4&#10;,&amp;&amp;(\_i[ C]{}\_j)\^2\~[4g\_0\^2 L\^6]{} z\^4  . It shows that, though&#10;the electric field contribution of is comparatively weaker by a factor&#10;of , but in the lagrangian [(\[eq3g1\])]{} all gauge terms contribute&#10;with equal strengths due to varied dilatonic couplings. These on-shell&#10;quantities do not diverge near the boundary. Furthermore, in the bulk&#10;solution [(\[sol2vn3\])]{} we can in fact choose a gauge such that&#10;components are only nonvanishing alongwith . This implies existence of&#10;two independent sources of charge (EMF) and an indepedent electric&#10;current in the boundary theory.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The nonrelativisitic phenomenon is expressed by the hamiltonian ,&#10;    and the scaling property [(\[sca3\])]{} implies that the&#10;    quasi-particle masses must scale as . Hence the particle mass&#10;    (number) increases when we probe bigger length scales (or at low&#10;    energy). It should be plausible for a quantum system exhibiting&#10;    negative dynamical exponent for spatial coordinates.&#10;&#10;[^2]: The string metric has a constant negative curvature. It does not&#10;    include curvature singularity.">

  <outline text="Alternative vacua with negative dynamical exponent" _note="It is obvious that the action [(\[eq3g1\])]{} would allow following&#10;Lifshitz vacua where dynamical exponent of time is instead negative&#10;while two spatial coordinates scale positively. Let us define a new&#10;holographic coordinate as \[def5\] u\^2= [L\^4z\^2]{} and by scaling ,&#10;we obtain from [(\[sol2vn3\])]{} a new kind of situation described by&#10;\[sol2vn3o\] &amp;&amp;ds\^2=L\^2(- [ u\^4 dt\^2]{}&#10;+[1u\^2]{}(dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2)+[du\^2u\^2]{} ) ,&amp;&amp;e\^[\_4]{}=g\_0[L\^2&#10;u\^2]{},       C\_[(1)]{}= [1g\_0]{}(-[u\^4 L]{} dt - [x\_2L]{} dx\_1&#10;+[x\_1L]{}dx\_2), &amp;&amp; \_[(1)]{}= -[u\^2 L]{}dt  , which is valid in the&#10;(IR) region. This new looking solution [(\[sol2vn3o\])]{} has negative&#10;dynamical exponent for time (), such that \[sca3o\] &amp;&amp; uu,    t\^[-2]{}&#10;t,   x\_1x\_1,   x\_2x\_2,   &amp;&amp; g\_g\_,   e\^[\_4]{}\^[-2]{} e\^[\_4]{},&#10;     C\^[2]{} C ,    . Note that the string coupling tends to blow up at&#10;shorter length scales (UV), while at longer (IR) scales it becomes&#10;almost a free theory. Thus the Lifshitz background [(\[sol2vn3o\])]{} is&#10;suitable for describing a low energy Lifshitz theory at large length&#10;scales . (While at shorter scales, , the previous background&#10;[(\[sol2vn3\])]{} is more suitable.) In the present case the boundary&#10;field theory may actually describe electrodynamics because coupling&#10;remains weaker at longer distances. [^1] Once again there are two kinds&#10;of (electric) charges interacting with a constant magnetic field such as&#10;in quantum Hall systems near criticality.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The nonrelativisitic phenomenon is expressed by the hamiltonian ,&#10;    and the scaling property [(\[sca3o\])]{} implies that the&#10;    quasi-particle masses must scale as . That is the quasi particle&#10;    mass (number) get reduced when probed at large length scales (or&#10;    with low energy) which appears to be plausible in a quantum system&#10;    exhibiting negative dynamical exponent (for time) and having running&#10;    coupling.">

<outline text="Summary" _note="We have shown that for the Romans’ type IIA supergravity the brane&#10;configuration gives rise to the Lifshitz vacua . For this Lifshitz&#10;solution the fundamental strings have to be massive with , and such that&#10;and . A compactification of the massive type IIA theory on relates&#10;-dimensional background with corresponding Scherk-Schwarz reduced type&#10;IIB Lifshitz vacua compactified on a dual circle. This duality map is&#10;known as ‘massive’ T-duality . It has been known in litrature that&#10;spacetime is constituted by axion-flux system in type IIB string theory.&#10;The presence of D7-branes primarily requires constant axion flux&#10;switched on along in these solutions. None of these solutions preserve&#10;any supersymmetry.&#10;&#10;Further, using ‘massive’ T-duality symmetry in eight dimensions, we have&#10;related the Lifshitz vacua in Romans theory to yet another vacua which&#10;is constituted by brane system of ordinary type IIA theory. But these&#10;latter vacua have negative dynamical exponents along two CFT directions.&#10;The interesting observation is that this solution upon exlicit&#10;compactification along gives rise to Lifshitz vacua with two distinct&#10;types of electric charges supported by a constant magnetic flux (or&#10;current), all entirely living over plane at the boundary. We speculate&#10;that this may represent phenomena akin to quantum Hall systems. We also&#10;have obtained M-theory uplift of the Lifshitz solutions.&#10;&#10;I am thankful to the ICTP, Trieste for the associateship support and the&#10;ASC-LMU, Munich for kind hospitality where parts of this work are&#10;carried out.&#10;&#10;[99]{} J. M. Maldacena, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys.  [**2**]{}, 231 (1998)&#10;\[Int. J. Theor. Phys.  [**38**]{}, 1113 (1999)\]&#10;\[arXiv:hep-th/9711200\].
