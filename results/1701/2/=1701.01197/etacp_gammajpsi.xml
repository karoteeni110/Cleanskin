    <title>Measurement of higher-order multipole amplitudes in with and search for
the transition</title>
    <abstract>Using 106 million events collected with the BESIII detector, we measure
multipole amplitudes for the decay beyond the dominant electric-dipole
amplitudes. The normalized magnetic-quadrupole amplitude for and the
normalized electric-octupole amplitudes for ,  are determined. The M2
amplitudes for and are found to differ significantly from zero and are
consistent with theoretical predictions. We also obtain the ratios of M2
contributions of and decays to , and , which agree well with theoretical
expectations. By considering the multipole contributions of , we measure
the product branching fractions for the cascade decays and search for
the process through . The product branching fraction for is 3 larger
than published measurements, while those of are consistent. No
significant signal for the decay is observed, and the upper limit of the
product branching fraction at the 90% confidence level is determined. </abstract>

<outline text="BESIII detector and Monte Carlo simulation" _note="The BESIII detector is described in detail in Ref. . It is an&#10;approximately cylindrically symmetric detector which covers 93% of the&#10;solid angle around the collision point. The detector consists of four&#10;main components: (a) a 43-layer main drift chamber provides a momentum&#10;resolution of 0.5% for charged tracks at 1 GeV/ in a 1 T magnetic field;&#10;(b) a time-of-flight system (TOF) is constructed of plastic&#10;scintillators with a time resolution of 80 ps (110 ps) in the barrel&#10;(end caps); (c) a 6240 cell CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter&#10;(EMC) provides an energy resolution for photons of 3.0% (5.0%) around&#10;0.3 GeV in the barrel (end caps) ; (d) a muon counter consisting of nine&#10;(eight) layers of resistive plate chambers in the barrel (end caps)&#10;within the return yoke of the magnet with a position resolution of 2 cm&#10;provides muon/pion separation. A [geant4]{}  based detector simulation&#10;package has been developed to model the detector response used in Monte&#10;Carlo (MC) generated events.&#10;&#10;A MC simulated sample of 106 million generic decays (“inclusive MC”) is&#10;used for general background studies. The resonances are produced by the&#10;event generator [Kkmc]{} . The known decays are generated by&#10;[BesEvtGen]{}  with branching fractions taken from the PDG , while the&#10;remaining decays are generated according to the [Lundcharm]{} model .&#10;Exclusive MC samples for signal decays are generated to optimize the&#10;selection criteria and to determine the detection efficiencies. The&#10;decays are generated with angular distributions determined from data,&#10;and the decay is generated according to the [Helamp]{} model in&#10;[EvtGen]{} . To estimate the background contributions from decays, the&#10;exclusive MC samples are generated according to the [Helamp]{},&#10;[Jpipi]{} , and [Phsp]{} models, respectively. To investigate QED&#10;processes backgrounds, radiative Bhabha and dimuon events () simulated&#10;with [Babayaga V3.5]{} , as well as and produced by [Kkmc]{} , are used&#10;together with the experimental data at 3.773 GeV.">

<outline text="Event selection" _note="The signal decay consists of two charged tracks and two photons. Events&#10;with exactly two oppositely charged tracks and from two up to four&#10;photon candidates are selected. Charged tracks are required to originate&#10;from the run-dependent interaction point within in the direction&#10;perpendicular to and within along the beam axis and should lie within&#10;the polar angular region of . The momentum of each track must be larger&#10;than 1 GeV/. The energy deposit in the EMC and of each track are used to&#10;identify muon or electron candidates. Tracks with GeV are taken as&#10;muons, and those with are identified as electrons. Events with both&#10;tracks identified as muons or electrons are accepted for further&#10;analysis. Photons are reconstructed from isolated showers in the EMC,&#10;where the angle between the positions in the EMC of the photon and the&#10;closest charged track is required to be larger than deg. The energy&#10;deposited in the EMC is corrected by the energy loss in nearby TOF&#10;counters to improve the reconstruction efficiency and the energy&#10;resolution. The energy of each photon shower is required to be larger&#10;than 25 MeV. The shower timing information is required to be in&#10;coincidence with the event start time with a requirement of  ns to&#10;suppress electronic noise and showers unrelated to the event.&#10;&#10;A four-constraint (4C) kinematic fit is performed for the two lepton&#10;candidates and all possible two photon combinations with the initial&#10;4-momentum as a constraint. If more than one combination is found in one&#10;event, the one with the smallest value is kept.

In addition, to&#10;remove and backgrounds, events with an invariant mass of the photon pair&#10;in the regions  GeV/ or  GeV/ are rejected.

<outline text="Systematic uncertainties" _note="The main sources of systematic uncertainty for the measurements of&#10;higher-order multipole amplitudes are the uncertainties in the&#10;efficiency, the kinematic fit procedure, the fit procedure of the&#10;combined angular distributions, statistical fluctuations of the MC&#10;sample, and the background contamination.&#10;&#10;A simulated sample of events distributed uniformly in [PHSP]{} is used&#10;to normalize the function . A difference of detection efficiencies&#10;between the MC sample and the data will result in a shift in the&#10;measurement, which is taken as the systematic uncertainty. From the&#10;studies of the tracking efficiency for electrons and muons with the&#10;control samples of decays, and the photon efficiency with the control&#10;samples from decays and radiative dimuon events, the difference in the&#10;detection efficiencies between the data and MC is found to be polar&#10;angle dependent with the largest value , which may change the helicity&#10;angular distribution. The corresponding effect on the higher-order&#10;multipole measurement is estimated by varying the efficiency with an&#10;asymmetric function of and as \[which corresponds to a 0.9% (0.3%)&#10;difference for (1); is the polar angle for one photon, and is for one&#10;charged track\]. Twice the difference with respect to the nominal result&#10;is taken as a systematic uncertainty. For the kinematic fit, the track&#10;helix parameters are corrected to reduce the difference in the&#10;distribution between the data and the MC simulation according to the&#10;procedure described in Refs. . These [PHSP]{} MC samples without and&#10;with the helix correction are used to normalize , respectively, and the&#10;resultant difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty.&#10;&#10;To estimate the uncertainty from the fit procedure, 200 MC samples using&#10;the high-order multipole amplitudes are generated, followed by a&#10;complete detector simulation. Each sample has 165 thousand (90 thousand)&#10;selected events for , and the same multipole analysis procedure is&#10;applied for each sample. The differences in () between the input and&#10;fitted values are Gaussian distributed. The mean values of the Gaussians&#10;are , () and are taken as the systematic uncertainty. The statistics of&#10;the MC sample for the normalization, about 3.6 (1.8) million events, may&#10;affect the fit results. For the normalization function,&#10;Eq.(\[normal\_func\]), the variance for is&#10;&#10;\[square\_de\_a1\]&#10;&#10;The standard deviation for each coefficient is . The largest change in&#10;parameters and by varying the coefficient by for the channel (, and for&#10;the channel) is taken as the systematic uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The main backgrounds for the channel come from , which contribute about&#10;0.7% of the candidates according to a MC study. For the channel, the&#10;main backgrounds come from , and the contribution is about 1%. In the&#10;nominal fit, the contribution of background is estimated by the&#10;inclusive MC samples. To estimate the systematic uncertainty,&#10;high-statistics MC samples for backgrounds are generated to redetermine&#10;the shape and the contribution according to previous measurements . The&#10;difference in the fit results is taken as the systematic uncertainty.&#10;All the systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table \[chicJ\_sys\].&#10;The total systematic uncertainties are calculated by adding the&#10;individual values in quadrature, thereby assuming that they are&#10;independent.&#10;&#10;The systematic uncertainties of the branching fractions measurement&#10;include uncertainties from the number of events (0.9%) , the tracking&#10;efficiency (0.1% per lepton) , the photon detection efficiency (1.0% per&#10;photon) , the kinematic fit, the mass window, the other selection&#10;criteria (, veto and , particle identification, ), the branching&#10;fraction of (0.6%) , the interference between and nonresonant processes,&#10;and the fitting procedure.&#10;&#10;The uncertainty from the kinematic fit is estimated by the same&#10;procedure as described in the multipole amplitude measurements. To&#10;estimate the uncertainty caused by the mass requirement, a control&#10;sample in the region GeV/ is used. For data, the only background is from&#10;, which is determined in fitting with the exclusive MC shape. The&#10;efficiency of selection (3.08,3.12) GeV is evaluated by comparing the&#10;number of signal events before and after the requirement, and the&#10;corresponding difference between the data and MC sample is 0.6% for the&#10;channel and 0.1% for the channel. To be conservative, we take 0.6% as&#10;the systematic uncertainty. With the same sample, the systematic&#10;uncertainties related to the selection criteria , veto, veto, and&#10;leptons identification are also determined. The overall difference in&#10;the efficiency between the data and MC sample for these criteria is 1.6%&#10;and is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The additional systematic&#10;uncertainty due to the polar angle selection for the channel is&#10;determined by varying the selection with and fitting simultaneously&#10;again. The largest changes on the fit results are taken as the&#10;systematic uncertainty.&#10;&#10;To estimate the possible uncertainty from the interference between and ,&#10;we repeat the simultaneous fit, taking the interference into account.&#10;The interference phase is found to be . The changes in the signal yields&#10;are taken as the systematic uncertainty. Since the signal shapes are&#10;determined from MC simulation, the corresponding systematic uncertainty&#10;is estimated by an alternative fit with varying the mass and width of&#10;with of the world average values  for the signal MC shape. To estimate&#10;the uncertainty due to the background of and the ratio of for Bhabha and&#10;dimuon backgrounds, alternative fits are performed in which the numbers&#10;of expected background events (see Table \[eff\]) and the ratio of are&#10;varied by . For , the largest differences in the signal yields from the&#10;nominal values are taken as the systematic uncertainty. For the case, to&#10;be conservative, the one corresponding to the largest upper limit is&#10;taken as the final result. All systematic uncertainties of the different&#10;sources are summarized in Table \[sys\_all\]. The total systematic&#10;uncertainties are obtained by adding the individual ones in quadrature,&#10;thereby assuming all these sources are independent.">

The results in this measurement will provide a&#10;guidance for the theoretical calculations.&#10;&#10;\&#10;&#10;We also search for the decay through . No statistically significant&#10;signal is observed. Considering the systematic uncertainty, an upper&#10;limit on the product branching fraction is determined to be at the 90%&#10;C.L., where the systematic uncertainty is incorporated by a factor for&#10;conservative. Combining the result of obtained by BESIII , the upper&#10;limit of the branching fraction for is at the 90% C.L. Using the width&#10;of of  MeV/ , our upper limit implies a partial width of 0.50 MeV/.&#10;Although this result agrees with the prediction of LQCD (0.0013 MeV/) ,&#10;it clearly has a very limited sensitivity to rigorously test the theory.&#10;&#10;The BESIII Collaboration thanks the staff of BEPCII and the Institute of&#10;High Energy Physics computing center for their strong support.
