    <title>On the discrepancy between best and uniform approximation</title>
    <abstract>For a transcendental real number, we consider the classical Diophantine
exponents and . They measure how small can be for an integer polynomial
of degree at most and naive height bounded by , for arbitrarily large
and all large , respectively. The discrepancy between the exponents and
has attracted interest recently. Studying parametric geometry of
numbers, W. Schmidt and L. Summerer were the first to refine the trivial
inequality . Y. Bugeaud and the author found another estimation provided
that the condition holds. In this paper we establish an unconditional
version of the latter result, which can be regarded as a proper
extension. Unfortunately, the new contribution involves an additional
exponent and is of interest only in certain cases. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Let be a positive integer and be a transcendental real number. For a&#10;polynomial as usual let denote its height, which is the maximum modulus&#10;among the coefficients of . We want to investigate relations between the&#10;two classical exponents of Diophantine approximation and introduced&#10;below. Define as the supremum of such that has a solution of degree at&#10;most for arbitrarily large values of . Similarly, let be the supremum of&#10;such that has a solution of degree at most for [ALL]{} large . The&#10;interest of the exponent in and the derived exponents arises partly from&#10;the relation to approximation to a real number by algebraic numbers of&#10;bounded degree. Indeed, when is an algebraic number very close to , then&#10;the evaluation is also very small by absolute value, for the irreducible&#10;minimal polynomial of over . More precisely for a constant that depends&#10;only on and the degree of . The converse is a delicate problem, at least&#10;for certain numbers , related to the famous problem of Wirsing posed&#10;in . We do not further discuss this issue here and only affirm that&#10;results involving the exponents typically imply comparable results&#10;concerning approximation by algebraic numbers in an obvious way. For any&#10;real number , our exponents clearly satisfy the relations Dirichlet’s&#10;box principle further implies The value can be infinity. In this case is&#10;called a -number, more precisely is called -number if is the smallest&#10;such index. The existence of -numbers for any was first proved by&#10;LeVeque . On the other hand, the quantities can be effectively bounded.&#10;For , it is not hard to see that we always have , see . For , Davenport&#10;and Schmidt  showed Roy  proved that for certain numbers he called&#10;[EXTREMAL NUMBERS]{} there is equality, so is sharp. For an overview of&#10;the results on the values attained for real , see . For , little is&#10;known about the exponents . The supremum of the values over all real&#10;real numbers remains unknown in this case, in fact even the existence of&#10;a real number with the property is open. The first result in this&#10;direction was due to Davenport and Schmidt , who showed for any real .&#10;Recently this bound has been refined in and further in , in the latter&#10;paper the currently best known bound was established. The right hand&#10;side is of order as . Conditionally on a conjecture of Schmidt and&#10;Summerer , small improvements of can be obtained with the method in .

  <outline text="The main result" _note="Investigating parametric geometry of numbers introduced by them, Schmidt&#10;and Summerer  found the estimate for the minimum discrepancy between and&#10;, for any transcendental real . Rearrangements lead to the equivalent&#10;formulation In fact analogous estimates were established in the more&#10;general context of linear forms with respect to any given real vector&#10;that is -linearly independent together with , and in this case they are&#10;sharp for any dimension and parameter, see Roy . The above estimates&#10;yield a proper improvement of the obvious left inequality in unless . A&#10;non-trivial identity case occurs for and an extremal number as defined&#10;in Section \[sek1\]. See also for an improvement of when , and a&#10;conjecture concerning the optimal bound for arbitrary . A special case&#10;of the recent  complements .&#10;&#10;\[Bugeaud, Schleischitz\] \[bugsch\] Let be integers and be a&#10;transcendental real number. Then in case of we have&#10;&#10;Observe that in contrast to , the bound in for decreases as increases.&#10;For and any Sturmian continued fraction, see  for a definition, there is&#10;equality in . This can be verified by inserting the exact values of and&#10;determined in the main result of . In particular, for extremal numbers&#10;mentioned above we have equality in both and when .&#10;&#10;The condition in Theorem \[bugsch\] was used predominately to guarantee&#10;that the polynomials in the definition of have degree precisely (in the&#10;special case of   reproduced in Theorem \[bugsch\]). In other words, for&#10;any , there are arbitrarily large irreducible integer polynomials of&#10;degree exactly for which the estimate holds. This was a crucial&#10;observation for the proof. We point out that this property does not hold&#10;in general, i.e. when we drop the condition . Indeed, using continued&#10;fraction expansion, one can even construct real numbers for which the&#10;degree of any which satisfies equals one, when is sufficiently small.&#10;This can be deduced from the proof of . It is unknown whether still&#10;holds when we drop the condition . The purpose of this paper is to&#10;provide a weaker but unconditioned relation. We will agree on in our&#10;following main result.&#10;&#10;\[nn\] Let be a positive integer and be a real transcendental number.&#10;Let be the smallest integer such that . Then the estimation holds.&#10;&#10;\[rehmark\] In case of , the trivial estimate in implies . More&#10;generally, when does not exceed by much, the Schmidt-Summerer bound is&#10;even smaller than both bounds in .&#10;&#10;The left bound in will be an easy consequence of Theorem \[lutz\] from&#10;reproduced below, the main new contribution is the right bound. When ,&#10;by definition of we have and the right bound in the minimum in becomes ,&#10;which is trivial in view of . Thus Theorem \[nn\] is of interest&#10;primarily when and . However, if these relations hold and does not&#10;exceed by much, then one checks that the right expression in the minimum&#10;in is the smaller one. In general, the new right bound in is of interest&#10;when is rather close to and is relatively small, whereas is large. For ,&#10;the bound in becomes , and we recover Theorem \[bugsch\]. The expression&#10;involved in is unpleasant, as it can be arbitrarily close to . We would&#10;like to replace it by , which could be effectively bounded with by&#10;roughly . The proof will suggest that such improvements are realistic.">

  <outline text="-numbers" _note="The claim of Theorem \[nn\] is of particular interest when is a -number&#10;(see Section \[sek1\]). In that case, in  it was deduced essentially&#10;from the generalization  of Theorem \[bugsch\] that , and moreover We&#10;remark that  rephrased in Theorem \[lutz\] below provides another proof&#10;of . We can now refine this estimate when is roughly between and .&#10;&#10;\[jawasdenn\] Let be integers and be a -number. Then&#10;&#10;By assumption we have , where we agree on if . Thus we may apply&#10;Theorem \[nn\] with , which yields the claimed bound.&#10;&#10;As indicated, the possible gain by the replacement of by in the minimum&#10;can only occur when is not too large compared to . More precisely is a&#10;necessary condition by . On the other hand, when is a -number and is&#10;small for some , then Corollary \[jawasdenn\] yields a significant&#10;improvement for . It is reasonable that even -numbers with the property&#10;for exist. For this is true, using continued fraction expansion one can&#10;even construct a -number with any prescribed value . See  and its&#10;preceding remarks. However, for -numbers we do not get any new insight&#10;from Theorem \[nn\]. Concerning -numbers of larger index, Alniaçik &#10;showed the existence of uncountably many -numbers of arbitrary index&#10;with the property . (In  the analogous result for -numbers is proposed,&#10;however as pointed out by Bugeaud in  crucial estimates in  are not&#10;carried out properly and serious revision of the paper is required.) For&#10;such -numbers, the succeeding uniform exponent can be bounded with&#10;Corollary \[jawasdenn\] as For large , this leads to a reasonable&#10;improvement compared to the trivial bound from . Moreover, Alniaçiks&#10;main theorem in  seems to allow one to construct -numbers with arbitrary&#10;prescribed value , thus extending the result for -numbers above. Indeed,&#10;it suffices to take (in fact rather in the classical notation of&#10;continued fractions where for the partial quotients and the convergents,&#10;this seems to be a minor inaccuracy in ) and let the remaining (i.e. not&#10;of the form ) in the formulation of the theorem. Elementary facts on&#10;continued fractions and Roth’s Theorem imply . Strangely, this&#10;observation seems not to have been previously mentioned. As soon as ,&#10;the resulting bound again improves the trivial upper bound .&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the larger intermediate exponents are hard to control&#10;for a -number. A construction of Schmidt  shows that it is possible to&#10;obtain simultaneously for for some -number . This refined an earlier&#10;result of Alniaçik, Avci and Bugeaud . However, this estimation is not&#10;sufficient to improve the previously known bound with&#10;Corollary \[jawasdenn\]. Finally, we point out that -numbers which allow&#10;arbitrarily good irreducible polynomial evaluations of some degree as&#10;well satisfy . By the condition more precisely we mean that the exponent&#10;in can be chosen arbitrarily large among polynomials of degree and&#10;additionally among irreducible polynomials of degree . Indeed, the&#10;second expression in the right hand estimate in can be dropped in this&#10;case, as can be seen from the proof below.">

<outline text="Proof of Theorem [nn]" _note="We reproduce some results from  for the proof. The first is , which&#10;essentially implies the left bound in .&#10;&#10;\[lutz\] Let be positive integers and be a transcendental real number.&#10;Then&#10;&#10;Theorem \[lutz\] was recently refined  by replacing the right hand side&#10;by , for the classic exponent of uniform simultaneous rational&#10;approximation to for a real number . See for example  for an exact&#10;definition. We will further directly apply the following , a&#10;generalization of  by Davenport and Schmidt, which was the core of the&#10;proof of both Theorem \[bugsch\] and Theorem \[lutz\]. We write in the&#10;sequel when exceeds at most by a constant that depends on the subscript&#10;variables.&#10;&#10;\[kastner\] Let be two coprime integer polynomials of degree and ,&#10;respectively. Further let be any real number. Then at least one of the&#10;estimates holds. In particular&#10;&#10;In the formulation of the lemma we dropped the condition stated in ,&#10;which is not required as pointed out to me by D. Roy. We further point&#10;out that Wirsing  showed that for any there exists a constant , such&#10;that uniformly for all polynomials of degree at most holds. He deduced&#10;that the polynomials within the definition of can be chosen irreducible.&#10;Moreover it follows from the definition of the exponents that in the&#10;case of these irreducible polynomials have degree precisely . This fact&#10;was already an essential ingredient in the proof of , which is our&#10;Theorem \[bugsch\].&#10;&#10;\[Proof of Theorem \[nn\]\] First assume . Then by clearly as well.&#10;Moreover, it is easy to check that the right bound in exceeds , see also&#10;Remark \[rehmark\]. Hence we can restrict to . We will further assume&#10;for simplicity. The case can be treated very similarly by considering&#10;the polynomials for which tends to infinity.&#10;&#10;By the choice of we have . Hence, as carried out above, for any there&#10;exist infinitely many irreducible integer polynomials of degree&#10;precisely such that Fix one such irreducible of large height and small&#10;to be chosen later and let We want to give a lower bound on for an&#10;arbitrary integer polynomial of degree at most and height . We&#10;distinguish two cases.&#10;&#10;Case 1: The polynomial is not a polynomial multiple of . Then are&#10;coprime as is irreducible, and thus we may apply Lemma \[kastner\].&#10;First assume . Then we infer The upper bound follows for such as we may&#10;choose and arbitrarily small, and doing so the right hand side in tends&#10;to , whereas the remaining expression in is non-negative. Now assume .&#10;Then yields&#10;&#10;First assume . Then Lemma \[kastner\] yields This contradicts for&#10;sufficiently large and sufficiently small , by our hypothesis . Hence&#10;must hold. Then Lemma \[kastner\] implies where . Combination with&#10;yields hence This contradicts our assumption , which is equivalent to ,&#10;when is chosen small enough compared to . This contraction finishes the&#10;proof of case 1.&#10;&#10;Case 2: The integer polynomial is of the form for some integer&#10;polynomial . The degree of is at most since has degree at most and has&#10;degree precisely . Moreover from Wirsing’s estimate we infer Let be&#10;small. By definition of , for a variation of (that tends to as does) and&#10;for sufficiently large , all but finitely many satisfy We briefly&#10;discuss the possible exceptions for the given . By the finiteness and&#10;transcendence of we infer an absolute lower bound . Thus for we have .&#10;The bound follows similarly to as and . Now we treat the main case of&#10;that satisfy . Together with and Wirsing’s estimate we obtain We&#10;conclude As we may choose and arbitrarily small, we obtain for&#10;arbitrarily small . Inserting the value of from we obtain The right&#10;bound in follows with elementary rearrangements. Since this holds for&#10;any polynomial multiple of of height , the proof of case 2 is finished&#10;as well.&#10;&#10;The author thanks the anonymous referee for the careful reading.&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;K.
