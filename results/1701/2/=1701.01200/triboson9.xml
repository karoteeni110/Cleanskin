    <title> A renormalization method for three-boson system with a triboson field</title>
    <abstract>A renormalization method that introduces an auxiliary field to represent
a three-body bound state is studied in a three-boson system with a
triboson field. A cutoff dependence in the three-boson system emerges as
a limit cycle, and the cyclic singularity is renormalized by employing
two methods: a standard method and the auxiliary field method. For each
method, different sets of diagrams are involved for renormalization, and
thus we numerically study three quantities: counter term for
renormalization, scattering length of -wave boson-diboson scattering,
and normalized wavefunction. We confirm that the two methods would lead
to the same result. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The studies of three-body systems in pionless effective field theory&#10;(EFT) revealed a nontrivial feature of the systems. That is an&#10;appearance of a cyclic singularity, known as a limit cycle, in a&#10;three-boson system  and a three-nucleon system in triton channel . A&#10;three-body contact interaction, whose order is naively counted as that&#10;in higher order, is promoted to leading order (LO) for renormalization&#10;of the singularity. The appearance of the limit cycle is accompanied by&#10;emergence of bound states, known as Efimov states, in the unitary&#10;limit . For recent studies of the three-nucleon systems in triton and He&#10;channels, one may refer to Refs. . (For general reviews of the pionless&#10;EFT, one may refer to Refs. .) This feature is also applied to the&#10;studies of the various systems, e.g., halo-nuclei  and hyper-nuclei .&#10;&#10;One of the issues of the three-nucleon systems in pionless EFT is to&#10;establish a rigorous perturbative method to expand an amplitude in terms&#10;of effective range terms because the major part of the previous works&#10;employed an approximation so called partially resummed approach . A&#10;fully perturbative method for a calculation of scattering in pionless&#10;EFT was suggested by Vanasse. However, it is not easy to apply the&#10;method to a study involving a bound state . Recently, the same author&#10;suggested a new method to deal with a bound state perturbatively by&#10;introducing a tribaryon field, which represents the bound state of&#10;triton, and the method was applied to a calculation of charge radius of&#10;the triton up to next-to-next-to-leading order .&#10;&#10;This new method introduces an auxiliary field which represents a bound&#10;state of a three-body system. A dressed three-body propagator is&#10;constructed by using the auxiliary field, and a coupling constant of the&#10;auxiliary field is determined so that a pole position of the three-body&#10;binding energy is reproduced in the dressed three-body propagator. An&#10;advantage of the new method is that it is not necessary to numerically&#10;fit the coupling constant of the three-body part by employing Newton’s&#10;method. The method has originally been introduced by Hagen et al., and&#10;they applied it to the study of electric form factor of two-neutron halo&#10;systems .&#10;&#10;In this short report, we study the renormalization method suggested by&#10;Hagen et al. by employing a simple system, three neutral scalar boson&#10;system of equal masses with a triboson field. Using a simple system is&#10;beneficial to a study of the renormalization method itself since it&#10;avoids detailed calculations. The system exhibits a limit cycle, thus a&#10;sharp momentum cutoff is introduced in an integral equation for the&#10;three-boson system, and a value of a three-body coupling is determined&#10;as functions of by employing two methods: a standard method and the&#10;auxiliary field method. In the two methods, as to be discussed in detail&#10;later, sets of diagrams involved in the scattering amplitude are the&#10;same. However, those for renormalization and calculations of a&#10;normalized wavefunction are different. So it would be worth confirming&#10;that the two different methods lead to an identical result. We then&#10;numerically calculate scattering length of -wave boson-diboson&#10;scattering and normalized wavefunctions, and we confirm that the two&#10;method would lead to the same result.&#10;&#10;This work is organized as following. In Sec. 2, an effective Lagrangian&#10;for a three-boson system with a triboson field is displayed, and in Sec.&#10;3, two-body and three-body parts of an equation for the three-body&#10;system are constructed from the Lagrangian for the two renormalization&#10;methods. In Sec. 4, numerical results are obtained, and finally in Sec.&#10;5, results and discussion of the work are presented.">

In addition,&#10;we employ standard counting rules in pionless EFT for two and three-body&#10;systems . Here we consider LO contributions only. Thus we employ a&#10;simple Lagrangian for the three-boson system including diboson and&#10;triboson fields as  &amp;=&amp; \^( i\_0 + \^2 ) +\&#10;&amp;&amp; + d\^\_d d - 12 y\_d (d\^+ \^\^d) +\&#10;&amp;&amp; + t\^\_t t - y\_t (t\^d+ d\^\^t) + , where , , and are boson,&#10;diboson, and triboson fields, respectively, and is the boson mass.

In SM, one has -loop diagrams with&#10;from the homogeneous part of the integral equation in Eq. (\[eq;t\]),&#10;and a value of is numerically searched by using Newton’s method at the&#10;point where the determinant of the matrix vanishes with .

In&#10;addition, even though the diagrams involving in the two renormalization&#10;methods are different, we obtained the same curves of for SM and AM.&#10;&#10;In Fig. \[fig;BvsLam\], we plot curves of first and second binding&#10;energies, and , which appear due to the limit cycle in the amplitudes&#10;and and the dressed vertex function , as functions of .&#10;&#10;Because the first binding energy appearing in the amplitude is used as&#10;input for renormalization in SM, we have a horizontal line which&#10;corresponds to  MeV. A curve of second binding energy,  GeV, in the&#10;amplitude appears almost flat and starts around  MeV. One can expect&#10;that such a deep binding energy will not affect physics at low energies.&#10;Meanwhile, one may be concerned that the system can decay into the&#10;deeply bound state once it is formed. Thus one may choose an upper limit&#10;of the cutoff value less than  GeV for the present system.&#10;&#10;In AM, the position of the binding energy is reproduced in the&#10;propagator due to the renormalization, whereas bound states are created&#10;in the other parts, and , of the amplitude due to the limit cycle.

Because the kernel of the integral&#10;equation depends on the energy, a normalization condition of the&#10;wavefunction becomes nontrivial . For a wavefunction , which satisfies&#10;an equation , one has a normalization condition of the wavefunction as &#10;|D ( D\^[-1]{} - K ) D|= 1, where . In our case, the operators and are&#10;realized as in Eq. (\[eq;Dd\]), and K K(p,l;E) = ( ), and thus we have a&#10;normalization condition of the wavefunction as &amp;&amp; \^\_0 dll\^2 ( )\^2\&#10;&amp;&amp; - \^\_0 dl’l’\^2 \^\_0 dll\^2\&#10;&amp;&amp; = 1, where is a wavefunction of the bound state obtained in SM.&#10;&#10;A normalized wavefunction is obtained from the dressed vertex function&#10;for AM as  \_[A]{}(p) = -Y\_t(p,-B\_3), \[eq;WF\] where we have included&#10;an overall minus sign in the expression above so as to obtain a positive&#10;value of the wavefunction at . is the wavefunction normalization factor&#10;of the dressed triboson field and is obtained from the propagator in&#10;Eq. (\[eq;t-propagator\]). Thus one has Z\_t = - , where . We note that&#10;the wavefunction does not depend on , which is used for normalization in&#10;Eq. (\[eq;BM\]). In addition, does not depend on either because the&#10;coupling is cancelled between those in the vertex and the normalization&#10;factor . Thus one cannot make the wavefunction cutoff independence by&#10;adjusting the parameters, and . Furthermore, a part of the amplitude, ,&#10;which exhibits a limit cycle and generates bound states in it, is not&#10;included in the calculation of . It might be interesting to examine if&#10;the wavefunction can be cutoff-independence (in other words, if the&#10;limit cycle in can be cancelled with that in the wavefunction&#10;normalization factor ) along with whether is the identical to or not.&#10;&#10;In Figs. \[fig;Yts\] and \[fig;WFs\], we plot curves of the dressed&#10;vertex function and those of normalized wavefunctions , respectively, as&#10;functions of relative momentum using various cutoff values from 300 to&#10;3000 MeV for AM where we have used  MeV for .&#10;&#10;As seen in Fig. \[fig;Yts\], overall factors of the curves of show a&#10;cutoff-dependence, whereas one can see in Fig. \[fig;WFs\] that the&#10;cutoff dependence in the overall factor of disappears in the normalized&#10;wavefunction .

<outline text="Discussion and conclusions" _note="In the present work, we have studied the auxiliary field renormalization&#10;method suggested by Hagen et al. employing a three-boson system with a&#10;triboson field. We numerically calculated the coupling of the three-body&#10;contact interaction for renormalization, the scattering length of -wave&#10;boson-diboson scattering, and the normalized wavefunctions as functions&#10;of the cutoff employing the two renormalization methods, SM and AM. We&#10;confirm that the three-body system exhibits a limit cycle, and the&#10;cyclic singularity can be renormalized by using the both methods. Though&#10;the different diagrams are involved for renormalization in those two&#10;methods, we obtained the identical result for the renormalized coupling&#10;constant of the three-body contact interaction as well as the scattering&#10;length . In addition, we find that the normalized wavefunctions turned&#10;out to be cutoff independent, however, we obtained the different overall&#10;factors of the normalized wavefunctions in the two methods.&#10;&#10;It may be interesting to point out that even though the detailed&#10;diagrams involving in the two renormalization methods and the&#10;calculation methods are different, the results of the renormalization of&#10;the coupling constants turned out to be the same. Thus, because the&#10;diagrams for the scattering amplitude and the renormalized coupling are&#10;the same for SM and AM, it is natural to obtain the same scattering&#10;length , in which the limit cycle is renormalized, for the both methods.&#10;On the other hand, the parts of the scattering lengths , and , for AM&#10;are indeed sensitive to the cutoff and exhibit the limit cycle.&#10;&#10;For the normalized wavefunction , it is also interesting to point out&#10;that it is not necessary to renormalize and fix the parameter in the&#10;dressed triboson propagator .
