<outline text="The longitudinal correlation function" _note="Let us start from the expression of the free energy of a glass state,&#10;prepared by equilibrating a generic glass former down to a glass&#10;transition temperature where it can still be equilibrated, and then&#10;quenching it out of equilibrium to a given temperature . Such a free&#10;energy was first defined in  in the context of spin-glass physics. Its&#10;definition in the case of structural glasses, and its computation in the&#10;particular case of hard spheres were first discussed in . The&#10;definition, in the case of a generic glass former made of particles is&#10;based on comparing two configurations and of the same glass. Here where&#10;the labeling refers to the position of the same particle in the two&#10;different configurations. For a generic interaction potential the&#10;definition of the free energy is where , and is the value of whereupon&#10;the free energy attains a local minimum . The overlap function for any&#10;two configuration, say and is  Here is a coarse graining parameter (in ,&#10;in Lennard-Jones units). The idea is to consider the free energy at&#10;temperature of the glass former, which is CONSTRAINED to stay close to&#10;an amorphous configuration which is selected from the equilibrium&#10;ensemble, using the canonical distribution when the glass is still at&#10;equilibrium at .&#10;&#10;The properties and computation of the free energy are discussed&#10;extensively in , so we refer the interested reader to those works. The&#10;explicit analytic computation is accomplished in the mean field&#10;approximation. In our paper we use the results far from the mean field&#10;limit, but we ascertain that the relevant correlation functions that are&#10;fleshed out in the mean field calculation are the relevant ones also in&#10;the general case. Of course, critical exponents can differ. In the&#10;sequel we sketch how from this mean-field theory in terms of an overlap&#10;order parameter one can extract the definitions of the correlation&#10;functions that are expected to show critical behavior.&#10;&#10;The outermost integral in the Eq.  can be computed with the replica&#10;trick, where is defined as so we are considering replicas of the&#10;configuration. In infinite dimensions for the case of hard spheres it&#10;was shown  that the functional defined above can be written as Here&#10;denotes an integration measure over all the distinct s, and is the&#10;number of spatial dimensions. The functional is referred to as the&#10;“replica action&quot;. In the mean-field limit , the integral above can be&#10;computed via the saddle point method , which means that one must&#10;consider the optimum points in of the replica action . This means that&#10;plays the role of a GIBBS FREE ENERGY, i.e. the free energy for fixed&#10;order parameter. An illustrative example is the case of a Curie-Weiss&#10;model (mean-field ferromagnet) wherein, for the Helmholtz free energy in&#10;zero magnetic field, one has  where is indeed the Gibbs free energy for&#10;fixed magnetization . The minimization equation for is then the&#10;celebrated equation for the spontaneous magnetization and the&#10;ferromagnetic phase transition takes place when the paramagnetic,&#10;minimum of flattens and splits in two degenerate minima with , which&#10;implies that at the critical temperature . The derivation of the action&#10;in the case of mean-field hard spheres can be found in .&#10;&#10;In the present case the plays the role of the Helmholtz free energy and&#10;the of the Gibbs free energy . With this analogy, one can understand how&#10;the critical properties of glass states are related to the matrix of&#10;second derivatives of the replica action , in the limit (we stress that&#10;is not involved in this definition). The inverse of the tensor , defined&#10;as is then the covariance matrix of the mean field theory wherein the&#10;angled brackets denote the thermal average restricted to a single glass&#10;sample at temperature (that is over the canonical distribution of the&#10;configuration in the ), and the overbar denotes the average over all&#10;possible glass samples selected at (that is over the canonical&#10;distribution of the configuration in the ). This covariance tensor&#10;encodes the critical fluctuations of the system near the critical points&#10;whereupon the tensor develops a zero mode.&#10;&#10;Let us now assume that the glass state under study is a single minimum&#10;of the free-energy landscape of the system wherein all replicas from to&#10;can move ergodically, this means that the replicas are all equivalent&#10;and the matrix must then be invariant by any replica permutation, an&#10;hypothesis referred so as replica-symmetric (RS).\&#10;In  it is discussed how this is not true in all cases, i.e. there exist&#10;a regime wherein the glass basin undergoes an ergodicity breaking and&#10;fractures into sub-basins. Nevertheless, here we stick to the simple RS&#10;ansatz. In this case, since the action must in turn be invariant for any&#10;replica permutations, the most general form that the Hessian can take is&#10;and the same goes for the covariance matrix . This form is completely&#10;general as it only pertains to the RS symmetry; then the only&#10;model-dependence is in the parameters , and , which must be computed&#10;case by case and are generally dependent on the external parameters like&#10;temperature or magnetic field. The diagonalization of the tensor is an&#10;exercise of standard linear algebra and has been already carried out&#10;many times, see for example  and  where it is proposed as an exercise.&#10;It is found that the tensor has only three distinct eigenvalues and the&#10;same goes for the tensor . Those three eigenvalues (or modes) are called&#10;the REPLICON, LONGITUDINAL, and ANOMALOUS, respectively . We are&#10;interested in the longitudinal mode (which in the limit is degenerate&#10;with the anomalous one), which becomes soft at the yielding transition .&#10;Let us consider the tensor. Because of replica symmetry, there are only&#10;three distinct correlators that one can define, namely and in the limit&#10;we know that It is then immediate to check that which then implies with&#10;the definitions as in the main text. We have used which derives from&#10;replica symmetry, as in the replica-symmetric phase.&#10;&#10;Let us now detail how to transform these definitions into quantities&#10;that can be measured in simulation. We start by “localizing” the&#10;definition of the overlap in the following way In a thermal simulation&#10;the and configurations would depend on the time , and so would the , so&#10;one would need to perform the in-state thermal average by considering&#10;the equilibrium value of these quantities. In the present paper we focus&#10;un athermal solids under quasi-static shear, so we do not have dynamics&#10;and the and configurations will simply be two distinct minima of the&#10;inter-particle potential obtained through the protocol described in the&#10;main text, and the thermal average will be the average over this&#10;ensemble of configurations which make up a glassy patch.\&#10;We now apply the definition in the , to construct the correlators. For&#10;illustrative purposes we use the . We get, omitting the overline to&#10;lighten the notation, with as in the main text, and we used that .&#10;Because of translational invariance, the correlator is actually&#10;independent of . We can get rid of by performing an integration over&#10;this variable, which, using the -functions, gives as a result then,&#10;following , we omit the terms with (which are anyway relevant only for )&#10;and we normalize the correlator with the pair distribution function of&#10;the glass; we finally obtain as in the main text. The derivation for the&#10;is then an obvious generalization.">

<outline text="Additional numerical results" _note="In the paper we have exhibited in Fig. 1 the susceptibilities and . For&#10;completeness we show here also the susceptibility , see Fig. \[GL\]. As&#10;discussed in the paper, this susceptibility is very close to 2. On the&#10;other hand the correlation functions themselves differ and differ&#10;significantly since the function is not positive definite, becoming&#10;negative towards the edges of the available fields. This is seen clearly&#10;in Fig. \[correlations\] where we show the three correlation function at&#10;the value of .&#10;&#10; \&#10;&#10;An interesting observation concerns the constant used in the fit Eq. 10&#10;in the paper. This constant is also sensitive to the approach of the&#10;criticality, cf. the lower panel in Fig.3 in the paper. One could worry&#10;that integrating this constant over could contribute to the divergence&#10;of the susceptibilities. In fact the rise in near the spinodal point&#10;goes down with the system size and its contribution to the integral is&#10;reduced as well, as can be seen in Fig. \[Ceffect\] which presents the&#10;integral from which is subtracted. The conclusion is that indeed the&#10;contribution of goes down also when integrated over the system size,&#10;showing that the main contribution to the divergence of the&#10;susceptibility is from the divergence of the correlation length.&#10;&#10;Finally we need to discuss the fitting procedure for the correlation&#10;function . In Fig. \[full\] we show the full results for this&#10;correlation function for all the available values of and for two larger&#10;systems sizes at our disposal. One sees that the exponents decay that is&#10;used for the fit is only reliable up to the minima of the functions. The&#10;reason for the upward trend is the periodic boundary condition that&#10;reflects the correlations. To eliminate this spurious effect we&#10;presented in the paper the fit up to the minimum in the function. One&#10;should note however that the distance to the minimum increases with the&#10;system size, presumably diverging in the thermodynamic limit. Thus the&#10;fit up to the minimum allows a faithful estimate of the correlation&#10;length .&#10;&#10;[13]{} natexlab\#1[\#1]{}bibnamefont \#1[\#1]{}bibfnamefont&#10;\#1[\#1]{}citenamefont \#1[\#1]{}url \#1[`#1`]{}urlprefix\[2\][\#2]{}&#10;\[2\]\[\][[\#2](#2)]{}&#10;&#10;, ****, (), &lt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp1:1995201&gt;.&#10;&#10;, , , , ****, (),&#10;&lt;http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.015701&gt;.&#10;&#10;, , , , ****, (),&#10;&lt;http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.085501&gt;.&#10;&#10;, ****, (), &lt;http://stacks.iop.org/1742-5468/2016/i=5/a=053302&gt;.&#10;&#10;, , , ****, (), &lt;http://stacks.iop.org/1742-5468/2012/i=10/a=P10012&gt;.&#10;&#10;, (, ).&#10;&#10;, ().&#10;&#10;, ****, (), ISSN , &lt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01309287&gt;.&#10;&#10;, ****, ().&#10;&#10;, , , in (, ), pp. .&#10;&#10;, (), .&#10;&#10;, (), .&#10;&#10;, , , , , , ****, (), ,&#10;&lt;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/30/8397.abstract&gt;.">
