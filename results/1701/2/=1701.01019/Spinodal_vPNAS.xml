<outline text="The correlation functions[sec:def]" _note="The relevant order parameter for the problem at hand is the overlap&#10;function which measures the distance between two configurations “&quot; and&#10;“&quot; of the same system. Denoting the position of the th particle as in&#10;configuration “&quot; and in configuration “&quot; we define where is the&#10;Heaviside step function and is a constant length which is taken below to&#10;be 1/3 in Lennard-Jones units (see below for numerical details). Thus&#10;for two identical configurations and when the distance between the&#10;positions of all the particles in the two configurations exceed . Based&#10;on the introductory discussion, we now derive an expression for the&#10;correlator associated with the longitudinal mode, from whence one can&#10;extract the correlation length associated with the onset of criticality&#10;at the yielding point, and define an associated susceptibility which&#10;will shoot up as the yielding point is approached. The first step is to&#10;“localize&quot; the overlap function and define the -dependent quantity Next,&#10;as mentioned above, the expression for the longitudinal correlator in&#10;terms of four-replica correlation functions can be found by&#10;diagonalization of the correlation matrix , which is defined as the&#10;inverse of the mass matrix of the replicated field theory of the overlap&#10;order parameter  . The derivation is a matter of standard&#10;diagonalization algebra, so we shall not report it here and refer to the&#10;SI for the details. The expression, employed for example in  in the case&#10;of a model with spins on a lattice, reads for athermal systems with the&#10;definitions Here angular brackets denote a thermal average in the&#10;thermal case and an evaluation in an inherent state in the athermal&#10;case; an indicates an average over different samples of the glass. The&#10;quantity is the correlation function of the replicon mode  and is just&#10;the garden-variety four-point correlator.&#10;&#10;Using these definitions and taking Eq. into account, the quantities we&#10;compute in numerical simulation, before taking the ensemble average, are&#10;(see the SI and Ref. ): and with These four-replica objects can be&#10;computed for any quadruplet of distinct replicas. The ensemble averaged&#10;correlation functions are simply obtained as and , and cf. the SI for a&#10;proof. We stress that one must keep the full space dependence of the&#10;correlators in the definitions above, as the introduction of shear&#10;breaks the rotational symmetry of the glass samples and so the&#10;correlators are not just functions of a distance .">

<outline text="Numerics" _note="To measure the quantities defined above, we performed molecular dynamics&#10;simulations of a Kob-Andersen 65-35% Lennard Jones Binary Mixture in .&#10;We have three system sizes, , and . We chose with in LJ units, but&#10;verified that changes in leave the emerging picture invariant.&#10;&#10;Following the procedure reported in Ref. , as a first step we prepared a&#10;glass by equilibrating the system at , and then quenching it (the rate&#10;is ) down to into a glassy configuration. The sample is then heated up&#10;again to , and a starting configuration of particle positions is chosen&#10;at this temperature. Note that while at equilibration is sufficiently&#10;fast, at the computation time is much shorter than the relaxation time.&#10;The configuration is then assigned a set of velocities randomly drawn&#10;from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at , and these different samples&#10;are then quenched down to at a rate of . This procedure can be repeated&#10;any number of times (say 100 times), and it allows us to get a sampling&#10;of the configurations, or replicas, inside one single “glassy patch&quot;. We&#10;then perform this procedure again, using each time a different&#10;configuration from the parent melt at , and in doing so we get an&#10;ensemble of these glassy patches, each of them representing a distinct&#10;glass sample. For each of these patches, we measure the four-replica&#10;correlators defined above for any distinct quadruplet of replicas,&#10;averaging the result over any possible permutations of the quadruplet to&#10;gain statistics . The ensemble average is then performed by averaging&#10;the result over all the glass samples. To perform these measurement,&#10;below we use 100 patches for , each with 100 configurations, 100 patches&#10;for each with 50 configurations and 50 patches for each with 50&#10;configurations. A strain (denoted below as ) is then applied&#10;quasi-statically to all configurations in all patches. In this protocol&#10;after every step of increased strain the system undergoes energy&#10;gradient minimization to return to mechanical equilibrium. This creates&#10;an ensemble of STRAINED PATCHES for every value of the strain parameter&#10;, from whence we measure again the above defined correlators, which then&#10;become functions of the strain . This is simply a consequence of the&#10;response of the configurations, i.e. each position in the definitions&#10;above becomes . Thus for example becomes etc. We are interested in the&#10;behavior of the correlators as the yielding point is approached.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Results" _note="We consider first the susceptibilities and that can be obtained from the&#10;correlators, for example In figure \[sus\] upper panel we show the&#10;susceptibility as a function of for the three system sizes at our&#10;disposal. Superimposed are the stress vs. strain curves obtained by&#10;averaging the individual curves over all the available configurations&#10;and glass samples. One sees very clearly the singularity that develops&#10;near the yield point as a function of the system size. In the lower&#10;panel of the same figure we show the susceptibility as a function of the&#10;strain , again with the stress-strain curve superimposed for comparison.&#10;As we expected, the susceptibilities show a distinct peak at the&#10;spinodal point wherein yielding occurs. Since is much smaller in&#10;amplitude than there is no much new information in which is&#10;approximately 2.&#10;&#10;More detailed information is provided by the full dependence of the&#10;correlators on their arguments. To see most clearly the change in the&#10;correlators as the spinodal point is approached, it is best to consider&#10;for example the one-dimensional function , shown for in Fig. \[cut\].&#10;&#10;Similar results for the other systems sizes are available in the SI. We&#10;note that the correlator changes both in amplitude and in extent when we&#10;approach the critical point. To quantify these changes we fit a 3&#10;parameter function to in the form where all the fitting coefficients are&#10;functions of . In Fig. \[results\] we present the dependence of the&#10;amplitude , the constant and the correlation length .&#10;&#10;It is interesting to notice that the constant decreases with the system&#10;size, presumably becoming irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit. The&#10;amplitude is still increasing with the system size, and it is difficult&#10;to assert whether it converges or not. On the other hand we can safely&#10;conclude that the data present a strong evidence for the increase in the&#10;correlation length; it is very likely that it should diverge in the&#10;thermodynamic limit.&#10;&#10;A relevant question is whether one can define critical exponents that&#10;can be measured also in experimental situations, and whether such&#10;exponents can be computed from theory, even on the mean-field level.&#10;Clearly, the standard thermal mean-field approach cannot be employed,&#10;since averages here are computed over replicas at , and fluctuations due&#10;to quenched disorder are expected to dominate the thermal fluctuations&#10;that stem only from the mother super-cooled liquid from which the&#10;replicas at are created. Considerations of the effect of such&#10;fluctuations are beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed&#10;elsewhere.">

<outline text="Physical interpretation" _note="To conclude this paper we present a physical interpretation to these new&#10;insights, connecting them to what is known about the mechanical yield in&#10;athermal amorphous solids. The most important characteristic of the&#10;mechanical yield in athermal amorphous solids is the change from plastic&#10;responses that are localized, typically in the form of Eshelby&#10;quadrupoles, to subextensive plastic events that are system spanning .&#10;The energy drops associated with the localized Eshelby quadrupoles are&#10;system size independent, scaling like where is the total number of&#10;particles in the system. Mechanical yield is associated with the&#10;spontaneous appearance of concatenated lines of quadrupoles (in 2&#10;dimensions, or planes in 3 dimensions, ). The latter are associated with&#10;energy drops that are subextensive, scaling like in 2 dimensions.&#10;Importantly, the concatenated lines of quadrupoles change drastically&#10;the displacement field associated with the plastic events. Each&#10;quadrupole has an arm with a displacement field pointing outward and an&#10;arm with the displacement field pointing inward. When the quadrupole is&#10;isolated the displacement field decays algebraically to infinity. In&#10;contrast, when the quadrupoles are organized in the line there is a&#10;global connection between the outgoing direction of one quadrupole and&#10;the incoming direction of the next, making the displacement field&#10;strongly localized around the line of quadrupoles (or around a plane in&#10;3 dimensions), and all the shear is there. This is a microscopic shear&#10;band. An example of the displacement field associated with such as&#10;system spanning event is shown in Fig. \[shearband\], and see Ref.  for&#10;details. The main point of this paper is that the highly correlated&#10;phenomenon of such a shear band can only occur when there exists a&#10;correlation length that approaches the system size in magnitude. This is&#10;the correlation length that is identified in this paper, and cf. the&#10;upper panel of Fig. \[results\].&#10;&#10;To understand the relevance of the spinodal point for this scenario, we&#10;provide two figures that were obtained in Ref. .&#10;&#10;In the upper panel of Fig.  \[phasetran\] one sees the order parameter&#10;as a function of , superimposed on the stress vs. strain curve of the&#10;system under study. The point “yield&quot; was obtained with the help of the&#10;results shown in the lower panel, in which the probability of observing&#10;is plotted for values of around the mechanical yield point . The yield&#10;itself is identified when the probability distribution function has two&#10;peaks of the same height. The spinodal point is at a slightly higher&#10;value of , where the peak occurring around high values of is about to&#10;disappear, with a characteristic spinodal vanishing of the slope. This&#10;is occurring in the present system around . Of course in the&#10;thermodynamic limit the whole range of values where the exchange of&#10;stability is occurring is becoming very narrow.&#10;&#10;It is important to stress again that the ability to observe the&#10;divergence of the susceptibility and the correlation length due to the&#10;spinodal phenomenon stems from the fact that we deal with an athermal&#10;glassy system whose typical relaxation times are immense. In a liquid&#10;system the fluctuations would have caused the system to make the&#10;transition before the spinodal point is reached.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the yielding transition&#10;is a spinodal point with disorder, characterized by a criticality whose&#10;features can be picked up by suitable multi-point correlators whose&#10;expression can be obtained from replica theory. The treatment presented&#10;here pertains to an athermal setting, but an obvious direction for&#10;future research will be the application of these ideas to thermal&#10;glasses under shear ; in that case, the system will generally be able to&#10;escape through thermal activation from the high- minimum before this has&#10;a chance to flatten and the relative susceptibility to diverge. However,&#10;since the nucleation time will anyway be fairly long, one should anyway&#10;be able to observe TRANSIENT shear-bands/heterogeneities, as long as the&#10;temperature is low enough that nucleation does not take place until the&#10;system is close to the spinodal, which, interestingly, is precisely the&#10;behavior of transient shear bands as reported in . In this thermal&#10;setting, we expect that the study of the ideas presented in this paper&#10;will have to proceed much as it does in the case of dynamical&#10;heterogeneities around the MCT crossover, entailing for example the&#10;definition and study of time-dependent multi-point susceptibilities and&#10;correlators.">
