    <title>Viscous displacement in porous media:\
the Muskat problem in 2D</title>
    <abstract>We consider the Muskat problem describing the viscous displacement in a
two-phase fluid system located in an unbounded two-dimensional porous
medium or Hele-Shaw cell. formulating the mathematical model as an
evolution problem for the sharp interface between the fluids, we show
that Muskat problem with surface tension is a quasilinear parabolic
problem, whereas, in the absence of surface tension effects, the
Rayleigh-Taylor condition identifies a domain of parabolicity for the
fully nonlinear problem. Based upon these aspects, we then establish the
local well-posedness for arbitrary large initial data in , , if surface
tension is taken into account, respectively for arbitrary large initial
data in that additionally satisfy the Rayleigh-Taylor condition if
surface tension effects are neglected. We also show that the problem
exhibits the parabolic smoothing effect and we provide criteria for the
global existence of solutions. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction and main results" _note="The Muskat problem is a model proposed by M. Muskat in to describe the&#10;encroachment of water into an oil sand. This problem is related to the&#10;secondary phase of the oil extraction process where water injection is&#10;sometimes used to increase the pressure in the oil reservoir and to&#10;drive the oil towards the extraction well. In this paper we consider an&#10;unbounded fluid system, consisting of two immiscible and incompressible&#10;fluid phases, which moves with constant speed , either in a horizontal&#10;or a vertical Hele-Shaw cell (or a homogeneous porous medium).&#10;Furthermore, we assume that the flows are two-dimensional and that the&#10;velocities are asymptotically equal to far away from the origin. In a&#10;reference frame which moves with the same speed as the fluids and in the&#10;same direction, the Muskat problem can be formulated as an evolution&#10;problem for the pair , where is a parametrization for the sharp&#10;interface that separates the fluids, with asymptotically flat for large&#10;, and is the jump of the velocity at the free interface in tangential&#10;direction (see ). Mathematically, we are confronted with the following&#10;evolution problem&#10;&#10;\[P\] where and are additionally coupled through the following relation&#10;for and .&#10;&#10;We denote by the spatial derivative is the Earth’s gravity, is the&#10;permeability of the homogeneous porous medium, is the surface tension&#10;coefficient at the free boundary, is the density and the viscosity of&#10;the fluid located at , where Moreover, is the curvature of the graph and&#10;denotes the principal value which, depending on the regularity of the&#10;functions under the integral, is taken at zero and/or infinity. If is&#10;positive, then the fluid expends into the region occupied by the fluid&#10;and vice versa, if is negative, then the fluid expends into the region&#10;occupied by the fluid (see Section \[Sec1\] for rigorous a derivation of&#10;). When neglecting surface tension effects we set and we require that&#10;the first equation of and the equation hold also at .&#10;&#10;In the recent years the Muskat problem has received, due to its physical&#10;relevance, much attention especially in the field of applied&#10;mathematics. In the absence of surface tension effects the local&#10;existence of solutions has been first addressed by F. Yi in under the&#10;assumption that the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds. The Rayleigh-Taylor&#10;condition is a sign restriction on the jump of the pressure gradients in&#10;normal direction at the interface , and it reads where is the pressure&#10;of the fluid and the outward normal at with respect to . Thereafter,&#10;questions related to the well-posedness of the Muskat problem and other&#10;qualitative aspects of the dynamics have been studied in in several&#10;physical scenarios and with various methods. These references show the&#10;Rayleigh-Taylor condition is crucial in the analysis of this problem. In&#10;the regime where the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds with reverse&#10;inequality sign, for example if a less viscous fluid displaces a more&#10;viscous one, or when a more dense fluid sits on top of a less dense one,&#10;physical experiments evidence the occurrence of viscous fingering, cf. ,&#10;and the Muskat problem is ill-posed, cf. e.g. . On the other hand, it&#10;was recently shown in , in a bounded and periodic striplike geometry,&#10;that the Rayleigh-Taylor condition actually identifies a domain of&#10;parabolicity for the Muskat problem.&#10;&#10;When surface tension effects are taken into consideration, it was proven&#10;in , in bounded geometries, that the Muskat problem is a quasilinear&#10;parabolic problem for arbitrary large initial data, without any kind of&#10;restrictions. Also in this setting, the solvability of the problem has&#10;been addressed in several physical scenarios with quite intricate&#10;methods .&#10;&#10;The first goal of this paper is to prove that the classical formulation&#10;of the Muskat problem, see Section \[Sec1\], is equivalent to the&#10;evolution problem , cf. Proposition \[PE\].&#10;&#10;Our second goal is to extend the methods that have been recently applied&#10;in , in the particular case of fluids with equal viscosities, to the&#10;general case considered herein in order to establish the local&#10;well-posedness for the Muskat problem with and without surface tension&#10;by similar strategies and in a very general context. If the fluids have&#10;equal viscosities, the equation determines as a function of , and&#10;becomes an evolution problem for only. Surprisingly, the analysis in&#10;shows that the corresponding evolution problem is of quasilinear&#10;parabolic type in both regimes, that is for , or when and the&#10;Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds. However, for , the equation is implicit&#10;and this fact enhances the nonlinear and nonlocal character of the&#10;problem and makes the analysis more involved. In the case when and the&#10;Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds, the well-posedness of the problem is&#10;still an open question. Local existence of solutions to has been first&#10;addressed in for arbitrary large data in , and in three space dimensions&#10;in for initial data in . Global existence is established in in the&#10;periodic case and for small initial data. Quite recently, the authors of&#10;have proven the existence and uniqueness of solutions which satisfy an&#10;additional energy estimate for initial data in which are small with&#10;respect to some -norm. In Theorem \[MT2\] we show that the Muskat&#10;problem without surface tension is well-posed for arbitrary large&#10;initial data in . To achieve this result we formulate as a fully&#10;nonlinear evolution problem for and we prove that the set of initial&#10;data for which the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds defines, also in this&#10;geometry, a domain of parabolicity for the Muskat problem. It is worth&#10;emphasizing that the quasilinear character, present for , is not&#10;preserved when and this makes the Muskat problem without surface tension&#10;more difficult to handle.&#10;&#10;For , the local well-posedness of has been addressed in for initial data&#10;in , with (see also for a global existence result for small initial data&#10;in , with ). Exploiting the quasilinear structure of the curvature term,&#10;we show that in this regime can be formulated as a quasilinear parabolic&#10;evolution problem. This property enables us to establish the local&#10;well-posedness of for arbitrary large initial in , with , cf.&#10;Theorem \[MT1\]. In particular, we may chose the initial data such that&#10;the curvature is unbounded or discontinuous.&#10;&#10;Moreover, we show that the Muskat problem features the effect of&#10;parabolic smoothing: solutions (which possess additional regularity when&#10;) become instantly real-analytic in the time-space domain. Besides, we&#10;provide criteria for the global existence of solutions.&#10;&#10;The first main result of this paper is the following theorem.&#10;&#10;\[MT1\] Let . The problem possesses for each , a unique maximal solution&#10;with , and defines a semiflow on . Additionally, if then . Moreover,&#10;given , it holds that In particular, is real-analytic for each&#10;&#10;We emphasize that exactly the same result as in Theorem \[MT1\] has been&#10;achieved in in the simpler case of fluids with equal viscosities.&#10;&#10;When surface tension is neglected, that is , we assume that The&#10;situation when is special, because in this case the problem possesses&#10;for each , with , a unique global solution for all , cf. Section&#10;\[Sec4\]. The corresponding flow is stationary with constant velocities&#10;equal to and hydrostatic pressures.&#10;&#10;In order to discuss the well-posedness of with , we introduce the set of&#10;initial data for which the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds as The&#10;Rayleigh-Taylor condition is reformulated later on, cf. , where it is&#10;also proven that is an open subset of . Our analysis in Section \[Sec4\]&#10;shows that is nonempty if and only if The relation is the classical&#10;condition found within the linear theory by Saffman and Taylor . In&#10;particular, if the flow takes place in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell and ,&#10;then the less dense fluid lies above. For flows in horizontal Hele-Shaw&#10;cells the effects due to gravity are usually neglected, that is , and&#10;implies that and that the more viscous fluid expends into the region&#10;occupied by the less viscous one.&#10;&#10;We now come to the second main result of this paper.&#10;&#10;\[MT2\] Let , [^1], and assume that holds. Given , the problem possesses&#10;a solution for some and an arbitrary . It further holds:&#10;&#10; is the unique solution to belonging to&#10;&#10; may be extended to a maximally defined solution for all , where&#10;&#10;The solution map defines a semiflow on which is real-analytic in the&#10;open set ;&#10;&#10;If is uniformly continuous for all , then either&#10;&#10;If for some and , then&#10;&#10;Given and a Banach space , we let \[resp. \] denote the Banach space of&#10;all bounded functions form \[resp. \] into , and, given we set&#10;&#10;With respect to we add the following comments. Firstly, as shown in in&#10;the case when , there exist solutions which are not uniformly continuous&#10;in , in the sense that their slope blows up in finite time. Secondly,&#10;there exist global solutions to , cf. (see also ) or (in the periodic&#10;setting). Lastly, the existence of solutions which are uniformly bounded&#10;in and violate the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition at time is, to the&#10;best of our knowledge, an open issue.&#10;&#10;The condition that for some imposed at is a technical assumption.&#10;Nevertheless, if our arguments can be extended to show that&#10;Theorem \[MT2\] still holds true if we replace by and by for possibly&#10;with a smaller maximal existence time . Hence, for solutions that start&#10;in , the property required at is satisfied for all and all This&#10;additional regularity is needed for our argument because the uniqueness&#10;property in Theorem \[MT2\] holds only for solutions that additionally&#10;belong to the space , for some , and this space is not sufficiently&#10;flexible with respect to the parameter trick used in the proof of&#10;Theorem \[MT2\].&#10;&#10;[^1]: Theorem \[MT2\] is still valid when however in this case its&#10;    assertions can be improved, cf. .">

<outline text="The governing equations and the equivalence result" _note="We start by presenting the classical formulation of the Muskat problem&#10;introduced in Section \[Sec0\]. First of all, both fluids are taken to&#10;be incompressible, immiscible, and of Newtonian type. Since flows in&#10;porous media or Hele-Shaw cells occur at low Reynolds numbers, they are&#10;usually modeled as being two-dimensional and Darcy’s law is used instead&#10;of the conservation of momentum equation . Hence, the equations of&#10;motion in the fluid layers are[^1]&#10;&#10;\[PB\] with denoting the velocity of the fluid These equations are&#10;supplemented by the natural boundary conditions on the free surface&#10;where is the unit normal at pointing into and the Euclidean inner&#10;product on . Furthermore, we impose the following far-field boundary&#10;conditions The motion of the interface is coupled to that of the fluids&#10;through the kinematic boundary condition and the interface at time is&#10;assumed to be known&#10;&#10;We now rewrite the classical formulation of the Muskat problem in a&#10;coordinates system which moves with the same speed and in the same&#10;direction as the fluid system. To this end we introduce It is not&#10;difficult to see that the equations are equivalent to the following&#10;system of equations which has as unknowns&#10;&#10;Before stating the equivalence result, cf. Proposition \[PE\], we first&#10;give a preparatory lemma, which is needed in the proof of&#10;Proposition \[PE\] and also later on in the analysis (see the proof of&#10;Theorem \[T:I1\]). The proof of Lemma \[L:A2\] is based on classical&#10;arguments used to establish the Plemelj formula and the Privalov theorem&#10;for Cauchy-type integrals defined on regular curves, see e.g. , and on&#10;the Lemmas \[L:99a\]-\[L:99d\]. Details of the proof can be found, in a&#10;particular case, in .&#10;&#10;\[L:A2\]Given and , we define Let further , , and . Then, and&#10;Additionally, if then there exists a positive integer and a constant&#10;such that&#10;&#10;The first two claims can be established in the same way as in , while is&#10;a simple exercise.&#10;&#10;In the particular case when gives a precise correlation between the&#10;smoothness of and that of . This correlation is for no longer obvious.&#10;We prove herein, cf. Proposition \[P:I2\], that for , the equation has a&#10;unique solution , provided that the left-hand side of belongs to . If ,&#10;the latter requirement implies that in fact is needed. Thanks to the&#10;parabolic smoothing in Theorem \[MT2\], this additional regularity is&#10;inherited by all solutions. This is one of the reasons, besides the&#10;difference in nonlinear behavior, why we separate in Proposition \[PE\]&#10;the cases and .&#10;&#10;\[PE\] Let be given.&#10;&#10;Let .

Hence, our task&#10;reduces to establishing the generator property for the leading order&#10;term The proof of this property is technical and is based on an approach&#10;followed previously in in the context of spaces of continuous functions,&#10;and refined recently in .&#10;&#10;In order to proceed we choose for each a so-called finite -localization&#10;family, that is a family with sufficiently large, such that Such&#10;-localization families can be easily constructed. Furthermore, we choose&#10;a second family with the following properties&#10;&#10;The following remark is a simple exercise.&#10;&#10;\[R:3\] Given and a finite -localization family , the mapping defines a&#10;norm on which is equivalent to the standard -norm.&#10;&#10;Let us now introduce the continuous path which connects the operator&#10;with . Recalling Proposition \[P1d\], we have the following identity&#10;where denotes the Fourier multiplier with symbol The following result&#10;shows that the operator can be approximated, in a sense to be made&#10;precise below, by Fourier multipliers where denotes negative constants.&#10;&#10;\[TK1\] Let and be given. Then, there exist , a finite -localization&#10;family , a constant , and for each and there exist bounded operators&#10;such that for all , and . The operators are defined by where ,&#10;respectively&#10;&#10;We first pick a finite -localization family and an associated family ,&#10;with to be fixed later on in the proof. It is convenient to write where,&#10;for , denotes the Lipschitz function We further let respectively In the&#10;following we denote by constants which are independent of (and, of&#10;course, of , , , and ) and the constants denoted by may depend only upon&#10;To establish we first consider the case .&#10;&#10;[THE CASE .]{} Given and , we write where To begin, we compute, by using&#10;the fact that on , that where, using integration by parts, we may&#10;reexpress in the following way Combining Lemma \[L:99a\]  and&#10;Proposition \[P1d\] , we see that and therewith We next estimate the&#10;term . In view of and using integration by parts, we have where, given ,&#10;and , we set the last identity following by using integration by parts.&#10;In view of , it follows from , and (with ) that The estimate is clearly&#10;valid also for . Choosing sufficiently small, it follows from and that&#10;provided that is sufficiently small.&#10;&#10;We now consider the term which is decomposed as follows with We first&#10;estimate . Integrating by parts, we get Furthermore, letting denote the&#10;Lipschitz function satisfying on and on we have and combined with leads&#10;us to provided that is sufficiently small. Since can be estimated in a&#10;similar way, we conclude that if is chosen sufficiently small.&#10;&#10;We now turn to and note that and therefore Recalling , we have and&#10;combined with and (with ) yields provided that is sufficiently small. We&#10;are left with the term where The term may be estimated in a similar way&#10;as the term above, while integrating by parts, we obtain, similarly as&#10;in the study of , the following estimate For sufficiently small , leads&#10;us to and, together with , we conclude The desired estimate follows for&#10;from , , , , and .&#10;&#10;[THE CASE .]{} Similarly as in the previous case, we write with The&#10;estimates derived when studying together with the fact that vanishes at&#10;infinity imply that for sufficiently small .&#10;&#10;If , then and we are left to consider the case , when . The relation&#10;implies that where Integrating by parts we get To deal with , we let&#10;denote the function defined by Since , the relation implies that for .&#10;Moreover, recalling , we find for sufficiently small that and therewith&#10;&#10;Finally, it holds that and, since vanishes at infinity, the arguments&#10;used to derive show that provided that is sufficiently small.&#10;Furthermore, the first term on the right-hand side of is decomposed as&#10;follows where is the function introduced when considering . Integrating&#10;by parts the integral terms, we infer from Lemma \[L:99a\] , , , and the&#10;fact that vanishes at infinity that for sufficiently small. The latter&#10;estimate together with and implies that if is sufficiently small.&#10;Summarizing, for the desired estimate follows from , , , . This&#10;completes the proof.&#10;&#10;The Fourier multipliers found in Theorem \[TK1\] are elements of the&#10;family of unbounded operators , where Each operator is the generator of&#10;a strongly continuous analytic semigroup in Moreover, it is not&#10;difficult to prove (see for example the proof of ) that there exists a&#10;constant such that for all , with , and . Combining these properties&#10;with Theorem \[TK1\], we obtain the following generation result.&#10;&#10;\[TK2\] Given , it holds that&#10;&#10;The proof is similar to that of , so that we only present the main&#10;steps. Using the inequality , Remark \[R:3\], and Theorem \[TK1\], we&#10;may find constants and such that for all , with , and . Additionally,&#10;since , the relation shows that and together with the method of&#10;continuity yields Since is a lower order perturbation, the claim follows&#10;from and .&#10;&#10;We now come to the proof of our first main result, which is mainly based&#10;on the abstract theory for quasilinear parabolic problems due to H.&#10;Amann, cf. , and a recent idea from the proof of where a parameter&#10;trick, also used in , is employed in a different manner.&#10;&#10;In virtue of and of Theorem \[TK2\], we have This relation together with&#10;the well-known interpolation property the choices , , , and the&#10;relations enables us to use abstract results , see , to establish, for&#10;each , , the existence of a unique classical solution to such that and&#10;&#10;Concerning the uniqueness claim, it suffices to show that any classical&#10;solution to satisfies with see . Let thus be fixed. The boundedness of ,&#10;Theorem \[T:I1\], Proposition \[P:I2\], and an interpolation argument&#10;imply that for all (in particular for ), and recalling that we are led&#10;to Arguing as in the proof of , we obtain in view of that&#10;&#10;In order to study the boundedness of we first note that and Lemma&#10;\[L:99a\] implies To deal with the remaining term, we may argue as in&#10;the proof of to obtain, in virtue of , that Given , it holds that and by&#10;Proposition \[P1d\] we deduce that with for all , where is the adjoint&#10;of , cf. Lemma \[L:99f\]. Moreover, since the estimate leads us to for&#10;all , hence Letting denote the adjoint of , it is not difficult to see&#10;that and the Lemmas \[L:99a\]-\[L:99d\] yield with Since for and we&#10;deduce from - that Gathering , , and it follows that , and together with&#10;we conclude that This proves the uniqueness claim.&#10;&#10;The criterion for global existence and the remaining regularity&#10;properties follow in the same way as in particular case (see the proofs&#10;of ), and the details are therefore omitted.">
