<outline text="Introduction" _note="A major obstacle to simulate lattice QCD at nonzero chemical potential&#10;is formed by the complex valued determinant of the Dirac operator. This&#10;SIGN PROBLEM prohibits the use of importance sampling algorithms to&#10;generate relevant configurations and most solutions to circumvent this&#10;problem have a computational cost that grows exponentially in the volume&#10;and are restricted to the region of the phase diagram where , away from&#10;the critical region.&#10;&#10;An alternative which became increasingly popular in recent years is the&#10;complex Langevin (CL) method. Although the equations employed in this&#10;method are straightforward generalizations of the real Langevin&#10;equations from real to complex actions, the validity of the complexified&#10;equations require a number of conditions to be met. It is important to&#10;investigate theories and models with complex actions to deepen our&#10;understanding when the complex Langevin method can be used and trusted.&#10;Recent investigations in heavy-dense QCD and full QCD showed that the&#10;method breaks down in the transition region. Problems with the CL method&#10;were also uncovered in low-dimensional strong-coupling QCD , as the&#10;method converges to wrong values for small masses at large coupling.&#10;&#10;In this presentation we introduce a novel idea where we combine the CL&#10;method and reweighting of complex trajectories to form the reweighted&#10;complex Langevin (RCL) method . As we will show in the results on&#10;two-dimensional QCD this method allows us to reach regions of parameter&#10;space that are not simulated correctly by the CL method alone.">

<outline text="Complex Langevin Method" _note="We first briefly introduce the complex Langevin method. Assume a&#10;partition function with real degrees of freedom and complex action ,&#10;where can be assumed to a multidimensional vector of variables. When&#10;applying the Langevin equations on a system with a complex action the&#10;real variables are automatically driven into the complex plane, such&#10;that . These complex variables satisfy the CL evolution equation This&#10;equation can be solved numerically after proper discretization and the&#10;standard stochastic Euler discretization yields the discrete Langevin&#10;time evolution with drift , step size and independent Gaussian noise&#10;(chosen real for better convergence) with mean 0 and variance 2.&#10;&#10;It is important to understand if and when the fixed point solution of&#10;the complex Langevin equation reproduces the correct expectation values&#10;of the partition function . It was shown that if the action and the&#10;observable are holomorphic in the complexified variables (up to&#10;singularities) the crucial equivalence identity holds if the probability&#10;density of the complexified variables along the CL trajectories is&#10;suppressed close to singularities of drift and observable and decays&#10;sufficiently rapidly in the imaginary direction of . If the CL validity&#10;conditions are not satisfied for some parameter values the CL method&#10;will fail and produce incorrect results. For QCD this depends on the&#10;values of the parameters , , , see Sec. \[QCD\].">

<outline text="Reweighting the complex Langevin trajectories" _note="Below we introduce the reweighted complex Langevin (RCL) method . The&#10;principle of the method is to generate a CL trajectory for an auxiliary&#10;ensemble where the CL method is valid and to reweight this complex&#10;trajectory to compute observables in a target ensemble. The aim is to&#10;extend the applicability range of the CL method to parameter regions for&#10;which the CL validity conditions may not be satisfied.&#10;&#10;Consider a target ensemble with parameters and an auxiliary ensemble&#10;with parameters . The general reweighting formula to compute expectation&#10;values in the target ensemble using configurations from the auxiliary&#10;ensemble is given by The peculiarity of our reweighting method is that&#10;we consider an auxiliary ensemble at nonzero chemical potential such&#10;that the auxiliary weights are complex, whereas these are taken real and&#10;positive in standard reweighting procedures. Therefore we cannot use&#10;importance sampling to generate relevant configurations in the auxiliary&#10;ensemble, but will instead use the CL method to generate an auxiliary&#10;trajectory of complex valued configurations.&#10;&#10;If the CL method is valid for the parameters , the CL equivalence holds&#10;for the auxiliary ensemble and can be applied to both in the reweighting&#10;formula , which yields the following RCL equation: The expectation value&#10;in the target ensemble is thus computed as a ratio of averages, both&#10;evaluated along the auxiliary CL trajectory. As the CL method is valid&#10;in the auxiliary ensemble, both expectation values in this ratio will be&#10;evaluated reliably, independently of the fact if the CL method itself is&#10;valid or not in the target ensemble. Indeed, as we will see in the next&#10;section, the RCL method also works well if the CL validity conditions&#10;are violated in the target ensemble.&#10;&#10;As this reweighting along complex trajectories is a novel idea, it is&#10;important to put the method at a test and verify that it works as&#10;expected. In the next section we show results in two-dimensional QCD,&#10;but the method has also been successfully tested on random matrix models&#10;for QCD.">

  <outline text="Complex Langevin for QCD" _note="Let us consider the partition function of lattice QCD, with SU(3)&#10;matrices , Wilson gauge action and staggered Dirac operator for a quark&#10;of mass at chemical potential . For nonzero the Dirac determinant is&#10;complex, so we have a complex action and a potential sign problem. In&#10;this case, the CL equations will drive the links from SU(3) into . When&#10;the complex trajectories wander off too far from SU(3) the CL method&#10;becomes invalid. This problem is resolved in gauge theories by applying&#10;GAUGE COOLING , which keeps the trajectories as close as possible to&#10;SU(3) using gauge invariance.&#10;&#10;Although gauge cooling can alter the CL trajectory such that the CL&#10;validity conditions are satisfied, there is no guarantee that this can&#10;be achieved for all parameter values. This was investigated in detail&#10;for strong-coupling QCD in 1+1 dimensions where we showed that, even&#10;with gauge cooling, the CL results are only valid in a certain () range.&#10;At small masses the CL trajectories still populate the singularity at&#10;and CL irrecoverably gives wrong results. These are cases of interest to&#10;verify if the RCL method can be used to recover the correct results.">

  <outline text="Reweighting in the mass" _note="We first test the CL method by computing the chiral condensate and the&#10;number density on a lattice in the strong-coupling limit and choose as&#10;the sign problem is most pronounced around this value. Even though the&#10;sign problem is still mild on such a small lattice, the results of gauge&#10;cooled CL are wrong for small masses (), as is illustrated by the blue&#10;points in the top row of Fig. \[RCL-m\], due to the singular drift&#10;problem. The benchmark results (grey band) were computed with&#10;phase-quenched reweighting simulations. We apply the RCL equation using&#10;an auxiliary CL trajectory generated at mass for the same and compute&#10;the RCL results for the range . The results are given by the red points&#10;in the figure. Clearly RCL in mass works over the complete mass range on&#10;this lattice size, even in the strong coupling limit.&#10;&#10;Next we tested the RCL method on a lattice at , again for where the sign&#10;problem is strongest. The results are shown in the bottom row of&#10;Fig. \[RCL-m\]. Again, gauge cooled CL (blue points) is wrong for small&#10;masses (). The RCL method uses an auxiliary trajectory generated at and&#10;to compute the results for . On this somewhat larger lattice the overlap&#10;and sign problems become visible through larger error bars, but&#10;nevertheless, the RCL method does work down to very small masses.">

  <outline text="Reweighting in the chemical potential" _note="Clearly we can use the RCL method to reweight in any relevant parameter&#10;and we here investigate the reweighting in the chemical potential . In&#10;Fig. \[RCL-mu\] we show the strong-coupling () results for small mass on&#10;(top) and (bottom) lattices as a function of . We see that for such&#10;small masses the gauge cooled CL method fails to reproduce the correct&#10;results. The RCL results are computed using an auxiliary CL trajectory&#10;generated at for the lattice and at for the lattice. In all cases the&#10;RCL results agree with the benchmark over the complete range within the&#10;error bars. The increasing errors for the lattice in the critical region&#10;point to an increasing sign problem. It is however surprising that RCL&#10;works well for small , i.e., far from the auxiliary value, meaning that&#10;there is no serious overlap problem in this case. When performing this&#10;reweighting in for even smaller masses the reweighting method will start&#10;to break down as the sign problem becomes stronger.">

  <outline text="Reweighting in the coupling" _note="Even though RCL in and could just as well have been performed at nonzero&#10;, away from the strong coupling limit, we chose to work at as this&#10;pushes the CL method to its limits.&#10;&#10;As a last test we use RCL to perform reweighting in . It is known that&#10;the CL method is valid for large but breaks down for lower values.&#10;Simulations at such values are however needed to reach the critical&#10;region in current lattice simulations. It would therefore be helpful if&#10;RCL could be applied to valid CL trajectories generated at large to&#10;reach lower values.&#10;&#10;Fig. \[RCL-beta\] shows the results for and on a lattice. The CL method&#10;only works correctly for large , so we investigate if RCL allows us to&#10;reach lower values. Unfortunately, the range of application of RCL in&#10;seems quite restricted: starting from an auxiliary trajectory at RCL&#10;works down to and from it works down to . In both cases RCL does not&#10;perform better than the original CL. This is due to the extremely sharp&#10;probability density of the gauge action, where is a multiplicative&#10;factor in the exponential. Even tiny changes in strongly affect the&#10;gauge weight and reweighting is inefficient.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Some additional remarks" _note="Although RCL works correctly to reweight from one set of parameters to&#10;another, it suffers from the usual overlap and sign problems. A possible&#10;advantage over other reweighting procedures (phase-quenched, Glasgow and&#10;quenched reweightings) is that the auxiliary ensemble at could be closer&#10;to the target ensemble, thus increasing the overlap between the target&#10;and auxiliary ensembles. In Glasgow reweighting the auxiliary ensemble&#10;is taken at . Clearly, reweighting from using RCL starts from an&#10;auxiliary ensemble that is closer to the target ensemble.&#10;&#10;In phase-quenched reweighting the auxiliary ensemble uses the magnitude&#10;of the fermion determinant as sampling weights. The auxiliary and target&#10;ensembles are in different phases when and there is therefore little&#10;overlap between the relevant configurations in both ensembles. In RCL,&#10;however, the auxiliary and target ensembles are both taken in full QCD&#10;and hence this problem could be alleviated. Moreover, RCL uses a single&#10;CL trajectory to reweight to a range of target parameter values, whereas&#10;phase-quenched reweighting typically constructs a new Markov chain for&#10;each new parameter value.">

<outline text="Summary and outlook" _note="For many theories with a complex action the complex Langevin method&#10;works correctly for some range of parameters, but fails for other&#10;parameter values when the validity conditions are violated. In this talk&#10;we have presented the REWEIGHTED COMPLEX LANGEVIN method, which combines&#10;complex Langevin and reweighting to compute observables in a target&#10;ensemble using complex trajectories generated for an auxiliary ensemble&#10;for which the CL validity conditions are met.&#10;&#10;As a proof of principle we applied RCL on QCD in 1+1 dimension using&#10;reweighting in , and at and verified that the RCL procedure works&#10;correctly. We observed that RCL works best when reweighting in the mass,&#10;while reweighting in works well as long as the mass is not too small.&#10;Reweighting in hardly works as the gauge probability is narrow and very&#10;sensitive to . Clearly, the method could be further optimized by making&#10;a multiparameter RCL in , , . As the method suffers from the usual&#10;overlap and sign problems, its efficacy should be investigated further.&#10;&#10;As an outlook for future work we can pinpoint a couple of avenues. One&#10;interesting application would be to test RCL on full four-dimensional&#10;QCD where it was shown that CL breaks down in the critical region. As&#10;mass reweighting works best the strategy could be to choose a high&#10;enough to get a valid CL trajectory for a particular and then reweight&#10;in to get down to the physical mass region. Alternatively one could&#10;follow a line in the -plane keeping fixed.&#10;&#10;Clearly, one still has to learn how to reweight most efficiently with&#10;the RCL method. A useful exercise would be to make a validity map of the&#10;CL method in the -space for two-dimensional QCD and devise the best&#10;reweighting path to cover all parameter values.&#10;&#10;Note that RCL opens a new avenue as reweighting in the chemical&#10;potential can be extended to interpolate rather then just extrapolate if&#10;we use auxiliary ensembles at values above and below the critical&#10;region, which could improve the quality of the results.">
