<outline text="Predictions from the integrated quantities" _note="The major motivation for linking the growth of galaxies to the growth of&#10;their central BH has arisen empirically from the strong correlations&#10;seen in their integrated properties (the primary example being the tight&#10;– relation). We therefore require an evolutionary model that suitably&#10;fits this end point. In the simplest case, where BHs and their host&#10;galaxy grow in concert (or co-evolve), the relational form between their&#10;growth rates can be easily predicted. Given a functional form of the –&#10;relation described via&#10;&#10;where is the gradient of the slope and is the intercept, the predicted&#10;relation between the growth rates is simply found by differentiating&#10;with respect to time, i.e,&#10;&#10;In the trivial case where (i.e, a linear relation) this reduces to&#10;&#10;Within this scenario, growth rates are directly proportional to one&#10;another scaled by the intercept, , of the – relation. Therefore, if the&#10;functional form between the growth rates is described via&#10;&#10;where again and are the slope and intercept values, we would expect and&#10;in the case where .&#10;&#10;Throughout this study we will test the hypothesis that there exists a&#10;broadly linear co-evolution between galaxies and their central BHs, a&#10;plausible scenario fitting the empirical – relation. We refer throughout&#10;to as the gradient of the slope between the integrated properties (–)&#10;and to as the slope between each growth rate (–), both in log space.">
