<outline text="Conclusions" _note="We have investigated the relationship between the galaxy star formation&#10;rate (SFR) and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) of the central black&#10;hole (BH) using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Our main&#10;conclusions are as follows:&#10;&#10;We compared predictions to two recent observational studies in&#10;\[fig:stanley2015,fig:delvecchio2015\]. The simulation reproduces both&#10;the flat trend of the mean SFR () as a function of BHAR found in the AGN&#10;selected study of and the approximately linear trend of the mean BHAR ()&#10;as a function of SFR found in the SFR selected study of .&#10;&#10;There is a moderate difference in the –BHAR relationship when&#10;time-averaging each growth rate over a 100 Myr period for an AGN&#10;selected study (\[fig:avandinst\]). However, this change was not found&#10;to be sufficient as to revert the trend to an underlying linear&#10;relationship as has been proposed by previous theoretical studies.&#10;&#10;Examining the complete SFR–BHAR plane in \[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_z1\], we&#10;found no evidence for a simple universal global relationship between the&#10;two instantaneous growth rates. The difference between the trends found&#10;for the –BHAR and –SFR relations from AGN and SFR selections&#10;respectively, is due to sampling different regions of this complex&#10;plane. The complexity of this plane results from both the rate of&#10;galactic star formation and the accretion rate of the central BH holding&#10;an evolving connection to the host dark matter halo&#10;(\[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_byhalo\]).&#10;&#10;For a discrete redshift, the characteristic SFR of a halo increases&#10;smoothly with increasing halo mass (\[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_byhalo\]). BHs&#10;in haloes of mass accrete at a rate (). They then transition through&#10;haloes of mass to a rate () in haloes of mass . However, the scatter in&#10;the BHAR at fixed halo mass is very large (up to  dex). Galaxies with&#10;SFRs far below the characteristic SFR all contain massive BHs ( ).&#10;&#10;The median evolutionary trend for a galaxy’s SFR and the accretion rate&#10;of its central BH, averaged over 100 Myr, are insensitive to the final&#10;properties of the system (\[fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm\]). By equating these&#10;trends together we found that the 100 Myr average SFR as a function of&#10;the 100 Myr average BHAR can be split into three regimes, separated by&#10;the halo mass (\[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_av\]). BHs hosted by haloes below&#10;the characteristic transition mass, , fail to grow effectively, yet the&#10;galaxy continues to grow with the halo. Once the halo reaches there is a&#10;non-linear of BH growth that rapidly builds the mass of the BH. In the&#10;most massive haloes ( &amp;gt; ) both SFR and BHAR decline on average, with&#10;a roughly constant scaling of SFR/BHAR .">
