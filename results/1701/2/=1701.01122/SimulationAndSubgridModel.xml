<outline text="Simulations &amp;amp; Subgrid model" _note="is a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations comprising a range&#10;of periodic volumes, numerical resolutions and physical models. The&#10;simulations are run using a substantially modified version of the N-body&#10;TreePM smoothed particle hydrodynamics code -3 , referred to as . For&#10;this study we focus on the largest run (Ref-L0100N1504), a cubic&#10;periodic volume of 100 comoving megaparsecs (cMpc) on each side,&#10;containing dark matter particles of mass  and an equal number of&#10;baryonic particles with an initial mass of  . The subgrid parameters are&#10;those of the reference () model, described fully by . Cosmological&#10;parameters are those inferred by , namely: , , , and .">

A detailed&#10;description of the full subgrid prescription is given by , with&#10;consideration to their influence on the reference model given by .

In addition, 400 data-lite are&#10;produced, with a typical temporal separation of 40-60 Myr. Bound&#10;structures are identified in post processing. First, dark matter haloes&#10;are identified using the (FOF) algorithm with linking length of times&#10;the mean interparticle separation . Then, bound substructures (or )&#10;within these haloes are identified with the program applied to the full&#10;particle distribution (dark matter, gas, stars and BHs). We associate&#10;the baryonic component of each subhalo with a galaxy, defined to be the&#10;CENTRAL galaxy if it hosts the particle with the minimum gravitational&#10;potential and the remainder being classified as SATELLITES.&#10;&#10;Halo mass, , is defined as the total mass enclosed within , the radius&#10;at which the mean enclosed density is 200 times the critical density of&#10;the Universe.

    <outline text="Constructing histories of individual galaxies" _note="In order to accurately trace the evolution of individual galaxies and&#10;their central BH for the analysis in \[sect:to\_halo\], we require&#10;histories of a higher temporal resolution than is provided by the&#10;snipshot output. To do this, we follow galaxies and their central BH&#10;through cosmic time. As a galaxy descendant may have multiple&#10;progenitors, we trace the progenitor galaxy that is hosted along the of&#10;the merger tree as defined by , the branch containing the greatest total&#10;mass along its history.&#10;&#10;BHARs are recorded at each timestep with a typical spacing of  yr,&#10;yielding an rate. These can then be time-averaged over longer durations.&#10;Quoted SFRs are taken from the snapshot output, where they are computed&#10;based on the current star forming state of the gas contained within the&#10;galaxy. Time-averaged SFR histories are constructed from the stellar&#10;particles born within the main progenitor that reside in the galaxy at&#10;the present day. As these particles store both their birth time and&#10;initial mass, collectively they create a robust history of star&#10;formation for that galaxy. However, as these histories are sensitive in&#10;their resolution to the number of particles sampled, only galaxies&#10;containing more than 200 particles ( ) are considered for this study.&#10;&#10;\[fig:variability\] shows an example history of an individual galaxy’s&#10;SFR (top panel) and accretion rate of the central BH (bottom panel)&#10;through cosmic time taken from the methods described above. We show each&#10;growth rate time-averaged over 5 Myr (blue and green lines) and 100 Myr&#10;(red and black lines) to highlight the large difference in variability&#10;scatter between the two timescales. This is particularly severe for&#10;BHAR, where values recorded over short timescales do not return a good&#10;approximation of the long term average rate, differing in value by as&#10;much as 4 dex. We have adopted 100 Myr as our long averaging duration as&#10;it reflects an estimate of the effective timescale for empirical&#10;indicators of star formation using the far-infrared . Although there are&#10;similar features between SFR and BHAR through time for this individual&#10;case (for example a common peak at a lookback time of 12 Gyr), globally&#10;the two histories are quite different.">

  <outline text="The – relation" _note="\[fig:bhm\_vs\_hm\] shows the – relation for central galaxies at . We&#10;have plotted as a function of halo mass rather than bulge or total&#10;stellar mass due to the crucial connection that has with both SFR and&#10;BHAR (see \[sect:to\_halo\] onwards). We note that the – relation also&#10;follows the same behaviour and throughout this description and can be&#10;interchanged. The overlaid two dimensional bins are for the continued&#10;investigation in \[sect:to\_halo\], where they are fully described.&#10;&#10;The empirical relationship between BH mass and that of the classical&#10;bulge is well described by a single power law at high mass . Indeed, one&#10;of the calibration parameters of the simulation is to match the&#10;normalisation of this relationship. However, whereas traditionally this&#10;trend has been linearly extrapolated to lower-mass systems, predicts a&#10;steepening of the trend. As a consequence, the relation between BH mass&#10;and the mass of the host galaxy or halo is not well described by a&#10;single power law. Interestingly, a steeper slope at intermediate masses&#10;is supported by recent observations of bulge (or pseudobulge) systems .&#10;When total stellar mass is considered as the independent variable,&#10;predict Seyfert-like systems yield and alternate – relationship to&#10;previously measured early-type systems. However, each trend is&#10;consistent with a linear relation, with Seyfert-like systems harbouring&#10;a lower normalisation.&#10;&#10;For , BHs in massive systems ( ) follow an approximately linear trend&#10;with halo mass (compare to the black dashed black line in&#10;\[fig:bhm\_vs\_hm\]), but those hosted by haloes with mass follow a much&#10;steeper relation and those in the lowest mass systems ( ) plateau at the&#10;seed BH mass.&#10;&#10; argue that multiple physical processes drive the relation between and .&#10;In low (high) mass systems stellar (AGN) feedback regulates the baryonic&#10;inflow to the galaxy, suppressing BH (continued stellar) growth. There&#10;is a critical transition halo mass ( , hereafter ) separating these two&#10;regulatory regimes. Within haloes, neither feedback process is dominant,&#10;and as a result BHs grow at a highly non-linear rate. These phases&#10;create the flat, supra-linear and linear regimes of BH growth seen in&#10;the integrated quantities of \[fig:bhm\_vs\_hm\] and have important&#10;consequences for the galaxy and BH growth rates investigated throughout&#10;this study.">

  <outline text="Absolute calibration of SFRs" _note="When comparing to the observed cosmic SFR density, found an almost&#10;constant -0.2 dex offset for redshifts . There is however continued&#10;uncertainty as to the absolute calibration of SFR indicators on which&#10;these observations rely. For example, find upon revisiting this&#10;calibration with the addition of WISE photometry to the full SDSS&#10;spectroscopic galaxy sample that the SFRs of local galaxies along the&#10;main-sequence are systematically lower than previously estimated by&#10; dex, yielding good agreement with the prediction .&#10;&#10;As the observational datasets compared to in \[sect:observations\]&#10;utilise an earlier calibration, we REDUCE all observed SFRs by 0.2 dex.&#10;The magnitude of this recalibration is shown as a red arrow in&#10;\[fig:stanley2015,fig:delvecchio2015\]. This serves to remove the known&#10;global systematic offset, making it simpler to focus on the trends with&#10;BHAR that are the topic of this paper.">
