<outline text="Discussion" _note="Throughout this investigation we have consistently found no evidence&#10;supporting a simple underlying relationship between the rate of a&#10;galaxy’s star formation and the accretion rate of its central BH.&#10;Instead, a mutual dependence of each property upon the mass of the host&#10;halo yields a more complex connection. It is interesting to examine,&#10;then, how the relation between the SFR and BHAR evolves for individual&#10;objects. In the following discussion, we will provide a physical&#10;interpretation based on the (hereafter B16) model for BH growth .&#10;However, we stress the simulation results are themselves independent of&#10;any physical interpretation.&#10;&#10;\[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_av\] equates the median trends of the SFR and BHAR&#10;histories shown in \[fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm\]. This specifies the 100 Myr&#10;average SFR as a function of the 100 Myr average BHAR in equal spacings&#10;of halo mass. Three distinct trends between SFR and BHAR emerge as the&#10;halo evolves: the STELLAR FEEDBACK REGULATED phase (shaded blue), the&#10;NON-LINEAR BH GROWTH phase (shaded green) and the AGN FEEDBACK REGULATED&#10;phase (shaded red).&#10;&#10;REGION A - THE STELLAR FEEDBACK REGULATED PHASE: From the time of their&#10;seeding until they are hosted by haloes of mass the BH accretion rates&#10;are negligible (on average). By contrast, SFRs increase steadily with&#10;halo mass. This behaviour produces the uncorrelated (yet causally&#10;connected) vertical trend in region A, creating an imbalance of growth&#10;within these systems. As a result, BHs remain close to their seed mass&#10;whilst the halo/galaxy continues to grow around them (see the low-mass&#10;region of \[fig:bhm\_vs\_hm\]).&#10;&#10;B16 interpret galaxies in this regime as being in a state of regulatory&#10;equilibrium. Energy injected by stars heats the ISM within the stellar&#10;vicinity, ejecting it, and causing it to rise buoyantly in the halo.&#10;This in turn creates an outflow of material balancing the freshly&#10;sourced fuel from the cosmic web, and as such prevents large gas&#10;densities from building up within the inner regions of these low-mass&#10;galaxies. Such low densities, coupled with the relatively low mass BHs&#10;living within these galaxies (BHAR ), ensures that BHs fail to grow&#10;substantially.&#10;&#10;REGION B - THE NON-LINEAR BH GROWTH PHASE: Both galaxies and BHs grow&#10;through the halo mass range . However, whereas the SFRs continue to&#10;increase steadily with increasing halo mass, BHs rapidly transition to a&#10;non-linear phase of growth. This creates a highly non-linear INDIRECT&#10;correlation between SFR and BHAR, connected through the host halo mass.&#10;&#10;The physical interpretation posited by B16 is that haloes that grow to&#10;the transition mass, , have become sufficiently massive to stall the&#10;regulatory outflow. Due to (what is now) the halos’ hot coronae, heated&#10;gas ejected by stellar feedback loses the capability to rise buoyantly&#10;and therefore returns to the galaxy centre. Densities in the central&#10;regions of the galaxy are no longer kept low and a to non-linear BH&#10;growth is triggered.&#10;&#10;REGION C - THE AGN FEEDBACK REGULATED PHASE: For haloes with masses&#10;above SFRs and BHARs both decline on average, correlated with an&#10;approximately linear trend (compare to green dashed line, see also&#10;bottom panel of \[fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm\]).&#10;&#10;B16 argue that BHs in these haloes have become sufficiently massive&#10;(through their rapid non-linear growth) to efficiently regulate the gas&#10;inflow onto the galaxy themselves via AGN feedback. This again creates&#10;an equilibrium state, for which a fluctuating low level of (specific) BH&#10;accretion is maintained, keeping the outer halo hot and evaporating much&#10;of the new cold material trying to enter the system from the&#10;intergalactic medium.&#10;&#10;Galaxies and their central BHs within the simulation transition through&#10;multiple stages of growth as their host dark matter halo evolves,&#10;creating three distinct behaviours between SFR and BHAR. This is a stark&#10;contrast to a simple model where SFR and BHAR correlate globally via a&#10;linear relation, on average and for all halo masses. Whilst the&#10;underlying trend is only revealed when each growth rate is time-averaged&#10;(given the inherent noise of instantaneous growth rates), we only find&#10;an approximately linear correlation for the most massive systems ( ).&#10;&#10;In this paper we have emphasised the role of the halo and how its&#10;interaction with both SFR and BHAR shapes the growth rate relationship.&#10;However, additional factors may also contribute to the form this&#10;relationship takes. For example, find using a suite of isolated merger&#10;simulations at fixed halo mass, that alternate behaviours between SFR&#10;and BHAR before, during and after the merger proper collectively&#10;contribute to form a complex two-dimensional plane. Additionally, reveal&#10;the particular importance differing merger histories can have on&#10;significantly altering the growth rate history of both that of the&#10;galaxy and the central BH. However, the global influence of mergers upon&#10;galaxy and BH growth rates in a full cosmological context remains open&#10;for debate, and will be the subject of a future paper.">
