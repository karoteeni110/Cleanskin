Firstly, we explore the versus BHAR relation for the&#10;AGN SELECTED sample presented by . Secondly, we explore the versus SFR&#10;relation for the SFR SELECTED sample presented by . Together they&#10;represent two of the largest sample sizes of their respective selection&#10;techniques, spanning multiple epochs. Large sample sizes such as these&#10;are key in overcoming the uncertainties inherent to low number&#10;statistics and in mitigating the potential redshift evolution biases&#10;that could be misinterpreted as an underlying trend.&#10;&#10;As mentioned in \[sect:individual\_galaxies\], SFRs obtained via FIR&#10;tracers most likely probe the recent star formation history of a galaxy,&#10;rather than an instantaneous value. Therefore the comparative SFRs of&#10;galaxies used in the analysis of \[fig:stanley2015,fig:delvecchio2015\]&#10;are the time-averaged rate over the 100 Myr preceding the instantaneous&#10;BHAR measurement. However, when performing the equivalent analysis using&#10;the instantaneous values of SFR at the time of the BHAR measurement we&#10;find no difference in the result, attesting to the stability of star&#10;formation as a process.">

This is considerably flatter than one would predict for a&#10;linear – relation from a co-evolution of growth, which we represent as a&#10;dashed green line[^1] (see \[sect:motivation\]).

    <outline text="BHAR as a function of SFR for a SFR selected sample" _note="The study of consists of star-forming galaxies detected out to . The&#10;selection limits in SFR are redshift dependent, corresponding to 0.2,&#10;1.0, 3.0, 8.0 and 25.0 for the five redshift ranges covered by this&#10;study from low to high respectively. We note that the data points from&#10;are segregated also in stellar mass, however for simplicity we make no&#10;such distinction.&#10;&#10;The comparison is shown in \[fig:delvecchio2015\], showing the MEAN BHAR&#10;as a function of SFR as the solid black line. Again, shows a good&#10;consistency with the observational measurements (shown in red), only&#10;over predicting in the lowest redshift range (). However, mentions that&#10;the limited co-moving volume of this study at low redshift could&#10;potentially exclude the most luminous sources. The behaviour of the –SFR&#10;relation is quite different from the –BHAR relation seen in&#10;\[fig:stanley2015\], adhering much closer to a linear trend. We see,&#10;uniformly, gradients close to unity (, see \[table:slopes\]) in good&#10;agreement with the linear – relation expected for a co-evolution of&#10;growth, shown as a dashed green line (note again the same dynamic range&#10;is used for both axes). An additional difference is the spread of values&#10;in the minimisation axis (for this figure). The distribution of SFRs in&#10;\[fig:delvecchio2015\] span a relatively narrow dynamic range, whereas&#10;here, BHARs vary as much as  dex in the percentile region. In fact, the&#10;dynamic range of BHARs is so large that the small fraction of galaxies&#10;whose values dominate the mean are able to pull it outside this&#10;percentile range entirely in some places, suggesting the median to be a&#10;more suitable statistic to measure this trend.&#10;&#10;Overall the agreement between and the observations is excellent,&#10;particularly given that no information regarding this relation was&#10;considered during the calibration procedure. The difference in behaviour&#10;found empirically via alternate selection criteria is well reproduced by&#10;the simulation. We find, consistent with the model and findings by ,&#10;that –BHAR for an AGN selected sample exhibits a relatively flat trend&#10;(), whilst that of with respect to SFR for a SFR selected sample is&#10;substantially steeper and close to unity (). However, within the&#10;paradigm of a linear – relation created through co-evolution of growth&#10;these results are both predicted to be linear (i.e, for both, see&#10;\[sect:motivation\]). Therefore either the underlying relationship&#10;itself is fundamentally non-linear, or a fuller understanding of the two&#10;processes is required. In the next section we continue to examine&#10;potential reasons as to the cause of this difference.">

  <outline text="Understanding the BHAR-SFR relationship" _note="In this section we explore two potential reasons why the –BHAR and –SFR&#10;trends are not each consistent with a linear relationship. We examine&#10;the hypothesis that (1) growth rates have an underlying linear&#10;connection only on average, which is masked when the unstable growth&#10;rate is observed instantaneously and (2) how selection biases due to the&#10;inability to probe the complete SFR–BHAR plane may play a role.">
    <outline text="A time-averaged SFR–BHAR connection" _note=" suggested that an underlying correlation held between a stable&#10;(galactic star formation) and unstable (BH accretion) process ON AVERAGE&#10;could be washed out if the unstable property is measured&#10;instantaneously. That is to say, if one could observe X-ray luminosities&#10;of AGN sources over prolonged periods, the underlying relationship&#10;between the two properties would begin to emerge. Indeed, with a simple&#10;model that assumes SFR and BHAR are connected on average with a linear&#10;scaling over a period of 100 Myr, reproduce the empirical behaviours of&#10;both the –BHAR and –SFR relationships whilst retaining a scenario&#10;consistent with a linear co-evolution between galaxies and their central&#10;BHs. While it is not possible to test observationally due to the length&#10;of these timescales, we are able to test this hypothesis using the&#10;simulation.&#10;&#10;\[fig:avandinst\] is similar to the upper left panel of&#10;\[fig:stanley2015\]. The region in blue, with the black solid line,&#10;shows the original analysis of the –BHAR relation for the redshift range&#10;using instantaneous BHARs and SFRs that are time-averaged 100 Myr before&#10;the BH event. Overlaid in red, with the mean represented by a dashed&#10;line, is the same selection of galaxies (i.e, instantaneous ) with each&#10;growth rate now time-averaged over 100 Myr. Interestingly, although the&#10;high BHARs shift systematically to lower values on average[^1], both the&#10;dynamic range and slope of the mean remain broadly consistent with their&#10;instantaneous equivalents (, see \[table:slopes\]). This behaviour&#10;remains for each redshift range explored by (see \[table:slopes\]). An&#10;alternate approach is to select galaxies in excess of on average (rather&#10;than instantaneously as done above) or indeed to prolong the averaging&#10;timescale to  Myrs. However in each case, and for all redshift&#10;intervals, the gradient values remain well below unity (). This leads us&#10;to conclude that the average galaxy and BH growth rates for an AGN&#10;selected sample do not harbour an underlying global linear relationship.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The shift (0.5 dex) to lower values in BHAR when averaging over&#10;    100 Myr arises due to the most luminous commonly residing in peaks&#10;    of the accretion rate history.">

    <outline text="Sampling different regions of the entire SFR-BHAR plane" _note="As observational surveys are subject to various flux limitations, they&#10;can only sample particular regions of the full SFR–BHAR plane. If the&#10;global underlying relation is linear, and each property exhibits a&#10;moderate scatter, each sub sample should also return a linear result.&#10;However, as the findings of previous sections do not to support an&#10;underlying linear relation, and because the scatter is large, it is&#10;important to investigate the effect of this sampling.&#10;&#10;\[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_z1\] shows the complete SFR–BHAR plane for all&#10;central galaxies at . In order to eliminate any potential bias incurred&#10;via redshift evolution in either growth rate we consider a discrete&#10;redshift rather than the continuous ranges of \[sect:observations\].&#10;Each data point represents the INSTANTANEOUS state of a single galaxy&#10;and its central BH, coloured by the halo mass. Values that are below&#10; for and  for are treated as and are clipped to these values. The&#10;approximate flux limit of the AGN selected sample by is shown as a solid&#10;vertical line and the approximate flux limit of the SFR selected sample&#10;by is shown as a horizontal solid line.&#10;&#10;It is further apparent that the global relationship between SFR and BHAR&#10;is not simply linear (reference with the dashed green line). Instead, a&#10;complicated relationship arises due to an amalgamation of three distinct&#10;behaviours of BH growth dependent on the mass of the host dark matter&#10;halo (see next section). It is therefore crucial to consider the&#10;particular region sampled before arriving at a particular conclusion.&#10;AGN selected samples, such as that of , currently probe a relatively&#10;limited region at the tip of the SFR–BHAR plane. With the exception of a&#10;few sources with rates , galaxies satisfying this selection criteria are&#10;distributed over a relatively narrow range of SFRs. As such, each bin of&#10;BHAR yields a very similar value of , creating an approximately flat&#10;trend. SFR selected samples, such as that of , sample a not too&#10;dissimilar distribution of SFRs (this time due to the flux limit),&#10;however, the distribution of BHARs is much wider. This in turn yields a&#10;steeper relation. We note, that whilst the mean SFR provides a good&#10;proxy of the median SFR for an AGN selected study (compare columns 3 and&#10;6 of \[table:slopes\]), the mean BHAR for a SFR selected study is not a&#10;good proxy of the median value due to the distribution of BHARs having&#10;such a large scatter (compare columns 8 and 10 of \[table:slopes\]).&#10;Although only the results from have been shown here, when investigated&#10;we find the results remain true independent of redshift.&#10;&#10;We therefore conclude that the different behaviour found for the –BHAR&#10;and –SFR relations recovered by observational studies is due to sampling&#10;considerably different regions of the full (not universally linear)&#10;SFR–BHAR plane. We now continue to investigate the nature of this&#10;relationship in the simulation and its evolution through time.">

  <outline text="The connection to the host dark matter halo" _note="The relationship between SFR and BHAR seen in \[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_z1\]&#10;is complicated, seemingly not adhering to a simple universal trend.&#10;However, there is evidence that each property has a link with the mass&#10;of the host dark matter halo, highlighted in the change of the data&#10;point colours, which transition smoothly from blue to red with&#10;increasing SFR, and systematically shift rightward in BHAR (with a large&#10;scatter) at high halo mass.&#10;&#10;To examine this in more depth we sub categorize the central galaxies&#10;into five continuous ranges of halo mass, showing the growth rates in&#10;\[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_byhalo\]. Here we find, in fact, that the global&#10;make up of the SFR–BHAR plane in \[fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_z1\] is resolved&#10;into a collection of two dimensional strips, wide in their dynamic range&#10;of BHAR ( dex) yet generally much more compact in their SFR ( dex). Each&#10;strip hosts a characteristic value of SFR (defined as the mode of the&#10;distribution, shown as a horizontal solid red line) that continuously&#10;increases with increasing halo mass. This is in line with the , where&#10;galaxies of increased stellar mass are seen to host larger SFRs .&#10;Interestingly, the rate of change with for this characteristic SFR does&#10;not remain constant, initially increasing by dex between and reducing to&#10;almost zero in the regime . This is potential evidence that SFRs in&#10;massive systems are not keeping pace with the increasing baryonic inflow&#10;rates for increasing halo mass at fixed redshift . BHARs show a less&#10;continuous behaviour however, broadly categorized by two rudimentary&#10;states: BHs residing in haloes below are typically accreting at a rate&#10;( ); BHs residing in haloes more massive than tend to be accreting at a&#10;rate ( ). The fraction of galaxies with for a given halo mass bin is 3%,&#10;21%, 55%, 70% and 78% from to respectively. Those in haloes between the&#10;mass range are in an intermediate state.&#10;&#10;A fraction of galaxies hosted by haloes with harbour extremely low, or&#10;even zero SFRs. As all of these galaxies host massive BHs ( , green&#10;dots), we are most likely seeing the effect of recent episodes of&#10;violent AGN feedback that have severely reduced the current star-forming&#10;capabilities of these systems. The cause, prevalence and impact of these&#10;feedback events will be the subject of a future paper.&#10;&#10;We now investigate if the growth rate to halo connection evolves. To do&#10;this we return to the – relation shown for in \[fig:bhm\_vs\_hm\]. The&#10;population is sub divided into two-dimensional bins, 0.5 dex on a side&#10;and outlined as squares. Here we investigate nine bins that lie along&#10;the median track through a continuous range spanning in halo mass and in&#10;BH mass, each outlined with a unique colour to reference their histories&#10;in \[fig:one\_square,fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm,fig:sfr\_vs\_bhar\_av\].&#10;&#10;\[fig:one\_square\] shows the evolution of the time-averaged SFR (top&#10;panel) and time-averaged BHAR (bottom panel) as a function of halo mass&#10;for all galaxies that come to reside in one of these two-dimensional&#10;bins at the present day (each solid black line is an individual&#10;history). We time-average both SFR and BHAR over 100 Myr in order to&#10;remove the inherent noise when considering instantaneous growth rates,&#10;and unveil the average trend. To eliminate galaxies that were previously&#10;classified as satellites of a more massive halo, we only consider&#10;central galaxies that have evolved monotonically in their halo mass&#10;(this excludes only of the centrals population). We see, that although&#10;individual histories can be quite different, on average galaxies and&#10;their central BHs do follow a well defined path. The median SFR and BHAR&#10;of this population subset for a given halo mass are over-plotted in&#10;yellow, annotated by the median redshift at which they were hosted by&#10;haloes of that particular mass. As expected, an increasing halo mass&#10;corresponds to a decreasing redshift.&#10;&#10;There is a striking difference in behaviour seen between the two growth&#10;rates as the halo grows. Initially the SFR increases steadily with halo&#10;mass. As the halo grows more massive than the SFRs begin to fluctuate&#10;between high and low values, yet overall there is a gradual decline of&#10;the median trend after this mass. Similarly, BHARs also change their&#10;behaviour around , rapidly transitioning from a low () to high () rate.&#10;As with SFRs, BHARs decline a similar amount after the halo mass (note&#10;the many orders of magnitude difference in the scale of the growth rate&#10;axis between the two panels). We interpret therefore, given that the&#10;decline of SFR coincides with the peak of the rapid increase in BHAR,&#10;that AGN feedback is impeding the continued rise of SFRs in the most&#10;massive systems (see \[fig:variability\] for an individual example of&#10;SFR reduction after the peak AGN activity at lookback time ). We note&#10;that the decrease in halo mass accretion rate with declining redshift&#10;and the dependence of halo cooling rates on halo mass will play&#10;ADDITIONAL roles in shaping these histories. However, given the severity&#10;of the SFR reduction seen immediately after the BHAR peak, AGN feedback&#10;appears to be a dominant factor in hindering further galaxy growth.&#10;&#10;\[fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm\] extends this analysis to each of the&#10;highlighted two-dimensional bins in \[fig:bhm\_vs\_hm\], now showing&#10;only the median lines for clarity. Remarkably, the evolutionary&#10;behaviour is similar regardless of the final position in the – plane.&#10;The normalisation of each history is set by the evolving baryonic inflow&#10;rate at fixed halo mass. As this rate decreases with redshift , so does&#10;the normalisation of both the SFR and BHAR seen here (as each population&#10;reaches a particular halo mass at different times). We include also in&#10;the bottom panel of \[fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm\] the median ratio between&#10;SFR and BHAR shown in the two panels above. This shows that galaxy&#10;growth is dominant over BH growth by many orders of magnitude in low&#10;mass haloes ( ). As BHARs settle to their rate in haloes of a mass above&#10;, the ratio between SFR and BHAR plateaus to an approximately constant&#10;value of . Note the trends of both&#10;\[fig:one\_square,fig:avHistory\_vs\_hm\] are not directly observable as&#10;they rely on median time-averaged growth rates in both SFR and BHAR of&#10;100 Myr whilst also being binned by halo mass.">
