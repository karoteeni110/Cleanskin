    <title> Effect of Cell-Selection on the Effective Fading Distribution in a
Downlink -tier HetNet</title>
    <abstract>This paper characterizes the statistics of effective fading gain in
multi-tier cellular networks with strongest base station (BS) cell
association policy. First, we derive the probability of association with
the -th nearest BS in the -th tier. Next, we use this result to derive
the probability density function (PDF) of the channel fading gain
(effective fading) experienced by the user when associating with the
strongest BS. Interestingly, our results show that the effective channel
gain distribution solely depends upon the original channel fading and
the path-loss exponent. Moreover, we show that in the case of Nakagami-
fading channels (Gamma distribution), the distribution of the effective
fading is also Gamma but with a gain of in the shape parameter, where is
the path-loss exponent. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="With the dawn of fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems almost upon us,&#10;we are currently witnessing unprecedented changes in the cellular&#10;use-cases and consequently the architecture of cellular networks. In the&#10;context of this letter, two parallel trends are of particular interest.&#10;First, cell sizes are shrinking due to the organic deployment of&#10;low-power BSs called small cells . Second, 5G may need to support&#10;mobility at speeds upto 500km/hour . These trends together mean that the&#10;mobile users may experience orders of magnitude higher handover rates&#10;compared to the current networks. This issue has indeed attracted a lot&#10;of attention, with cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) and more&#10;recently Fog networks presented as possible solutions . The occurrence&#10;of more frequent handovers necessitates the need to understand the&#10;system characteristics [DURING]{} the handover phase, which we refer to&#10;as the [CELL SELECTION PHASE]{}. In this letter, we focus on&#10;characterizing the distribution of fading gain experienced by a mobile&#10;user during the cell selection phase, which we term as [EFFECTIVE FADING&#10;GAIN]{}. Due to the occurence of [ORDER STATISTICS]{} in cell selection,&#10;the effective fading gain is shown to deviate significantly from the&#10;fading gain observed by the users at other times (when they are not&#10;performing cell selection), which is referred to as [ORIGINAL FADING&#10;GAIN]{}. It is worth noting that this problem has never been studied&#10;before perhaps because it was not quite as meaningful in conventional&#10;cellular networks that had far lower handover rates.&#10;&#10;Although this exact problem has not been studied before, order&#10;statistics have been used to study several problems that have a somewhat&#10;similar flavor . For instance, in multi-antenna receivers, it is&#10;important to exploit the existence of multiple paths by optimally&#10;combining them in order to enhance the performance gain. This is usually&#10;achieved by giving larger weights to the [STRONGEST]{} paths . Also in&#10;multi-user systems, similar procedure appears during scheduling when the&#10;transmitter picks the users with [STRONGEST]{} channel state . Similar&#10;to diversity techniques, selecting stronger users during scheduling&#10;necessitates using order statistics in the analysis. Similar decision&#10;needs to be made during [CELL SELECTION]{} in cellular networks, which&#10;is the main focus of this letter. The usual procedure is to measure the&#10;received signal strengths from all nearby BSs at the mobile user and&#10;then attach it to the BS that provides the strongest signal. While this&#10;typically reduces to closest-BS association in conventional single-tier&#10;cellular networks, the same is not true in multi-tier HetNets due to&#10;different transmit powers across tiers . Assuming same fading gain&#10;statistics across all wireless links, in this letter we study the effect&#10;of cell selection procedure on the [EFFECTIVE]{} fading gain observed at&#10;the mobile user.&#10;&#10;CONTRIBUTIONS. Using tools from stochastic geometry , we characterize&#10;the PDF of the effective channel fading gain experienced by the typical&#10;user in a multi-tier cellular network during cell-selection phase under&#10;strongest-BS association policy. As an important intermediate result, we&#10;first derive the probability of association of the typical user with the&#10;-th nearest BS in the -th tier, which itself is a new and much finer&#10;characterization of association probabilities under strongest BS&#10;association policy in HetNets. Our results concretely demonstrate that&#10;the PDF solely depends upon the distribution of the original fading gain&#10;and the path-loss exponent (does not depend upon infrastructure&#10;properties, such as the number of BS tiers, their densities, or their&#10;transmission powers). In addition, if we assume independent Nakagami-&#10;fading (Gamma distribution) over all links, the resulting effective&#10;fading is also Gamma distributed with the same scale parameter but a&#10;gain of in the shape parameter.">

<outline text="System Model" _note="We consider a -tier cellular network were the locations of BSs in each&#10;tier are modeled by an independent Poisson point process (PPP) with&#10;density . The transmission power of BSs in the -th tier is . The&#10;locations of all BSs can then be modeled by the PPP , where is the set&#10;of indices of the tiers. The locations of the users are modeled by an&#10;independent PPP with density . Without loss of generality, the analysis&#10;is performed at an arbitrarily chosen user (termed [TYPICAL]{} user),&#10;whose position can be translated to the origin due to the stationarity&#10;of this setup. The received signal power at the typical user from a -th&#10;tier BS located at is , where models fading gain and represents standard&#10;power-law pathloss with exponent . To differentiate it from the&#10;[EFFECTIVE]{} fading gain studied in the next Section, we refer to as&#10;the [ORIGINAL]{} fading gain. For notational ease, the set of all&#10;original fading gains , , over all links between the typical user and&#10;the BSs in the network is denoted by . It is assumed that is independent&#10;and identically distributed across all links with PDF and cumulative&#10;distribution function (CDF) . While all the results will be derived for&#10;this general distribution, we will also specialize them to Nakagami-&#10;fading case for providing insights and numerical comparisons. In this&#10;case, we have , which is Gamma distribution with scale parameter and&#10;shape parameter (i.e. ), where is the mean of (usually assumed to be in&#10;Nakagami- fading channels). Also . For cell selection, we assume that&#10;the typical user connects to the BS that provides maximum received&#10;power. For this setup, we define effective fading gain experienced at&#10;the typical user as follows.&#10;&#10;\[def:1\] The effective fading gain represents the fading gain&#10;experienced by the typical user during cell-selection phase when&#10;associating with the BS located at , where&#10;&#10;Note that, in principle, can be interpreted as the cumulative fading&#10;gain incorporating both slow and fast fading effects. This generality is&#10;mathematically provided by the general distribution of . Also note that&#10;the cell-selection policy can be specialized to both instantaneous and&#10;average power-based cell selection by choosing appropriate distribution&#10;.">

<outline text="Distribution of Effective Fading Gain" _note="Since fading gain appears in the cell selection criterion given by Eq.&#10;\[eq:cell\_selection\], the distribution of the effective fading gain&#10;experienced by the typical user will, in general, be different from the&#10;distribution of the original fading gain (due to the effect of order&#10;statistics). Before starting the derivation of the PDF of , we introduce&#10;an indicator function for which if the -th nearest BS in the -th tier is&#10;the serving BS and otherwise. This function can be expressed as where is&#10;an indicator function that equals to 1 when the condition is satisfied&#10;and equals to zero otherwise, and is the original fading gain for the&#10;channel between the typical user and the -th nearest BS in the -th tier.&#10;Using the above function, the CDF of is defined as follows: where&#10;follows from the fact that and are conditionally independent,&#10;conditioned on , and in is the probability of association with the -th&#10;nearest BS in the -th tier conditioned on . Hence, we first derive an&#10;expression for in Lemma \[lem:assoc\], using which we will derive the&#10;PDF of in Theorem \[thm:effective\_general\].">

  <outline text="Effective Fading Distribution Analysis" _note="In the following Theorem we provide the PDF of the effective fading gain&#10;in terms of general original fading.&#10;&#10;\[thm:effective\_general\] The PDF of the effective fading gain in a&#10;-tier network under general cell-selection policy given by&#10;Definition \[def:1\] is:&#10;&#10;See Appendix \[app:effective\].&#10;&#10;\[rem:alpha\_fading\_dist\] Note that in Eq. \[Eq\_theorem1\_1\] the&#10;distribution of the effective channel fading gain is agnostic of the&#10;number of tiers, the transmission powers, and the densities of the&#10;tiers. Interestingly, the distribution only depends on the original&#10;fading distribution and the path-loss exponent .&#10;&#10;In the case of Nakagami- fading, the distribution of the effective&#10;fading gain is presented in the following corollary.&#10;&#10;\[cor:effective\_nakagami\] In the case of Nakagami- original fading&#10;with , we have&#10;&#10;\[rem:m\_effect\] From Corollary \[cor:effective\_nakagami\], we note&#10;that in the case of Nakagami- original fading , the distribution of the&#10;effective fading gain is also Nakagami- but with a different shape&#10;parameter: . The gain in the shape parameter represents the decrease in&#10;the severity of the effective fading gain distribution as a result of&#10;base station selection. It is also noteworthy that this gain gets&#10;negligible as the value of gets larger.&#10;&#10;\[rem:SysDesign\] The reduction in the perceived severity of the fading&#10;at the receiver (discussed in Remark \[rem:m\_effect\]) can be used to&#10;lower the transmission power of the BS for about one channel coherence&#10;time immediately after the cell selection phase. This can be argued&#10;using multiple performance metrics. For instance, due to reduction in&#10;the channel fluctuations, one needs a relatively lower [FADE MARGIN]{}&#10;during this time, which directly translates to lower transmit power at&#10;the BS. Similarly, due to less severe fading, the [BIT ERROR RATE]{}&#10;will decrease, which means the BS can transmit at a lower power to&#10;achieve the same target bit error rate as before.">

Along&#10;with the analytical results, the simulation results are also provided&#10;for tiers. As discussed already in Remark \[rem:alpha\_fading\_dist\],&#10;these results do not depend upon the number of tiers (value of ), which&#10;was also verified separately with simulations. By comparing these&#10;distributions with the corresponding original fading distributions, we&#10;deduce that the PDF of almost coincides with the PDF of the original&#10;fading as the value of is increased, whereas they are significantly&#10;different for smaller values of . This is consistent with insights&#10;gained in Remark \[rem:m\_effect\].">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this letter, we derived the PDF of the effective fading gain observed&#10;by the typical user during the handover phase in a -tier HetNet under&#10;strongest-BS association policy. As an intermediate result (which is in&#10;fact important in its own right), we provided a much finer&#10;characterization of association probabilities by deriving the&#10;probability that the typical user is served by the -th nearest BS in the&#10;-th tier. Our results concretely demonstrate that the effective channel&#10;fading distribution during cell selection phase is significantly&#10;different from the original fading distribution. In fact, association&#10;with the strongest BS reduces perceived [SEVERITY]{} of fading in&#10;general due to order statistics. One useful consequence of this result&#10;is the possibility of lowering the transmit power of the serving BS to&#10;the typical user for about one channel coherence time immediately after&#10;the cell selection phase.">
