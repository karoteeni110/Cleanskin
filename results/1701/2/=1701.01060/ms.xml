    <title>A universal self-amplification channel for surface plasma waves</title>
    <abstract>We present a theory of surface plasma waves (SPWs) in metals with
arbitrary electronic collision rate . We show that there exists a
universal intrinsic amplification channel for these waves, subsequent to
the interplay between ballistic motions and the metal surface. We
evaluate the corresponding amplification rate , which turns out to be a
sizable fraction of the SPW frequency . We also find that the value of
depends on surface scattering properties, in contrast with the
conventional theory. </abstract>

<outline text="introduction" _note="Collective electronic oscillations on the surface of metals, dubbed&#10;surface plasma waves (SPWs) , have emerged as a pivotal player in&#10;NANOscopic manipulation of light . The functionality of many&#10;prototypical nanophotonic devices critically relies on the distance SPWs&#10;can travel before they are damped out due to energy losses via several&#10;channels . SPWs can lose energy due to Joule heat, inter-band&#10;absorption, radiation emission and individual electronic motions (Landau&#10;damping). Most of the losses can be efficiently but not totally reduced&#10;under appropriate circumstances. Amplifiers have been contrived to&#10;compensate for the losses , which are all extrinsic and require external&#10;agents such as a dipolar gain medium to supply the energy.&#10;&#10;The standard theory of SPWs was formulated shortly after their discovery&#10;in 1957  and has been comprehensively discoursed in many textbooks . In&#10;this theory, the electrical properties of metals are effected by a&#10;frequency-dependent dielectric function . To analytically treat , the&#10;simple Drude model or the slightly more involved hydrodynamic model  is&#10;invariably invoked. For either model to be valid, electronic collisions&#10;must be sufficiently frequent so that the electronic mean free path, ,&#10;where is the Fermi velocity and the relaxation time, is much shorter&#10;than the SPW wavelength or the typical length scale of the system. The&#10;general case with arbitrary , especially the collision-less limit, where&#10;, defies these models and has yet to be entertained. Other models based&#10;on AB INITIO quantum mechanical computations  are helpful in&#10;understanding the complexity of real materials but falls short in&#10;providing an intuitive and systematic picture of SPWs underpinned by&#10;electrons experiencing less frequent collisions.&#10;&#10;In the present work we employ Boltzmann’s transport equation to derive a&#10;theory of SPWs in metals with arbitrary . Our analysis reveals a&#10;universal intrinsic amplification channel for SPWs. The existence of&#10;this channel does not depend on but is warranted by a general principle.&#10;We show that the unique interplay between ballistic electronic motions&#10;and boundaries results in an electrical current that allows a net amount&#10;of energy to be drawn from the electrons by SPWs, which would inevitably&#10;self-amplify in the collision-less limit, thereby destabilizing the&#10;system. The hereby predicted self-amplification of collision-less SPWs&#10;is analogous to the Landau damping in collisionless bulk plasma waves .&#10;While the latter is caused by slowly moving electrons that strip energy&#10;from the wave, the former is attributable to ballistically moving&#10;electrons imparting energy to the wave when boundaries are present.&#10;&#10;In the next section, we describe the system under consideration, state&#10;our main results and conceive their possible experimental signature. In&#10;Sec. \[sec:theory\], the SPW theory is presented. In Sec. \[sec:3\], we&#10;detail the methods used in the theory. We discuss the results and&#10;conclude the paper in Sec. \[sec:4\].

<outline text="results" _note="SYSTEM - We consider a prototypical system, namely, a semi-infinite&#10;metal (SIM) occupying the half space and interfacing with the vacuum at&#10;a geometrical surface . A SIM is not sheerly of academic interest: it&#10;can be regarded as one half of a thick metal film. In the spirit of the&#10;so-called jellium model,  the metal is treated as a free electron gas&#10;embedded in a static background of uniformly distributed positive&#10;charges. On the whole the system is neutral. The kinetic energy of the&#10;electrons is written , where and denote the mass and velocity of the&#10;electrons, respectively. Inter-band transitions are accordingly ignored&#10;but their effects will be discussed in Sec. \[sec:4\]. The surface is of&#10;a hard-wall type and prevents electrons from leaking out of the system.&#10;Throughout we reserve for planar coordinates while denotes the complete&#10;position vector. We neglect retardation effects in total.&#10;&#10;KEY RESULTS - We find that the SPW frequency and its amplification rate&#10;can be written in the following form, Here is the SPW frequency in the&#10;hydrodynamic/Drude model, with being the characteristic frequency of the&#10;metal, is a parameter that accounts for surface scattering effects,&#10;weakly depends on and includes Landau damping and is exactly independent&#10;of . Both and are determined by the secular equation (\[spw\]) given in&#10;Sec. \[sec:3\]. Analytical expressions can be found for and under&#10;certain approximations. Exact and have been computed numerically and are&#10;displayed in Fig. \[figure:f0\], where we observe that , with .&#10;&#10;Equation (\[key\]) furnishes an intrinsic amplification channel for&#10;SPWs. It also shows that, in contrast to the hydrodynamic/Drude model,&#10;relies on surface properties via the parameter . In particular, as seen&#10;in Fig. \[figure:f0\] (a), is significantly – more than – larger than ,&#10;the value expected from the hydrodynamic/Drude model. In other words, is&#10;unity in these models whereas it could reach up to in our theory. Such a&#10;great contrast would be ideal for experimentally verifying the theory.&#10;Unfortunately, in common materials such as noble metals, due to&#10;pronounced inter-band transitions, there is no simple relation between&#10;and .&#10;&#10;EXPERIMENTAL SIGNATURE - We conceive one possible repercussion of the&#10;self-amplification channel, noting that the net amplification rate and&#10;its temperature dependence can be directly measured in various ways,&#10;e.g. by examining the SPW propagation distance or the width of the&#10;energy loss peaks in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) or the&#10;quality of the reflectance dips in the Kretschmann-Otto configuration.&#10;In this paper, our calculation of is done at zero temperature. However,&#10;arguably could bear a different – probably weak – temperature dependence&#10;than . In sufficiently pure samples, in which the residual scattering is&#10;small enough, there might exist a critical temperature , above which&#10;while below it , i.e. marks a transition of the system from the Fermi&#10;sea to another state, see Sec. \[sec:4\] for further discussions. In&#10;Fig. \[figure:f3\], we sketch the situation described here, assuming is&#10;dominated by phonon and impurity scattering.&#10;&#10;To experimentally investigate the self-amplification channel using the&#10;most experimented materials like gold and silver, we must clarify the&#10;effects of inter-band transitions, which not only bring about additional&#10;energy losses but also strongly affect the value of . We discuss these&#10;effects further in Sec. \[sec:4\].&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Theory" _note="In this section, we give a systematic exposition of the theory that&#10;supports equation (\[key\]). Some technical aspects are left to&#10;Sec. \[sec:3\]. The overall objective is to set up the equation of&#10;motion for the charge density, analyze its internal structure and solve&#10;it. We first discuss the relation between the charge density and the&#10;electric field, and then prescribes the current density and show that it&#10;possesses a spectacular structure. We proceed thence to the equation of&#10;motion, extracting its solutions and unveiling the properties of SPWs.&#10;&#10;ELECTROSTATICS - We aim for establishing the equation of motion for the&#10;charge density under the influence of its own electric field . Here&#10;denotes the time. Thanks to the linearity and symmetries of the system,&#10;we can write and without loss of generality. Here Re/Im takes the&#10;real/imaginary part of a quantity, denotes the wavenumber while is the&#10;SPW eigen-frequency to be determined by the equation of motion. In&#10;general, can be complex. Instead of , it proves more convenient to work&#10;directly with In order for the jellium model to be valid, we must impose&#10;that , where is a cut-off. roughly gives the microscopic lattice&#10;constant of the metal. We may choose , where is the Fermi wavelength and&#10;the mean electron density. The results do not depend on the exact value&#10;of as long as it is sufficiently large. By definition, In terms of , we&#10;can easily find, by solving Laplace’s equation, that A snapshot of for a&#10;typical SPW is displayed in Fig. \[figure:f1\] (a) and the magnitude of&#10;is plotted in (b). Of course, in making these plots has been determined&#10;by the equation of motion to be set up shortly.&#10;&#10;CURRENT DENSITIES - Under , an electrical current, of density , will&#10;flow. It can be calculated using Boltzmann’s transport equation, see&#10;Sec. \[sec:3\]. As a crucial observation, we find that can always be&#10;written in two disparate contributions, . What sets them apart is their&#10;distinct relations to , as illustrated in Fig. \[figure:f2\]. It turns&#10;out that follows almost locally, as in the conventional&#10;hydrodynamic/Drude model – which is applicable only when electrons&#10;execute diffusive motions, i.e. is very small. Explicitly, can be&#10;written where , is the characteristic plasma frequency of the metal and&#10;signifies a non-local contribution that generates dispersive plasma&#10;waves, with Here denotes the Fermi-Dirac distribution and its&#10;derivative, which is to be taken at zero temperature in this paper. Only&#10;terms with odd in the series contribute. One can show that . The factor&#10;heading in Eq. (\[jd\]) is recognized as the Drude conductivity. As this&#10;conductivity is nearly imaginary, points almost perpendicular to , as&#10;seen in Fig. \[figure:f2\] (a).&#10;&#10;In contrast, – the ’surface-ballistic’ current – has no simple relation&#10;with and reflects genuine surface effects: would totally disappear if&#10;the surface were absent. While is essentially a bulk property,&#10;originates from the interplay between ballistic motions and the surface.&#10;It consists of two parts, where (z) is contributed by electrons directly&#10;emerging at the surface while by reflected electrons. Here is the FUCHS&#10;parameter, which gauges the probability that an electron impinging on&#10;the surface gets reflected back. Both contributions arise from electrons&#10;moving away from the surface, . In fact, where and with For and small ,&#10;it is easy to show that , implying that points normal to the surface.&#10;This is illustrated in Fig. \[figure:f2\] (b).&#10;&#10;POSITIVENESS OF - Equation (\[5\]) strongly constrains the value of .&#10;Actually, it requires that Im; otherwise, the integral in this equation&#10;would diverge for any , because diverges exponentially for . In&#10;Sec. \[sec:3\] and Appendix \[sec:edf\], this point is further&#10;elaborated. Since the fact that Im suggests an intrinsic amplification&#10;channel competing with the loss channel . In what follows, we show that&#10;is independent of by means of the equation of motion.&#10;&#10;EQUATION OF MOTION - The equation of motion can be obtained by relating&#10;and via the equation of continuity, which is derived and discussed in&#10;the next section. Here . Substituting into this equation and Fourier&#10;transforming it, we arrive at where counts as a source term and are the&#10;elements of a matrix denoted by , with See that is an even function of&#10;and depends on the length but not the direction of . The matrix arises&#10;from with elements given in Sec. \[sec:3\]. In Appendix \[sec:M\], we&#10;show that , where is a constant and is the unity matrix will all&#10;elements being one. It makes only a minor correction to the diagonal&#10;matrix with elements .&#10;&#10;The equation of motion (\[eom\]) can now be re-cast in a compact matrix&#10;form, where is the identity matrix, is a column vector collecting all&#10;and is a column vector with all elements being one. For later use, the&#10;source term can be rewritten where is another column vector, takes the&#10;transpose, and with arising from and from . Here Equations (\[eom\]) -&#10;(\[gb\]) are exact and do not explicitly involve , thereby concluding&#10;that is independent of .&#10;&#10;BULK MODES AND LOCALIZED MODES - Without the surface we have and .&#10;Equation (\[eom\]) reduces to for any , which all are extended modes and&#10;therefore describe cosine bulk plasma waves. If we discretize in step ,&#10;in total there are such modes. Solving this equation, we find the&#10;dispersion relation for these modes. Generally, could possess an&#10;imaginary part due to a pole, located at , of the integrand in the&#10;integral involved in , giving rise to the celebrated Landau damping.&#10;Neglecting this, one obtains for small which was well known from the&#10;hydrodynamic/Drude model.&#10;&#10;In the presence of the surface, equation (\[eom\]) admits not only&#10;extended modes, for which , but also localized modes, for which . The&#10;number of total modes cannot change and is still . The extended modes&#10;again represent bulk waves and for them equation (\[eomb\]) reduces to .&#10;As shown in Appendix \[sec:M\], because of the constraint that , there&#10;are in total at most solutions to this equation. The number of total&#10;bulk modes is then reduced by one from that without the surface. Their&#10;dispersion relation is negligibly affected by and still given by .&#10;&#10;The missing bulk mode has been converted into a localized mode&#10;satisfying and representing SPWs, for which equation (\[eomb\]) yields&#10;Plugging this in Eq. (\[s\]), we obtain which determines and hence the&#10;SPW eigen-frequency . Upon omitting from , this equation becomes Let us&#10;write the solution as and hence with . See that the solutions occur&#10;together, in accord with the fact that is a real-valued field. In&#10;Eq. (\[spw\]), is generally complex and automatically includes Landau&#10;damping.&#10;&#10;HYDRODYNAMIC/DRUDE LIMITS - The hydrodynamic model is revisited if we&#10;replace in Eq. (\[spw\]) and with and given by Eq. (\[hydro\]),&#10;respectively. If we further disregard the dispersion in , the Drude&#10;model is then recovered, in which case we immediately find . In both&#10;models, is real.&#10;&#10;APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS - We can solve Eq. (\[spw\]) approximately. To the&#10;lowest order in , which is assumed to be small, we may determine by&#10;approximating the real part of (\[spw\]) as follows Substituting the&#10;so-obtained in the imaginary part of (\[spw\]), we find which can be&#10;brought into a rather simple form if we take and . Namely, In this&#10;approximation, could have an imaginary part only if . Landau damping&#10;would be excluded from otherwise.&#10;&#10;To proceed, we need to evaluate . To the linear order in , we find&#10;Carrying out the integral gives Thus, Re. Inserting this in&#10;Eq. (\[18\]), we get We see that generally depends on surface scattering&#10;effects, in contrast with what is expected of the hydrodynamic/Drude&#10;model. Analogously, using Eq. (\[gamma0\]) and , we find , with . Landau&#10;damping has been excluded here, as the approximation only takes the real&#10;part of .&#10;&#10;NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS - Equation (\[spw\]) can also be exactly solved&#10;numerically. A comparison with the approximate solution is displayed in&#10;Fig. \[figure:f0\]. The agreement in the matter of is satisfactory,&#10;while that for is not. The discrepancy might be because the approximate&#10;solution excludes Landau damping. It should be emphasized that, our&#10;numerical solutions do not depend on the choice of , provided the latter&#10;is big enough, i.e. .">

<outline text="Methods" _note="This section discusses further some technical aspects of the theory. We&#10;set out with a discussion of the equation of continuity in the presence&#10;of surfaces. Then we describe Boltzmann’s equation and solve it to&#10;obtain the electronic distribution functions. Thence we derive the&#10;dynamic equation for the charge density.&#10;&#10;EQUATION OF CONTINUITY - We start with the equation of continuity, ,&#10;which relates the charge density and the current density in a generic&#10;way. Here the damping term is included to account for electronic&#10;collisions that would drive the system toward equilibrium. In the&#10;jellium model, appears when the electron density is disturbed away from&#10;its equilibrium value . The surface prevents any electrons from leaking&#10;out of the metal. Explicitly, we write , where is the Heaviside step&#10;function. In so doing, we have treated the surface as a hard wall and&#10;considered the fact that may not vanish even in the immediate&#10;neighborhood of the surface – which is obviously the case with the&#10;hydrodynamic/Drude model. The equation of continuity becomes where&#10;denotes a point on the surface and is the Dirac function peaked on the&#10;surface. Physically, the right hand side of Eq. (\[eoc\]) means that,&#10;charges must pile up on the surface if they do not come to a halt before&#10;they reach it.&#10;&#10;Equation (\[eoc\]) reduces to equation (\[eocc\]) upon using the plane&#10;wave form for and .&#10;&#10;BOLTZMANN’S APPROACH - We employ Boltzmann’s equation to calculate as a&#10;response to . On the microscopic level, we may introduce a surface&#10;potential into the equation to account for surface scattering effects.&#10;The corresponding surface field is peaked on the surface and, complying&#10;with the hard-wall picture, may have an infinitesimal spread .&#10;Unfortunately, as can hardly be known and varies from one sample to&#10;another, this microscopic method is impractical and futile.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, surface scattering effects can be dealt with using&#10;boundary conditions . This is possible because acts only on the surface.&#10;In the bulk, the solutions – the electronic distribution function – to&#10;Boltzmann’s equation can be uniquely determined up to some parameters,&#10;which summarize the effects of – while without actually knowing – . With&#10;translational symmetry along the surface, only one such parameter,&#10;namely, the so-called FUCHS parameter , is needed for the simple&#10;specular scattering picture. Physically, measures the probability that&#10;an electron impinging upon the surface is bounced back. As usual, we&#10;write , where is the non-equilibrium part of the distribution function&#10;in the presence of . The current density can then be calculated by ,&#10;where denotes the electron charge. It is worth pointing out that, as is&#10;a distribution only for the bulk, the charge density is not given by ,&#10;i.e. . Actually, It is easy to see that satisfies rather than&#10;Eq. (\[eoc\]). Obviously, what is missing from is exactly the charges&#10;just localized on the surface.&#10;&#10;ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION - Let us write Re . In the regime of&#10;linear responses, Boltzmann’s equation reads where . In this equation,&#10;the velocity is more of a parameter than an argument and can be used to&#10;tag electron beams. It is straightforward to solve the equation under&#10;appropriate boundary conditions (Appendix \[sec:edf\]). Naturally, we&#10;have where the bulk term would exist even in the absence of surfaces&#10;whereas the surface term would not. Using the expressions for , we&#10;obtain which has the same form as one would expect for a bulk system.&#10;Here we have defined .&#10;&#10;As for , we find it with a subtle structure: it can be written as a sum&#10;of two contributions, one of which, , has a single form for all&#10;electrons irrespective of their velocities while the other, , does not.&#10;Explicitly, we have We may combine and in a single term, in order to&#10;separate them from In so doing, we have decomposed in a diffusive and a&#10;ballistic component. It is underlined that arises only when the surfaces&#10;are present. For bulk systems without surfaces, it does not exist even&#10;if the electronic motions are totally ballistic, i.e. . As such, we call&#10;it ’surface-ballistic’.&#10;&#10; exists only for electrons leaving the surface, i.e. . Those electrons&#10;could directly emerge from the surface or be those incident on but&#10;subsequently get reflected by the surface. What fundamentally sets apart&#10;from rest with its simple dependence. Actually, we have where the FUCHS&#10;parameter gauges the fraction of reflected electrons and has been given&#10;in Eq. (\[g\]). As already remarked, since , we must have ; otherwise,&#10;it would diverge either when or for small . In Appendix \[sec:edf\], we&#10;argue that this result is a consequence of the causality principle,&#10;which states that the number of reflected electrons is determined by&#10;that of incident electrons, rather than otherwise.&#10;&#10;DIVERGENCE OF THE CURRENT DENSITIES - The current density is split in&#10;two parts: and , where . Using the expressions for , it is&#10;straightforward to obtain given by Eq. (\[jd\]) and by Eq. (\[5\]). To&#10;obtain the equation of motion (\[eom\]) from the equation of continuity&#10;(\[eocc\]), the Fourier transform of is needed. We find with given by&#10;Eq. (\[Omega\]). Additionally, where is a matrix given by where In&#10;Appendix \[sec:M\], we show that generally makes a minor correction, of&#10;the order of , to . Ultimately, the insignificance of this correction&#10;may be ascribed to the factor in , which is extremely oscillatory over&#10;with a period less than .&#10;&#10;Substituting Eqs. \[dd\] and (\[30\]) in the equation of continuity, we&#10;immediately obtain the equation of motion (\[eom\]).">

<outline text="discussions and conclusions" _note="Thus, on the basis of Boltzmann’s equation, we have established a&#10;rigorous theory for SPWs in metals with arbitrary electronic collision&#10;rate . As a key consequence of the theory, we find that there exists a&#10;self-amplification channel for SPWs, which would cause the latter to&#10;spontaneously amplify at a rate if not for electronic collisions.&#10;Surprisingly, the value of turns out to be independent of . The presence&#10;of this channel is guaranteed by the causality principle.&#10;&#10;Whether the system could actually amplify or not depends on the&#10;competition between and . If , SPWs will amplify and the system will&#10;become unstable. In our theory, the non-equilibrium deviation refers to&#10;the Fermi-Dirac distribution ; as such, the instability is one of the&#10;Fermi sea. Needless to say, the instability will be terminated once the&#10;system deviates far enough from the Fermi sea and settles in a stable&#10;state. Clarifying the nature of the destination state is a subject of&#10;crucial importance for future study.&#10;&#10;One central feature of our theory is the classification of current&#10;densities into a diffusive component and a surface-ballistic component .&#10;This classification is not based on the value of but according to&#10;whether the component obeys the (generalized) Ohm’s law or not. Apart&#10;from this, these components are also discriminated in other ways.&#10;Firstly, they are controlled by different length scales. As it largely&#10;follows the local electric field , the characteristic length associated&#10;with is . On the other hand, the length for is , because of its simple&#10;-dependence. Secondly, they are oriented disparately. is largely&#10;oriented normal to locally whereas normal to the surfaces – especially&#10;for close to unity. Thirdly, is a bulk property and exists regardless of&#10;the surface; On the contrary, reflects true surface effects and it would&#10;disappear without surfaces.&#10;&#10;If we replace the vacuum by a dielectric , may be reduced by an order of&#10;  due to weakened and . Roughly speaking, present on the metal side&#10;induces mirror charges amounting to on the dielectric side. If is highly&#10;localized about the interface, as is with SPWs, and will combine to give&#10;a net charge of . As a result, and will be reduced by a factor of . This&#10;leads to smaller and smaller . Studying dielectric effects may be&#10;important in applications.&#10;&#10;Another problem that needs to be addressed for experimental studies is&#10;concerned with the effects of inter-band transitions. In the most&#10;experimented materials, such as silver and gold, these transitions are&#10;known to have dramatic effects. They not only open a loss channel due to&#10;inter-band absorption, but also significantly shift the SPW frequency.&#10;Including them in our formalism consists of a simple generalization: in&#10;addition to and , the total current density must now also have a&#10;component accounting for inter-band transitions. The equation of motion&#10;is obtained by substituting in Eq. (\[eocc\]). One may write , where and&#10;the inter-band conductivity can in principle be calculated using&#10;Greenwood-Kubo formula. In practice, calculating could be a formidable&#10;task even for the imaginably simplest surfaces. Nevertheless, one may&#10;argue that primarily affects the properties of bulk waves, namely, . The&#10;causality principle should still protect the amplification channel. A&#10;systematic analysis will be presented elsewhere.&#10;&#10;We remark that, can also be calculated by studying the temporal&#10;evolution of the electrostatic potential energy of the system. In&#10;particular, equation (\[gamma0\]) can be directly derived in this way.&#10;Detailed calculations along this line will be published in a separate&#10;paper.&#10;&#10;To conclude, we have presented a theory for SPWs taking into account the&#10;unique interplay between ballistic electronic motions and boundary&#10;effects, from which it emerges a universal self-amplification channel&#10;for these waves. It is expected that the study will bear far-reaching&#10;practical and fundamental consequences, to be explored in the future.\&#10;\&#10;**Acknowledgement** – HYD acknowledges the International Research&#10;Fellowship of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).&#10;This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Nos. 15K13507 and 15K21722&#10;and MEXT KAKENHI Grant No. 25107005.">

We have used a tilde to indicate the transformed matrices,&#10;e.g. we write . As said, has only one non-vanishing element. Let it be&#10;the -th element. Then . See that and . Introducing and , we can rewrite&#10;the secular equation for the localized mode as Explicitly, The term in&#10;the square bracket makes only a contribution of the order of and can be&#10;neglected for large .&#10;&#10;[9]{} R.
