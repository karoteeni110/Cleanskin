    <title>Wiener-Landis criterion\
for Kolmogorov-type operators</title>
    <abstract>We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a boundary point
to be regular for the Dirichlet problem related to a class of
Kolmogorov-type equations. Our criterion is inspired by two classical
criteria for the heat equation: the Evans–Gariepy’s Wiener test, and a
criterion by Landis expressed in terms of a series of caloric
potentials. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Aim of this paper is to establish a necessary and sufficient condition&#10;for the regularity of a boundary point for the Dirichlet problem related&#10;to a class of hypoelliptic evolution equations of Kolmogorov-type. Our&#10;criterion is inspired both to the Evans–Gariepy’s Wiener test for the&#10;heat equation, and to a criterion by Landis, for the heat equation too,&#10;expressed in terms of a series of caloric potentials.&#10;&#10;The partial differential operators we are dealing with are of the&#10;following type where and are real and constant matrices, is the point of&#10;and stand for the gradient, the divergence and the inner product in ,&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;The matrix is supposed to be symmetric and positive semidefinite.&#10;Moreover, letting we assume that the following Kalman condition is&#10;satisfied: the matrix is strictly positive definite for every . As it is&#10;quite well known, the condition for is equivalent to the hypoellipticity&#10;of in , i.e to the smoothness of whenever is smooth (see, e.g., ). We&#10;also assume the operator to be homogeneous of degree two with respect to&#10;a group of dilations in . As we will recall in Section \[operatori\],&#10;this is equivalent to assume and taking the blocks form and .&#10;&#10;Under the above assumptions, one can apply results and techniques from&#10;potential theory in abstract Harmonic Spaces, as presented, e.g, in . As&#10;a consequence, for every bounded open set and for every function , the&#10;Dirichlet problem has a [GENERALIZED SOLUTION]{} in the sense of&#10;Perron–Wiener–Brelot–Bauer. The function is smooth and solves the&#10;equation in in the classical sense. However, it may occur that does not&#10;assume the boundary datum. A point is called [-REGULAR]{} for if&#10;&#10;Aim of this paper is to obtain a characterization of the -regular&#10;boundary points in terms of a serie involving -potentials of regions in&#10;, the complement of , within different level sets of , the fundamental&#10;solution of . More precisely, if and are fixed, we define for Then, our&#10;main result is the following&#10;&#10;\[iff\] Let be a bounded open subset of and let Then is -regular for if&#10;and only if&#10;&#10;Here and in what follows, if is a compact subset of , will denote the&#10;[-EQUILIBRIUM POTENTIAL]{} of , and will denote its [-CAPACITY]{}. We&#10;refer to Section \[recalls\] for the precise definitions.&#10;&#10;From Theorem \[iff\], one easily obtains a corollary resembling the&#10;Wiener test for the classical Laplace and Heat operators.&#10;&#10;\[corol\] Let be a bounded open subset of and . The following statements&#10;hold:&#10;&#10;if then is -regular;&#10;&#10;if is -regular then&#10;&#10;We can make the sufficient condition for the -regularity more concrete&#10;and more geometrical with the following corollary.&#10;&#10;\[corol2\] Let be a bounded open subset of and . If then is -regular. In&#10;particular, the -regularity of is ensured if has the exterior -cone&#10;property at .&#10;&#10;If is a subset of either or , stands for the relative Lebesgue measure.&#10;Moreover, is the homogeneous dimension recalled in Section&#10;\[operatori\], and the -cone property will be defined precisely in&#10;Section \[proofw\]. We just mention here that it is a natural adaptation&#10;of the parabolic cone condition to the homogeneities of the operator .&#10;&#10;0.4cm&#10;&#10;Before proceeding, we would like to comment on Theorem \[iff\] and&#10;Corollary \[corol\].\&#10;A boundary point regularity test for the heat equation involving&#10;infinite sum of (caloric) potentials was showed by Landis in . A similar&#10;test for a Kolmogorov equation in was obtained by Scornazzani in . Our&#10;Theorem \[iff\] contains, extends, and improves the criterion in . The&#10;Wiener test for the heat equation was proved by Evans and Gariepy in .&#10;The extension of such a criterion to the Kolmogorov operators is an&#10;open, and seemingly difficult, problem. Our Corollary \[corol\], which&#10;is a straightforward consequence of Theorem \[iff\], is a Wiener-type&#10;test giving necessary and sufficient conditions which look “almost the&#10;same”. As a matter of fact, in Theorem \[iff\] we have considered the&#10;-potentials of the compact sets which are built by the difference of two&#10;consecutive super-level sets of . These level sets correspond with the&#10;sequence of values . The exact analogue of the Evans-Gariepy criterion&#10;would have required the sequence with integer exponents . The presence&#10;of the logarithmic term, which makes the growth of the exponents&#10;slightly superlinear, is crucial for our proof of Theorem \[iff\].&#10;Moreover, such presence is also the responsible for the non-equivalence&#10;of the necessary and the sufficient condition in Corollary \[corol\]. To&#10;complete our historical comments, we mention that a potential analysis&#10;for Kolmogorov operators of the kind first appeared in , in , and in .&#10;We also mention that the cone criterion contained in Corollary&#10;\[corol2\] has been recently proved in , where such a boundary&#10;regularity test has been showed for classes of operators more general&#10;than . For further bibliographical notes concerning Wiener-type tests&#10;for both classical and DEGENERATE operators, we refer the reader to .&#10;&#10;The paper is organized as follows. In Section \[operatori\] we show some&#10;structural properties of and fix some notations. Section \[recalls\] is&#10;devoted to the potential theory for , while in Section&#10;\[crucialestimate\] a crucial estimate of the ratio between the&#10;fundamental solution at two different poles is proved. In Section&#10;\[necessity\] the [ONLY IF]{} part of Theorem \[iff\] is proved. The&#10;[IF]{} part, the core of our paper, is proved in Section \[cap\], where&#10;the estimates of Section \[crucialestimate\] play a crucial rôle.&#10;Section \[proofw\] is devoted to the proof of Corollary \[corol\] and&#10;Corollary \[corol2\].">

A point such that is called [-REGULAR]{} for .&#10;&#10;For our regularity criteria we still need a few more definitions.

<outline text="Sufficient condition for regularity" _note="In this section we prove the [IF]{} part of Theorem \[iff\].

If we take any function we have The maximum principle infers&#10;that has to be nonnegative in . On the other hand, in . Therefore in ,&#10;for every . This implies that In particular this has to be true at ,&#10;i.e. Since the function is increasing, we deduce This concludes the&#10;proof since .&#10;&#10;In order to simplify the notations, from now on we assume . This is not&#10;restrictive because of the left-invariance property. We want to choose&#10;suitably the compact sets of the previous lemma.
