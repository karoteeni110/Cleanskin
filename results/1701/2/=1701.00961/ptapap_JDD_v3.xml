    <title>The solitary g-mode frequencies in early B-type stars</title>
    <abstract>We present possible explanations of pulsations in early B-type main
sequence stars which arise purely from the excitation of gravity modes.
There are three stars with this type of oscillations detected from the
BRITE light curves: Cen, a Car, Vel. We show that by changing
metallicity or the opacity profile it is possible in some models to dump
pressure modes keeping gravity modes unstable. Other possible scenario
involves pulsations of a lower mass companion. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="For many years, it seemed that B-type main sequence (MS) pulsators can&#10;be divided into two groups: Cephei stars with low-order p/g-mode&#10;pulsations (e.g. Moskalik &amp; Dziembowski 1992, Stankov &amp; Handler 2005)&#10;and Slowly Pulsating B-type stars (SPB) with high-order g-mode&#10;pulsations (Waelkens 1991, Dziembowski, Moskalik &amp; Pamyatnykh 1993)).&#10;This simple dichotomy was spoiled by the continuous increase in accuracy&#10;of the time-series photometry obtained from multi-site campaigns and,&#10;mainly, from space missions (CoRoT, Kepler, BRITE). Thereby, many&#10;pulsators with so far unknown oscillation spectra were identified. The&#10;first example are hybrid pulsators with low order p/g modes and&#10;high-order g modes excited simultaneously. Then, even more unexpected by&#10;theoretical models oscillation spectra were obtained from the CoRoT and&#10;Kepler space data: late B-type stars with only high frequencies and&#10;early B-type stars with only low frequencies (Degroote et al. 2009,&#10;Balona et al. 2011, 2015). All these three groups pose a challenge for&#10;theoretical modelling of stellar pulsations.&#10;&#10;Recently, early B-type stars with solitary g mode frequencies were also&#10;identified from the BRITE photometry. Here, we present interpretation of&#10;this case, exemplified by the three stars observed by the BRITE&#10;satellites: Cen, a Car, Vel.&#10;&#10;In Sect.2, we give basic information about the stars. In Sect.3 we&#10;search for pulsational models of early B-type stars which can account&#10;for the observed frequencies in these three stars. Sect.3 contains other&#10;possible explanations. We end with Summary and prospects for further&#10;works.">

<outline text="The objects of interest" _note="According to the spectral classification, all three stars are main&#10;sequence objects of early B spectral type. Their basic parameters are&#10;given in Table1. The subsequent columns include: spectral type, the&#10;brightness in the Johnson passband, effective temperature and luminosity&#10;derived from the mean photometric indices and Hipparcos parallaxes, and&#10;the value of from the literature. Moreover, the last two columns contain&#10;the information about the number of frequency peaks identified in the&#10;BRITE light curves and the range of these frequencies.&#10;&#10;[(1) Hubrig et al. (2009); (2) Bernacca &amp; Perinotto (1970); (3) Leone &amp;&#10;Lanzafame (1997)]{}&#10;&#10;None of these stars is single. Cen is most probably a physical triple&#10;system (Kouwenhoven et al. 2007). Visually, the bright star, Cen A is&#10;paired with the weak component Cen B (11th magnitude) which is a dwarf&#10;of the spectral class K2. Then, Cen A is a spectroscopic binary and&#10;splits into Aa (the B2IV-type star) and Ab (probably a class A0V). The&#10;primary Aa was a candidate Cephei variable that showed line-profile&#10;variations (Schrijvers et al. 2002).&#10;&#10;The next object, a Car, is a single-lined spectroscopic binary (SB1)with&#10;the orbital period d, the radial-velocity amplitude km/s and the&#10;eccentricity of the orbit (Monet 1980). Vel is also a binary of the SB1&#10;type. The orbital period d, the radial velocity amplitude km/s and&#10;eccentricity were derived by Curtis (1907).&#10;&#10;BRITE photometry of all stars was corrected for instrumental effects&#10;which included outlier rejection and decorrelations with centroid&#10;positions and CCD temperature. Finally, offsets between individual&#10;setups were accounted for and such data were subject of the subsequent&#10;time-series analysis. The oscillation spectra of the three stars derived&#10;from the combined blue and red BRITE magnitudes are shown in Fig.1. In&#10;total, twelve, five and eight terms with amplitudes above the detection&#10;threshold were found in the photometry of Kappa Cen, a Car, and Kappa&#10;Vel, respectively. The frequency d of a Car is equal to with an accuracy&#10;better than . Thus, could be a tidally excited mode given rather high&#10;eccentricity and not very long orbital period d.">

<outline text="Pulsational models">
  <outline text="Models with standard opacities" _note="In the first step, we computed pulsational models with standard opacity&#10;data commonly used in pulsational computations, i.e., OPAL and OP. To&#10;this end, we used the Warsaw-New Jersey evolutionary code and&#10;nonadiabatic pulsational code of Dziembowski (1977).&#10;&#10;In Fig. 2, we plot the normalized instability parameter, , as a function&#10;of the mode frequency for two main sequence models with computed with&#10;the OPAL data for the initial hydrogen abundance , metallicity and the&#10;solar element mixture of Asplund et al. (2009). The positive values of&#10;are for unstable modes. The two models differ in the effective&#10;temperature and have stellar parameters suitable for Cen. The frequency&#10;peaks of Cen are marked as the vertical lines.&#10;&#10;This figure recalls the important features of gravity modes in massive&#10;main sequence models. Firstly, the instability of gravity modes&#10;increases with evolution on the main sequence and the maximum of for a&#10;given degree shifts to lower frequencies. Secondly, the instability&#10;increases with and is shifted towards the higher frequencies with . One&#10;can also see that the oscillation spectrum of Cen cannot be explained by&#10;such models because the g modes, especially with the lowest frequencies,&#10;are quite far from the instability. Moreover, the p modes, which are not&#10;observed, remain unstable.&#10;&#10;Computations with the OP opacities yield higher instability of g modes,&#10;because the metal bump is located deeper than in the OPAL opacities, but&#10;still p modes are unstable. To stabilize the p modes, we lowered&#10;metallicity to . This does not affect so much the g modes because their&#10;instability is more resistant to the metallicity reduction (e.g.,&#10;Pamyatnykh 1999). The result is shown in Fig.3, where we plot of the OP&#10;model computed with the metallicity .&#10;&#10;Similarly to Cen, a Car has a mass of about 7 but is slightly more&#10;evolved. As mentioned above, the instability of gravity modes increases&#10;with evolution on the MS. It appeared that even with the OPAL opacities&#10;it is possible to find pulsational models which can account for the&#10;observed frequency range of a Car. Fig.4 shows a comparison of the a Car&#10;oscillation spectrum with of a model computed with the OPAL opacities&#10;and metallicity . The highest frequency mode can be explained by&#10;rotational splitting.&#10;&#10; Vel is quite a problematic object as the observed parameters do not&#10;locate it on the main sequence. One would need much higher rotation, or&#10;unreliable overshooting and/or metallicty to put this star on the MS.&#10;The estimated mass of Vel is about 10 . If the star were a post-MS&#10;object then the observed oscillations could not be explained as well&#10;because pulsational modes with such low frequencies would be stable in&#10;the post-MS models in the considered range of masses.">

  <outline text="Models with modified opacities" _note="Because of the still existing uncertainties in the opacity data, we&#10;computed models with a modified profile of the mean opacity at the&#10;depths that can affect the pulsational driving of early B-type star&#10;models. Our modification consists in an artificial changing of the&#10;opacity profile at certain depths inside the star, i.e., at certain .&#10;&#10;The pulsations of B-type main sequence stars are excited by the&#10;-mechanism operating in the Z-bump around . The most important&#10;contributions to the Z-bump opacity come from Fe, Ni, Mn and Cr. The&#10;maximum opacity of these elements occurs at various depths expressed&#10;usually by , e.g., the maximum contribution of Ni to the Z-bump is at .&#10;In Figs.5 and 6, we plot the instability parameter for a model computed&#10;with the modified opacities which were reduced by 20% at and increased&#10;by 50% at .&#10;&#10;Decreasing the opacity at is needed to stabilize higher frequency modes&#10;whereas to maintain and increase the instability of low frequency modes&#10;one needs to increase the opacity at the deeper layer with temperature .">

<outline text="Other possible scenarios" _note="There is one more possible scenario. Cen is a triple system and if the&#10;Ab component, which is possibly the A0 main sequence star, has a mass of&#10;about 3.0 then the g-mode pulsations may come from this component (e.g.,&#10;Walczak et al. 2015, Szewczuk &amp; Daszynska-Daszkiewicz 2016). Similarly,&#10;in the case of a Car pulsation may originate from the companion. In the&#10;case of Vel, the pulsations of the lower mass companion seem to be the&#10;most credible explanation. This component could be invisible because: 1)&#10;it rotates very fast or 2) it is too faint. If the component is fainter&#10;by  2 mag then there is even no need for fast rotation. From the&#10;spectroscopic orbit we get a lower limit for the mass of the unseen&#10;component. Assuming the orbital inclination angle , we obtain 6.2 if the&#10;mass of the primary is and 7.0 if the mass of the primary is . Solitary&#10;g modes can be easily explained in models with masses .">

<outline text="Summary and further works" _note="We investigated models of early B-type stars in order to explain the&#10;oscillation spectra derived from the BRITE data for the three stars: Cen&#10;, a Car and Vel. All of them exhibit only low frequency peaks although,&#10;according to the spectral classification, they are in the main sequence&#10;stage, so that the p mode frequencies would be expected.&#10;&#10;Our calculations may help explaining the solitary low frequency modes in&#10;the MS stellar models we consider. The well-known facts are: 1) g modes&#10;are more unstable in more evolved models; 2) instability of g modes&#10;increases with the mode degree, , and is shifted to higher frequencies&#10;with ; 3) the instability of g-modes in the OP models is higher than in&#10;the OPAL models. The instability of g modes is more resistant to the&#10;metallicity reduction comparing to the p mode instability, and in the&#10;case of a Car this effect is sufficient to account for the oscillation&#10;frequencies. Moreover, we examined the effects of increasing the&#10;opacities in stellar models representative for the studied stars. We&#10;found that by decreasing the opacity at and increasing at it is possible&#10;to “kill” the instability of the p modes keeping the g modes unstable.&#10;The models with such modification of the mean opacity profile explain&#10;the observed frequencies of Cen. We confirmed the Salmon’s et al. (2012)&#10;result that increasing opacity at is crucial for g mode instability.&#10;&#10;Because the stars we studied are spectroscopic binaries, we cannot&#10;exclude that the pulsations come from the unseen components. In the case&#10;of Vel, the pulsations of the lower mass companion seem to be the most&#10;plausible explanation of the observed frequencies.&#10;&#10;Asplund, M., Grevesse, N., Sauval, A.
