    <title>Pruned cellular free resolutions of monomial ideals</title>
    <abstract>Using discrete Morse theory, we give an algorithm that prunes the excess
of information in the Taylor resolution and constructs a new cellular
free resolution for an arbitrary monomial ideal. The pruned resolution
is not simplicial in general, but we can slightly modify our algorithm
in order to obtain a simplicial resolution. We also show that the
Lyubeznik resolution fits into our pruning strategy. The pruned
resolution is not always minimal but it is a lot closer to the minimal
resolution than the Taylor and the Lyubeznik resolutions as we will see
in some examples. We finally use our methods to give a different
approach to the theory of splitting of monomial ideals. We deduce from
this splitting strategy that the pruned resolution is always minimal in
the case of cycles and paths. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Let be the polynomial ring over a field and a monomial ideal. The study&#10;of minimal free resolutions of these ideals has been a very active area&#10;of research during the last decades. There are topological and&#10;combinatorial formulae, as those of Hochster or Gasharov, Peeva and&#10;Welker , to describe their multigraded Betti numbers but, except for&#10;some specific classes of monomial ideals (see, e.g., , or ), the problem&#10;of describing a minimal multigraded free resolution explicitly was shown&#10;to be difficult.&#10;&#10;Another strategy is to study non-minimal free resolutions. These reveal&#10;less information than minimal free resolutions do but are often much&#10;easier to describe. The most significant ones are the Taylor resolution&#10;and the Lyubeznik resolution . An interesting feature of these two&#10;resolutions is that they fit in the theory of simplicial resolutions&#10;introduced by Bayer, Peeva and Sturmfels in and further extended to&#10;regular cellular resolutions and CW-resolutions in and respectively. The&#10;idea behind these three concepts is to associate to a free resolution of&#10;a monomial ideal a simplicial complex (respectively a regular cell&#10;complex, a CW-complex) that carries in its structure the algebraic&#10;structure of the free resolution. It is worth pointing out that Velasco&#10;proved in that there exist monomial ideals whose minimal free&#10;resolutions cannot be described by a CW-complex.&#10;&#10;By adapting the discrete Morse theory developed by Forman and Chari ,&#10;Batzies and Welker provided in a method to reduce a given regular&#10;cellular resolution. In particular, they proved that the Lyubeznik&#10;resolution can be obtained in this way from the Taylor resolution. Let’s&#10;point out that discrete Morse theory has the inconvenient that it can’t&#10;be used iteratively. To overcome this issue, one can use the algebraic&#10;discrete Morse theory developed independently by Sköldberg and&#10;Jöllenbeck and Welker . In this work, we use a similar strategy to&#10;reduce the Taylor resolution and obtain cellular and simplicial free&#10;resolutions that are closer to the minimal one than the Lyubeznik&#10;resolution. Essentially, the information given by the Taylor resolution&#10;can be encoded in a directed graph and the obstruction to its minimality&#10;can be observed in some of the edges of this graph. What we will do is&#10;to remove, in a convenient order, some of these edges to provide a&#10;smaller resolution. In some sense, we are pruning the excess of&#10;information given by the Taylor resolution in a simple and efficient&#10;way.&#10;&#10;The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section \[cellular\],&#10;we review the notion of cellular resolution and introduce the basics on&#10;discrete Morse theory that will be needed throughout this work. In&#10;Section \[prune\], we present our main results. We first provide an&#10;algorithm (Algorithm \[alg1\]) that, starting from the Taylor resolution&#10;of a monomial ideal, allows to construct a smaller cellular free&#10;resolution (Theorem \[T1\] and Corollary \[C1\]). The resolution that we&#10;obtain is not simplicial in general, but we can adapt our pruning&#10;algorithm to produce a simplicial free resolution (Algorithm \[alg3\]).&#10;Indeed, the Lyubeznik resolution fits into this pruning strategy as&#10;shown in Algorithm \[alg2\]. Other variants of our method are also&#10;mentioned.&#10;&#10;In Section \[examples\], we illustrate our results with several&#10;examples. We implemented our algorithms using CoCoALib for constructing&#10;pruned resolutions in the non-trivial examples contained in this&#10;section. Finally, in Section \[split\] we present a connection between&#10;our method and the theory of Betti splittings introduced by Eliahou and&#10;Kervaire and later developed by Francisco, Hà and Van Tuyl . We provide&#10;a sufficient condition for having a Betti splitting by checking some&#10;prunings in our algorithm. We use this approach to prove that the pruned&#10;resolution is minimal for edge ideals associated to paths and cycles.">

Let’s start recalling from the&#10;preliminaries on discrete Morse theory. Consider the directed graph on&#10;the set of cells of a regular -graded CW-complex which edges are given&#10;by For a given set of edges , denote by the graph obtained by reversing&#10;the direction of the edges in , i.e., the directed graph with edges[^1]&#10;When each cell of occurs in at most one edge of , we say that is a&#10;[MATCHING]{} on .

More precisely, we give an algorithm that produces a&#10;homogeneous acyclic matching on . Using discrete Morse theory, this will&#10;provide a cellular free resolution of .

Then, the -graded CW-complex supports a&#10;cellular free resolution of .&#10;&#10;The free resolution , like the Lyubeznik resolution, strongly depends on&#10;the order of the generators of the monomial ideal . In general, it is&#10;neither simplicial (while the Lyubeznik resolution is always simplicial)&#10;nor minimal.&#10;&#10;The proof of Theorem \[T1\] follows closely the one given in to show&#10;that the Lyubeznik resolution can be obtained using discrete Morse&#10;theory. However, we will need some reformulation of their preliminary&#10;results.&#10;&#10;Let’s start with some notations. Given , we define:&#10;&#10;Of course, implies . It follows that is the step in the algorithm where&#10;the edge containing , namely , is pruned. Note that we may have . For&#10;simplicity, we will set when no edge containing has been pruned in the&#10;algorithm.&#10;&#10;The following properties will be useful in the proof of Theorem \[T1\]:&#10;&#10;If for some s.t. , then .&#10;&#10;The result obviously holds if . When , the result follows from the fact&#10;that implies .&#10;&#10;If and for some s.t. , then .&#10;&#10;We have so it follows that and therefore . On the other hand, we also&#10;have the equality so and the reverse inequality follows.&#10;&#10;If , then .&#10;&#10;Assume that . Then we have by definition. To prove the reverse&#10;inequality we only have to notice that and equivalently . Using similar&#10;arguments we also obtain when .&#10;&#10;[OF THEOREM \[T1\].]{} It is clear from its construction that the set is&#10;a matching since we are removing edges (or pairs of cells) at each step&#10;of the algorithm. To check that it is acyclic, assume that we have a&#10;cycle Then , and hence equality must hold everywhere. Let’s see that we&#10;also have .&#10;&#10;We start considering the case of a reversed arrow , where . We have by&#10;iii) so, by ii), we also have .&#10;&#10;For a direct arrow we have for some . We have were the first inequality&#10;is due to the fact that the vertex must be pruned in the next link of&#10;the chain. The second inequality comes from i) and it can not be strict&#10;because of the definition of . Therefore and we have by ii), that is, .&#10;&#10;Since all the elements in the cycle have the same , we deduce that such&#10;cycle cannot exist due to the fact that we can only go in the direction&#10;of when constructing the edges of the cycle. At the end, we would have&#10;an edge with both directions and we get a contradiction.&#10;&#10;This shows that is an acyclic matching on , and it is homogeneous by&#10;construction of in our pruning algorithm.&#10;&#10;A nice feature about the pruning algorithm is that we do not need to&#10;care if the original system of generators of the monomial ideal is&#10;minimal or not. Roughly speaking, the pruning algorithm will always&#10;remove the excess of information given by the extra generators.&#10;&#10;\[minimal\] Let be a monomial ideal, and let be its minimal set of&#10;generators with . Let and be the Taylor simplicial complexes associated&#10;to these two sets of generators[^2] and , be the sets of pruned edges&#10;obtained by applying Algorithm \[alg1\] to each case.

  <outline text="First examples" _note="Already for some simple examples we can appreciate the better behavior&#10;of the pruned resolutions with respect to the Lyubeznik resolution.&#10;&#10;\[ex5path5cycle\] We are going to describe the steps of the pruning&#10;Algorithms described in Section \[prune\] for the edge ideals associated&#10;to a -path and a -cycle:&#10;&#10; Let be the edge ideal of a -path.

The simplicial pruned resolution is&#10;not minimal but it is as small as possible since the ideal has no&#10;minimal simplicial resolution as one can check using an argument similar&#10;to the one used in for the 4-cycle.

The edges pruned at Step (3) and (4) are also&#10;pruned in Algorithm \[alg3\]. The edge pruned at Step (5) is not pruned&#10;in Algorithm \[alg3\]. Notice that the two edges that prohibited the&#10;pruning at Step (3) of Algorithm \[alg3\] were pruned at Step (4). This&#10;means that we can perform another round of Algorithm \[alg3\] that will&#10;prune the two edges that could not be pruned before at step (2) as&#10;observed in Remark \[rkIterate\].&#10;&#10;On the other hand, note that after the first step, no more edge can be&#10;pruned through Algorithm \[alg2\].

Finally, let’s point out that&#10;Torrente and Varbaro provided a fast algorithm for computing Betti&#10;diagrams of a monomial ideal taking as a starting point the Lyubeznik&#10;resolution of the ideal. Using the pruned resolution as starting point&#10;of their algorithm would speed up their computation of the Betti&#10;diagram.">

  <outline text="A sufficient condition for Betti splittings" _note="Let be a decomposition of a monomial ideal. In order to have a Betti&#10;splitting, it is enough to check that applying Algorithm \[alg1\] to ,&#10;the pruning steps are realized independently within the edges associated&#10;to , and . This gives the following result that provides a sufficient&#10;condition to have a Betti splitting:&#10;&#10;Let be a monomial ideal and consider the ideals and . If we only perform&#10;pruning steps within the edges of , or separatedly in Algorithm&#10;\[alg1\], then is a pruned Betti splitting for .&#10;&#10;In the particular case that we remove just one generator from our&#10;initial ideal, we obtain the following:&#10;&#10;Let be a monomial ideal and consider the ideals and . If no pruning has&#10;been made at the step of Algorithm \[alg1\], then is a pruned Betti&#10;splitting for .&#10;&#10;Betti splitting techniques can be used to provide a recursive method to&#10;compute Betti numbers of monomial ideals. For example, the case of edge&#10;ideals of graphs has been successfully studied in and where they&#10;considered [SPLITTING EDGES]{} and [SPLITTING VERTICES]{}. Splitting&#10;edges are easy to describe (see ) but, in general they are difficult to&#10;find. On the other hand, every vertex is a splitting vertex except for&#10;some limit cases where the vertex is isolated or its complement consists&#10;of isolated vertices.&#10;&#10;One can also check that any vertex also provides a pruned Betti&#10;splitting. Indeed, let be the edge ideal of a graph on vertices.&#10;Consider a vertex, say , and the decomposition where is the edge ideal&#10;of the graph obtained from by removing the vertex and all the edges&#10;passing through this vertex. Notice that is the edge ideal of a&#10;bipartite graph where is the number of vertices adjacent to in . We have&#10;a pruned Betti splitting because the ideal does not involve the variable&#10;and the pruning steps of the algorithm are performed within and&#10;separately. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that the pruning&#10;algorithm provides a minimal free resolution for , and hence In&#10;particular, if Algorithm \[alg1\] provides a minimal free resolution for&#10;and , then it is also provides a minimal free resolution for .&#10;&#10;For paths and cycles, we can use these splitting techniques to prove&#10;that the pruning algorithm will always provide a minimal free resolution&#10;as we already observed in Example \[ex5path5cycle\] for the -path and&#10;the -cycle. The Betti numbers of these ideals have already been computed&#10;by Jacques in .&#10;&#10;\[ex\_npath\] Let be the edge ideal of an -path. A decomposition with&#10;and is a pruned Betti splitting simply because the ideal does not&#10;involve the vertex . Therefore we have Indeed, this is a Betti splitting&#10;and the pruning algorithm provides a minimal free resolution, thus By&#10;induction, we get a minimal free resolution for the ideals and so we&#10;only have to control the intersection in order to get the desired&#10;result. Recall that, using Lemma \[minimal\], we only have to consider a&#10;minimal set of generators. In our case we have If we consider the&#10;decomposition , we have a Betti splitting. Namely, the pruning algorithm&#10;applied on the ideals and is equivalent to the one given for the path ,&#10;and we are done by induction.&#10;&#10;Let be the edge ideal of an -cycle. The decomposition with and is not a&#10;Betti splitting by . Indeed, there is a pruning in the last step of&#10;Algorithm \[alg1\].&#10;&#10;It is more convenient to consider a splitting vertex . Namely, consider&#10;with and . Since and are the ideal of an -path and a -path respectively,&#10;the pruning algorithm provides a minimal free resolution as shown in&#10;Example \[ex\_npath\]. Therefore we have:&#10;&#10;A minimal set of generators of is We have a pruned Betti splitting given&#10;by . The pruning algorithm gives a minimal free resolution for the&#10;ideals and as we have seen when dealing with the case of paths. A&#10;minimal set of generators for the intersection is but the pruning&#10;algorithm applied to this ideal is equivalent to the one for the cycle ,&#10;and we are done by induction.&#10;&#10;[23]{}&#10;&#10;J. Abbot and A.
