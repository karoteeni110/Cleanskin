    <title>Burst and inter-burst duration statistics as empirical test of
long-range memory in the financial markets</title>
    <abstract>We address the problem of long-range memory in the financial markets.
There are two conceptually different ways to reproduce power-law decay
of auto-correlation function: using fractional Brownian motion as well
as non-linear stochastic differential equations. In this contribution we
address this problem by analyzing empirical return and trading activity
time series from the Forex. From the empirical time series we obtain
probability density functions of burst and inter-burst duration. Our
analysis reveals that the power-law exponents of the obtained
probability density functions are close to , which is a characteristic
feature of the one-dimensional stochastic processes. This is in a good
agreement with earlier proposed model of absolute return based on the
non-linear stochastic differential equations derived from the
agent-based herding model. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The long-range memory in volatility and trading activity of the&#10;financial markets is still one of the most mysterious features&#10;attracting permanent attention of researchers as some ambiguity is still&#10;present. There are numerous works, which construct autoregressive models&#10;with embedded long-range memory – such as FIGARCH, LM-ARCH, FIEGARCH .&#10;The slowly decaying auto-correlation for volatility and trading&#10;activity, is a characteristic property of the empirical financial time&#10;series . This empirical property might originate from the true&#10;long-range memory process with correlated increments such as the&#10;fractional Brownian motion (fBm) or from the Markov processes with&#10;slowly decaying auto-correlation such as stochastic processes with&#10;non-stationary uncorrelated increments . The debate whether this slow&#10;decay corresponds to long-range memory is still ongoing, econometricians&#10;tend to conclude that the statistical analysis in general cannot be&#10;expected to provide a definite answer concerning the presence or absence&#10;of long-range memory in asset price return .&#10;&#10;Recently we have proposed an agent-based model, macroscopic dynamics of&#10;which can be reduced to Fokker-Planck equation or a set of stochastic&#10;differential equations (SDEs), which is able to precisely reproduce&#10;empirical probability density function (PDF) and power spectral density&#10;(PSD) of absolute return as well as scaling behavior of volatility&#10;return intervals . Similar non-linearity can be introduced into&#10;GARCH(1,1) process to recover noise as well. This raises a question if&#10;the long-range memory present in the financial markets should be&#10;embedded into the models or empirically observed property is just an&#10;outcome of non-linear agent interactions.&#10;&#10;From our point of view there is a fundamental problem to empirically&#10;establish which of the possible alternatives, fBm or stochastic&#10;processes with non-stationary increments, is most well-suited to&#10;describe financial markets. The main idea is to employ the dependence of&#10;first passage time PDF on Hurst parameter for the fBm . This is in close&#10;connection with research of volatility return intervals and of first&#10;passage times in non-linear stochastic processes .&#10;&#10;In Section \[sec:hurst-first-passage\] we present the short theoretical&#10;background for our empirical investigation, in Section \[sec:empirical\]&#10;we deal with empirical data from Forex and in Section \[sec:conclusion\]&#10;we discuss and conclude results.">

<outline text="Hurst parameter and first passage times of stochastic processes" _note="We will consider the first passage problem of stochastic processes with&#10;absorbing boundary at some threshold level . The problem for fBm was&#10;first considered by Ding and Yang as first return time .&#10;&#10;We consider two distinct threshold passage events – one describes return&#10;to the threshold from above, while the other describes return to the&#10;threshold from below. Burst duration is the amount of time time series&#10;spent above the threshold (starts with passage from below and ends with&#10;passage from above; in [Fig. \[fig1\]]{}). While the inter-burst&#10;duration is the amount of time series spent below the threshold (starts&#10;with passage from above and ends with passage from below; in&#10;[Fig. \[fig1\]]{}). The PDFs of burst and inter-burst duration for fBm&#10;coincide and can be written as Here is the Hurst parameter defining the&#10;exponent of power-law PDF , which coincides with the corresponding&#10;exponent for other one-dimensional Markov processes only when . Burst&#10;and inter-burst duration can be defined through the first passage&#10;problem with initial value infinitesimally near the threshold .&#10;&#10;It is widely accepted that the deviation of Hurst parameter from&#10;indicates about long-range memory in data, but this is not true as class&#10;of Markov processes with non-stationary increments can generate signals&#10;with and slowly decaying auto-correlation . We have earlier proposed to&#10;model financial markets by non-linear SDE, , which belongs to this class&#10;as well. Many other agent-based models with non-linear interactions can&#10;lead to the macroscopic description by a non-linear SDEs of the&#10;following or a similar form having just two parameters: as exponent of&#10;noise multiplicativity and as exponent of power-law PDF. It was&#10;justified by various methods that this class of SDE generates the time&#10;series with the power-law behavior of stationary PDF and PSD , It is&#10;noteworthy that these interconnected power-law properties are the direct&#10;outcome of scaling property in Fokker-Planck equation for two point&#10;transition probability corresponding to the SDE (\[eq:SDE2\]) The class&#10;of SDEs (\[eq:SDE2\]) describes multifractal stochastic processes with&#10;non-stationary increments and despite it’s power-law auto-correlation&#10;and PSD (\[eq:power-law\]) does not imply dynamics with correlated&#10;signals like those of fBm. Here we will look for the opportunity to&#10;establish test for the empirical data helping to make clear distinction&#10;between these two different models with correlated and uncorrelated&#10;increments.&#10;&#10;The initial idea of such test comes from the PDF of first return times&#10;(\[eq:TPDF\]) depending on in the case of fBm and corresponding PDF for&#10;non-linear SDEs (\[eq:SDE2\]) characterized by power-law exponent common&#10;for all one-dimensional Markov processes . The burst duration for the&#10;non-linear SDEs (\[eq:SDE2\]) were considered in . The asymptotic&#10;behavior of time PDF can be written in rather transparent form Here, ,&#10;and is a first zero of a Bessel function of the first kind. The&#10;power-law behavior with exponent in Eq. (\[eq:burst\]) is consistent&#10;with the general theory of the first passage times in one-dimensional&#10;stochastic processes .">

<outline text="Empirical investigation of burst and inter-burst duration" _note="Empirical evaluation of PDF for burst and inter-burst duration should&#10;serve as a test for the nature of stochastic process. Deviations from&#10;the power-law with exponent in the case of fBm signals about true&#10;long-range dependence. Certainly, we will see later, such test is not so&#10;straightforward as real processes such as volatility in the financial&#10;markets may be more complicated than one-dimensional stochastic&#10;processes.&#10;&#10;We investigate burst and inter-burst duration for two financial&#10;variables: trading activity – number of market trades during selected&#10;time window and volatility defined as filtered logarithmic return in the&#10;same time window. Following the idea of earlier proposed modeling, where&#10;trades arrive as in quasi-Poisson process driven by non-linear SDE , we&#10;will try to extract statistical properties of driving stochastic process&#10;from high frequency trading series in Forex.&#10;&#10;First we investigate properties of trading activity recovered from the&#10;high frequency empirical data of EUR/USD exchange. These trading series&#10;have information about time of transactions executed. Time series are&#10;joint into the continuous time sequence recorded in the period of 10&#10;years from January, 2000 to October, 2010, thus we are able to recover&#10;quasi-Poisson sequence of inter-trade duration’s . According model&#10;assumption these series are driven by continuous stochastic process and&#10;the conditional probability of the inter-event time is defined by the&#10;stochastic rate One can define trading activity here as , which exhibits&#10;long-range dependence, see . To recover from empirical data we use&#10;Anscombe transform introduced to process image information , when signal&#10;intensity is low and Poisson fluctuations are considerable. We evaluate&#10;the number of trades in the subsequent intervals of 60 seconds , apply&#10;procedure of moving average with time window after first Anscombe&#10;transform, then revert back with exact unbiased reverse Anscombe&#10;transform . The recovered stochastic empirical signal is an object of&#10;our empirical investigation. It is easy to demonstrate that the PSD of&#10;this signal exhibits long-range dependence with , see&#10;[Fig. \[fig2\]]{}(c).&#10;&#10;The interpretation of this result is not trivial as and . The recovered&#10;signal behaves as fBm and fractional Gaussian noise at the same time.&#10;Any additional statistical property of the signal might shed some light&#10;on the problem. Pure fBm process should yield the PDF of and according&#10;Eq. (\[eq:TPDF\]). The value of Hurst parameter and the exponent of&#10;burst and inter-burst duration distribution should be expected if fBm&#10;was assumed as the model of long-range dependence.&#10;&#10;In [Fig. \[fig3\]]{} we demonstrate numerical results of and PDFs for&#10;empirical EUR/USD exchange trading activity .&#10;&#10;The comprehensive interpretation of this result is a challenge, because&#10;empirical signal is very sophisticated. Even if we have succeeded to&#10;overcome the problem of the exogenous noise, Poisson fluctuations here,&#10;the signal probably incorporates at least double stochastic dynamics of&#10;agents and intraday seasonality, see . Nevertheless, from our point of&#10;view, the main long-range dependence in the financial markets, the part&#10;of PSD for the lowest frequencies, has to be recoverable from other more&#10;frequent fluctuations. Indeed, the PDF of burst duration ,&#10;[Fig. \[fig3\]]{}(a), exhibits power-law behavior in the region of two&#10;orders wide with exponent . This is apparent only for low values of&#10;threshold , , , where bursts are wide and contribution of other noises&#10;is less considerable. For higher thresholds , , , where inter-burst&#10;duration are bigger, the main power-law of appears valid for up to three&#10;orders of magnitude of values, see [Fig. \[fig3\]]{}(b). Thus we are&#10;able to recover the fundamental law of in the wide region of thresholds&#10;from 0.3 to 2.5. This law is a characteristic feature of one-dimensional&#10;Markov processes and observed result might signal that such process lies&#10;in the background of quasi-Poisson fluctuations for inter-trade duration&#10;Eq.(\[eq:Poisson\]), . Note that this long-range dynamics might have the&#10;same roots as dynamics of absolute return, see for more details.&#10;&#10;Dealing with volatility defined as filtered return we start from the&#10;very general modeling of return time series by where is an asset price,&#10;is a Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance, as in the family&#10;of ARCH models of return series. In the agent-based modeling Eq.&#10;(\[eq:return\]) assumes interplay of exogenous noise with endogenous&#10;volatility in very short time intervals of one minute order. When we are&#10;interested in the longer time scales , . The volatility in this modeling&#10;is a linear function of the absolute endogenous log price derived as&#10;double stochastic Markov process from the Master equation of population&#10;dynamics for heterogeneous agents Here normalizes standard deviation of&#10;time series to the unit; is an empirical parameter which measures impact&#10;of endogenous dynamics on the observed time series. The model, defined&#10;by Eqs. (\[eq:return\]) and (\[eq:defvolatil\]), comprises both the&#10;agent-based dynamic part described by and the exogenous noise part&#10;described by . We will try to extract statistical properties of&#10;endogenous dynamics from return time series in Forex.&#10;&#10;Let us now consider empirical time series of EUR/USD return with .&#10;Having in mind quite general assumption about exogenous noise Eq.&#10;(\[eq:return\]), we filter it by standard deviation filter with time&#10;window of 10 min. Statistical properties of these time series are given&#10;in [Fig. \[fig4\]]{}.&#10;&#10;The main statistical properties for return series are slightly different&#10;from trading activity, for example, values of exponents for PSD are and&#10;. The value of Hurst parameter thus the exponent of corresponding burst&#10;and inter-burst duration distribution should be expected. This implies a&#10;meaningful deviation from law, which has to be observable in the PDFs of&#10;burst and inter-burst duration.&#10;&#10;In [Fig. \[fig5\]]{}(a) the PDF of burst duration , exhibits power-law&#10;behavior in the region of two orders wide for low values of threshold ,&#10;, . The cut of of power-law starts earlier for higher values of the&#10;threshold. For higher thresholds , , , see [Fig. \[fig5\]]{}(b), where&#10;inter-burst duration are bigger, the main power-law of appears valid&#10;without any intention to approach exponent , which would be more&#10;appropriate for fBm process. Thus we are able to recover the fundamental&#10;law of in the wide region of thresholds for return series as well. This&#10;implies that supposed long-range dependence of return series probably is&#10;driven by one-dimensional Markov process, derived in the model of&#10;finance with heterogeneous agents .&#10;&#10;The procedures of signal filtering in two previous examples of financial&#10;time series helped us to diminish the influence of exogenous noise . In&#10;the case of longer time scales of return definition , when , the&#10;exogenous noise becomes integrated into . It is an open question how the&#10;exogenous noise impacts PDFs of burst and inter-burst duration for the&#10;calculated with standard deviation filter applied to the empirical&#10;series . We analyze the daily return series for CHF/USD, DKK/USD,&#10;JPY/USD, NOK/USD, USD/GBP exchanges in the period of years and apply&#10;standard deviation filter with time window trading days. In&#10;[Fig. \[fig6\]]{} we present the main statistical properties of NOK/USD&#10;daily return series.&#10;&#10;The main peculiarity of daily series is the PSD with only one power-law&#10;exponent , see [Fig. \[fig6\]]{}(c). The value of lower than 1 is a&#10;consequence of exogenous and other frequent fluctuations integrated into&#10;the daily return. However, PDFs of burst and inter-burst duration&#10;defined for these series can be easily calculated as well. We&#10;demonstrate these PDFs calculated as and histograms in&#10;[Fig. \[fig7\]]{}. Though the amount of data is limited and histograms&#10;are noise, PDFs are consistent with power-law.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Discussion and Conclusions" _note="The fluctuations of volatility and trading activity in the financial&#10;markets are known to exhibit noise or slowly decaying auto-correlation .&#10;It becomes evident that the explanation of this statistical property is&#10;related with the model assumption of the financial system. The most&#10;frequent exogenous fluctuations can be filtered from empirical data in&#10;order to reveal peculiarities of expected long-range behavior . Time&#10;series of volatility and trading activity, from our point of view, is a&#10;result of heterogeneous agent dynamics, which in macroscopic level can&#10;be described by Fokker-Plank equation or a set of SDEs . Ordinary SDEs&#10;driven by Wienner noise describe Markov processes and usually are not&#10;treated as suitable to model long-range memory. Stochastic processes&#10;driven by fBm could be considered as possible alternative. Thus the&#10;choice between these two possibilities is the fundamental question for&#10;understanding and modeling of the financial markets.&#10;&#10;Here we proposed a possible test for these alternatives investigating&#10;burst and inter-burst duration of empirical time series. For fBm process&#10;it is well known that PDF of first passage time is dependent on , . On&#10;the other hand for Markov processes it is well known that first passage&#10;time should scale as . Though the dynamics of heterogeneous agents might&#10;result in multivariate statistics, when we need more than two groups of&#10;different agents, sometimes it is possible to segregate stochastic&#10;processes by time scale, when frequencies of fluctuations in various&#10;agent groups are considerably different. From our point of view this is&#10;the case in the financial markets and PSD with few values of can be&#10;modeled with such assumption .&#10;&#10;Instead of details in agent-based modeling, here we just wanted to&#10;establish whether macroscopic modeling by non-linear SDEs can be&#10;reasonable. The main result of empirical investigation of PDF for burst&#10;and inter-burst duration suggests that power-law part is consistent with&#10;the exponent , which is characteristic feature of one-dimensional&#10;stochastic processes generated by ordinary SDE including non-linear .&#10;&#10;The result is confirmed for minute EUR/USD return and trading activity&#10;series and for CHF/USD, DKK/USD, JPY/USD, NOK/USD, USD/GBP daily return&#10;series. This is in agreement with previous research of volatility return&#10;intervals .&#10;&#10;Though there is no independent agent-based model for trading activity,&#10;our result confirms that such models should be consistent with&#10;description by non-linear SDEs as well. Also it confirms that PDFs of&#10;burst and inter-burst duration are in agreement with power-law relation&#10;of trading activity and absolute return assumed in the modeling of the&#10;financial markets .&#10;&#10;The most general conclusion of this empirical investigation is an&#10;opportunity to explain the so-called long-range memory in the financial&#10;markets by ordinary non-linear SDEs, Eq. (\[eq:SDE2\]), representing&#10;multifractal stochastic processes with non-stationary increments. This&#10;is a very realistic alternative to the modeling incorporating fBm.&#10;Further empirical analyses of burst and inter-burst duration for various&#10;markets and assets should considerably strengthen and extend these&#10;conclusions.&#10;&#10;[10]{}&#10;&#10;R. Engle and A. Patton, “What good is a volatility model?,”&#10;[QUANTITATIVE FINANCE]{}, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 237–245, 2001.&#10;&#10;V. Plerou, P. Gopikrishnan, X. Gabaix, L. Amaral, and H. Stanley, “Price&#10;fluctuations, market activity and trading volume,” [QUANTITATIVE&#10;FINANCE]{}, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 262–269, 2001.&#10;&#10;X. Gabaix, P. Gopikrishnan, V. Plerou, and H. E.
