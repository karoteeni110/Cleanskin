  <outline text="Properties of Generated Network" _note="\[tab:gp\]&#10;&#10;\[tab:interact\]&#10;&#10;In the first experiment, we show the properties of networks generated&#10;with different settings. We generated for each setting networks with&#10;approximately nodes. Table \[tab:gp\] summarizes average values (and&#10;standard deviation) of measured properties for each setting. Measured&#10;properties include number of nodes and edges , average degree k, average&#10;shortest path length l, diameter , average clustering coefficient ,&#10;assortativity , number of communities detected by Infomap and Louvain&#10;algorithm, and corresponding modularities and , respectively. Table&#10;\[tab:interact\] contains average values associated with the temporality&#10;of the network, i.e. total number of interactions , average number of&#10;interactions i and average number of nodes in interaction s. Figures&#10;\[fig:DD\]-\[fig:ComSize\] show degree distribution, number of&#10;interactions distribution and distributions of community size detected&#10;by Infomap algorithm.&#10;&#10;The experiment indicates that all three settings generate networks with&#10;small-world and scale-free characteristics. The first and second setting&#10;have generated networks of high average clustering coefficient. Networks&#10;have a tendency to be assortative. Assortativity values correspond to&#10;all settings to the values known from social networks . Generated&#10;networks also have community structure and a high modularity for all&#10;settings.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:Set1000\] shows a network with nodes and edges generated&#10;with . A total of interactions took place. The size of nodes and&#10;strength of edges correspond to the number of interactions they took&#10;part in, the labels indicate the order in which nodes were created. The&#10;network has an overlapping community and core-periphery structure.&#10;Colored 19 communities were detected by Louvain method, modularity is .">

  <outline text="Evolution of Generated Network" _note="The subject of the second experiment is one network generated with . The&#10;aim is to show the development of network properties during its growth.&#10;The values for each characteristic are measured when the network has ,&#10;..., and nodes. The results are summarized in Table \[tab:Evolut\].&#10;&#10;\[tab:Evolut\]&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:EvolNet\], similarly to the previous experiment, shows the&#10;distribution of degree, number of interactions and size of communities.&#10;The evolution of these properties is portrayed when network has nodes.&#10;&#10;Key properties (average degree, shortest path, clustering coefficient,&#10;assortativity, modularity) happen to stabilize their values between and&#10;nodes. Our experiments show that generated networks with other settings&#10;also have similar behavior. Figure \[fig:InterEvol\] shows the evolution&#10;of the number of interactions for fifteen nodes with the highest number&#10;of interactions at the end of the generation process. The ID of a node&#10;represents the moment of its creation. The trend shows how the chances&#10;of participating in interactions increase for nodes that already have a&#10;high number of interactions.">

  <outline text="Correlations" _note="In this experiment, we compare the analyzed real-world network with&#10;generated networks. For each setting we generated a network with one&#10;million nodes. Then we examined the correlation between the node’s&#10;creation time and it’s degree and number of interactions, respectively.&#10;The emergence of the node is represented by its , which is in the order&#10;of its creation. Furthermore, we calculated the correlation between&#10;degree and number of node’s interactions. We did the same for the&#10;analyzed DBLP dataset, where the order of nodes is to be understood as&#10;an estimate based on data pre-processing described in Section&#10;\[sec:dblp\].&#10;&#10;\[tab:corr\]&#10;&#10;The results summarized in Table \[tab:corr\] show that regardless of the&#10;setting, the first two correlations are much higher in the 3-lambda&#10;model than in the DBLP dataset (Pearson’s correlation coefficient was&#10;used). Thus, in the presented model, older nodes have a higher (and&#10;continuous) chance to participate in interactions than in reality. The&#10;cause is probably the aging of nodes in real-world networks where nodes,&#10;at different times, no longer participate in interactions. This&#10;significantly affects the evolution (growth) and some properties of the&#10;network.&#10;&#10;Previous experiments demonstrated that despite the absence of aging,&#10;generated networks have very good properties. We have not, therefore,&#10;for reasons of simplicity, incorporated any of the known models of aging&#10;(e.g. inspired by ) to the 3-lambda network model.">
