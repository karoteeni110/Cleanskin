    <title>Polaron-Polaritons in the Integer and Fractional Quantum Hall Regimes</title>
    <abstract>Elementary quasi-particles in a two dimensional electron system can be
described as exciton-polarons since electron-exciton interactions
ensures dressing of excitons by Fermi-sea electron-hole pair
excitations. A relevant open question is the modification of this
description when the electrons occupy flat-bands and electron-electron
interactions become prominent. Here, we perform cavity spectroscopy of a
two dimensional electron system in the strong-coupling regime where
polariton resonances carry signatures of strongly correlated quantum
Hall phases. By measuring the evolution of the polariton splitting under
an external magnetic field, we demonstrate the modification of
electron-exciton interactions that we associate with phase space filling
at integer filling factors and polaron dressing at fractional filling
factors. The observed non-linear behavior shows great promise for
enhancing polariton-polariton interactions. </abstract>
