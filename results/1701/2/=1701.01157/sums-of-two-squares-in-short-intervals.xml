    <title>Poisson distribution for gaps between sums of two squares and level
spacings for toral point scatterers</title>
    <abstract>We investigate the level spacing distribution for the quantum spectrum
of the square billiard. Extending work of Connors–Keating, and
Smilansky, we formulate an analog of the Hardy–Littlewood prime -tuple
conjecture for sums of two squares, and show that it implies that the
spectral gaps, after removing degeneracies and rescaling, are Poisson
distributed. Consequently, by work of Rudnick and Ueberschär, the level
spacings of arithmetic toral point scatterers, in the weak coupling
limit, are also Poisson distributed. We also give numerical evidence for
the conjecture and its implications. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="According to the Berry–Tabor conjecture , the energy levels for generic&#10;integrable systems should be Poisson distributed in the semiclassical&#10;limit. As noted by Connors and Keating , the square billiard, though&#10;integrable, is not generic: due to spectral degeneracies, the level&#10;spacing distribution tends to a -function at zero. However, if we remove&#10;the degeneracies and rescale so that the mean spacing is unity, numerics&#10;indicate Poisson spacings.&#10;&#10;The energy levels of the square billiard, say with side length , are&#10;number theoretical in nature, and given by for . After removing&#10;degeneracies and rescaling, we are led to study the nearest neighbor&#10;spacing distribution&#10;&#10;(as ), where denotes the th smallest element of the set (In our setting&#10;the leading order of the density of states is asymptotically equal to as&#10;\[cf.  \], and hence the spacing distribution of the unfolded levels has&#10;the same asymptotic distribution as the gaps in .)&#10;&#10;This is the probability that, given , there is some integer such that&#10;where is the indicator function of .&#10;&#10;If the positions of the levels , , were uncorrelated, this probability&#10;would be which, viewed as a Riemann sum approximation to the integral ,&#10;would suggest that the nearest neighbor spacing distribution does indeed&#10;follow a Poisson law, i.e. that&#10;&#10;If the positions of the levels , , were uncorrelated, this would indeed&#10;follow a Poisson law.&#10;&#10;However, being sums of two squares, the levels are not uncorrelated.&#10;&#10;For instance, four consecutive integers cannot all be in , since one of&#10;them is congruent to modulo .&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, taking into account correlations modulo all prime powers,&#10;we still (conjecturally) expect to follow a Poisson law, consistent with&#10;numerics.&#10;&#10;Rather than studying the spacing distribution directly, we shall proceed&#10;by investigating [UNORDERED]{} -tuples of elements in . Thus, given and&#10;with , consider the correlation function where denotes the indicator&#10;function of . If , this is the level density By a classical result of&#10;Landau , where is an explicitly given constant (see ). To formulate an&#10;analog of (\[eq:sotsnt\]) for we need some further notation. Given a&#10;prime , define (That the limit exists is shown in Section&#10;\[sec:prelims\], cf.  Propositions \[prop:Sp3h\] and \[prop:S2h\].)&#10;Further, for and a set with , we define the [SINGULAR SERIES]{} for by&#10;with and as in .

Moreover, the distribution of the number of points in&#10;intervals of size comparable to the mean spacing is consistent with that&#10;of a Poisson process. (We remark that our hypothesis can be weakened&#10;slightly — see Section \[sec:main\].)&#10;&#10;\[thm:main\] Let and be real parameters tending to infinity in such a&#10;way that .

<outline text="Discussion" _note="Connors and Keating determined the singular series for shifted pairs of&#10;sums of two squares and gave a probabilistic derivation of Conjecture&#10;\[con:sotsktups\] for , and found that it matched numerics quite well&#10;(to within ). Smilansky then expressed the singular series for pairs as&#10;products of -adic densities, and showed that its mean value (over short&#10;intervals of shifts) is consistent with a Poisson distribution, and that&#10;the same is true for sums of two squares, on assuming a uniform version&#10;of Conjecture \[con:sotsktups\] for . He also determined the singular&#10;series for triples corresponding to the shifts . As already mentioned,&#10;the analog of Theorem \[thm:main\] (b) for primes is due to Gallagher;&#10;in he showed that an appropriate form of the Hardy–Littlewood prime&#10;-tuples conjecture implies the prime analog of . (That it implies the&#10;prime analog of is mentioned in Hooley’s survey article .) To show that&#10;the singular series is one on average (i.e., the prime analog of&#10;Proposition \[prop:sssa\]), Gallagher uses combinatorial identities for&#10;Stirling numbers of the second kind. In , Kowalski developed an elegant&#10;probabilistic framework for evaluating averages of singular series.&#10;Rather than using combinatorial identities, he showed that a certain&#10;duality between -th moments of -tuples and -th moments of -tuples holds&#10;(cf. ). That the -th moment of -tuples equals one is essentially&#10;trivial; by duality he obtains the non-trivial consequence that first&#10;moments of -tuples also equals one. (Note that can be viewed as a first&#10;moment of -tuples when .)&#10;&#10;Our approach originates with techniques developed in , and further&#10;refined in . Loosely speaking, the singular series is expanded into&#10;local factors of the form , and thus where and . Hence and the main term&#10;is given by . For large, can be shown to be small on average. For small,&#10;we use that (approximately) only depends on , together with complete&#10;cancellation when summing over the [FULL]{} set of residues modulo ,&#10;i.e., . This follows, via the Chinese remainder theorem, from local&#10;cancellations , which in turn can be deduced from the following easily&#10;verifiable identity: given [ANY]{} subset , we have (cf. Lemma&#10;\[lem:cancel\] (b) and its proof for more details):&#10;&#10;However, unlike the setup in , where the local error terms are&#10;determined by , in the current setting the image of , for any fixed , is&#10;not sufficient to determine . On the other hand, the function has nice&#10;-adic regularity properties, allowing us to approximate by truncations&#10;such that only depends on , and for all . Apart from making the&#10;arguments more complicated, we also get a weaker error term: if only&#10;depended on , we would get a relative error of size , rather than . We&#10;also note that David, Koukoulopoulos and Smith , in studying statistics&#10;of elliptic curves, have developed quite general methods for finding&#10;asymptotics of weighted sums , provided that the local factors have&#10;-adic regularity properties similar to the ones above. In fact,&#10;Proposition \[prop:sssa\], though with a weaker error term, can be&#10;deduced from .&#10;&#10;We finally remark that the corresponding question in the function field&#10;setting is better understood — Bary–Soroker and Fehm recently showed&#10;that the sums of squares analog of the -tuple conjecture holds in the&#10;large -limit for the function field setting (e.g., replacing by and by&#10;).">

To this end,&#10;let us introduce some notation and establish some basic inequalities.&#10;Let a nonempty, finite set be given, and let .

Define and as the numbers&#10;given by the relations Note that by Proposition \[prop:Sp3h\], and part&#10;(c), and , with if . Also, (because ). Since , we have In the special&#10;case we can take . We therefore have &#10;&#10;Writing , we have If then , and if then, as already noted, , i.e. , so&#10;in any case. Since, as already noted, , we have . Thus, For , the&#10;left-hand side is equal to (see ), so this gives .&#10;&#10;\(c) Consider (the case is similar). Let . By (a) and (b), the result&#10;holds for and even, so we may assume that is odd. In that case, using in&#10;the definition of , we see that since, for any , and . We deduce, from&#10;and , that , which is in the case .&#10;&#10;Now consider the case . Note that, by Proposition \[prop:Sp3h\], and&#10;part (c), we have, for any , In view of this and (the special case) , we&#10;have, for odd , Since , we have similarly, Combining gives , i.e. , for&#10;odd .&#10;&#10;\(d) Consider (the case is similar). Let . We have because for even (by&#10;(a)), and the middle sum telescopes. Now, Proposition \[prop:Sp3h\] (c)&#10;gives , and by definition of (see ), . With these substitutions, and ,&#10;we verify that Now, , , , and as noted in (b), Proposition&#10;\[prop:Sp3h\], and part (c) show that . Combining gives .&#10;&#10;For such that implies , we extend by defining For such , Lemma&#10;\[lem:iotah\] (b) and (c) give provided is sufficiently large in terms&#10;of .

For and , we have as can be seen by applying the&#10;definition of and changing the order of summation. For , each sum over&#10;on the right-hand side enumerates a translation of , so the entire sum&#10;(i.e. the left-hand side) is equal to . Whence&#10;&#10;Since we similarly have Subtracting gives for . In a similar fashion, we&#10;obtain in the case . An analogous argument gives the same results for .&#10;&#10;Applying the definition of and changing the order of summation yields&#10;&#10;In the proof of Proposition \[prop:sssa\], we also make use of basic&#10;lattice point counting arguments, as in the final two lemmas below.&#10;&#10;\[lem:dethap\] Let be as in . Set , or set . Fix an integer , and a&#10;number that depends on only. Also, fix . For , we have where in the&#10;summand.&#10;&#10;Let . Let us first show that, for any squarefree integer , Let be&#10;pairwise distinct integers and suppose that divides . Then, since is&#10;squarefree, there exist pairwise coprime positive integers such that and&#10;, . Therefore, where on the right-hand side, the outermost sum is over&#10;all decompositions of as a product of positive integers, and .&#10;&#10;Consider the decomposition . Let us define for . Notice that . By the&#10;Chinese remainder theorem, the condition on in the innermost sum above&#10;is equivalent to being in some congruence class modulo , uniquely&#10;determined by . The sum is therefore equal to . Iterating this argument&#10;times we see that the inner sum over is equal to The bound follows by&#10;combining and noting that, since is squarefree, the number of ways of&#10;writing as a product of positive integers is , and that .&#10;&#10;For , with pairwise distinct, nonzero integers, and any , we trivially&#10;have . If as well, then implies . From this and , it follows that where&#10;in the summand on the left. Now, for we have , and . Applying these&#10;bounds to the left-hand side of , we see that it is where , here and&#10;below, denotes a sufficiently large number depending on , which may be a&#10;different number at each occurrence.&#10;&#10;By definition of , for every , we have or for some , where is as in .&#10;Therefore, as a direct consequence of Lemma \[lem:omegabnd\], we have&#10;More specifically, for every , we have or for some uniquely determined ,&#10;where is squarefree and .

Consequently,&#10;&#10;Now, as can be seen by writing and changing order of summation; also&#10;(See .) Next, note that since , Combining all of this gives Finally, we&#10;obtain by combining with and .&#10;&#10;\[lem:lip\] Fix an integer and a bounded convex set .

Let be any element&#10;of with , and partition into cubes with running over . Each is a point&#10;in a unique cube of this form: we call a [-INTERIOR]{} point if this&#10;cube is entirely contained in , and a [-BOUNDARY]{} point if this cube&#10;has a nonempty intersection with the boundary of . We partition into&#10;-interior points and -boundary points. As runs over all -interior points&#10;of , () runs over a pairwise disjoint union of complete residue systems&#10;modulo , none of which contain . By Lemma \[lem:cancel\] (we have for&#10;each ), it follows that&#10;&#10;By , and the aforementioned trivial bound for , For each with , the&#10;proof of Lemma \[lem:lip\] (see ) shows that there are cubes that have a&#10;nonempty intersection with the boundary of . For each such boundary cube&#10;, the corresponding -boundary points are all in , which is a product of&#10;complete residue systems modulo , and, given that (and hence ), the&#10;condition is equivalent to when , .&#10;&#10;If follows that, for with , and for , we have by .

<outline text="Jetsam" _note="Sums of two squares are historically, perhaps, the most studied integers&#10;after the primes. (See Volume II, Chapter VI of Dickson’s [HISTORY OF&#10;THE THEORY OF NUMBERS]{} .) The special case of Brahmagupta’s identity,&#10;is implicit in Diophantus’ [ARITHMETICA]{}, and was also derived by&#10;Fibonacci (in his [LIBER QUADRATORUM]{}), Bachet, and doubtless many&#10;others. Fermat’s theorem on sums of two squares, which was anticipated&#10;by Girard and first completely proved by Euler, states that all primes&#10;are sums of two squares. Because sums of two squares are not congruent&#10;to modulo , we are led to the well-known characterization of nonzero&#10;sums of two squares as the integers whose canonical factorization is of&#10;the form&#10;&#10;This is a starting point for a proof of Landau’s result . A refinement&#10;of Landau’s proof (see or )) shows that there exists a sequence of&#10;(explicitly given) numbers such that, for all , we have Unfortunately,&#10;are difficult to evaluate numerically. As stated by Shanks , “an&#10;unsolved problem of interest is to find \[an approximation to \] that&#10;could be computed without undue difficulty by a [CONVERGENT]{} process,&#10;and which would be accurate to for \[any given\] ”. Apropos of this, a&#10;rare “mistake” of Ramanujan is often recounted (see , , or for&#10;instance).&#10;&#10;Unaware of Landau’s work, Ramanujan claimed, in his very first&#10;correspondence with Hardy dated 1913 (see ), that where the “small&#10;error” is of order . After partial integration, Ramanujan’s claim would&#10;imply that in . However, it turns out that , as was shown by Shanks (by&#10;correcting earlier work of Hardy’s student Stanley ). Even so,&#10;Ramanujan’s incorrect estimate for is, as pointed out by Shanks ,&#10;numerically a better approximation than (because is close to ). We&#10;mention this lest the numerical evidence in support of Conjectures&#10;\[con:poisdist\] and \[con:sotsktups\] be not all that striking. Also,&#10;we are circumspect in making more exact conjectures as to the nature of&#10;the error term implicit in .&#10;&#10;In general, sequences like the sequence of sums of two squares, which&#10;are “survivors” of a sieving process of positive dimension, are expected&#10;to have many properties in common with the sequence of primes.&#10;“Folklore” conjectures entail analogs of the Hardy–Littlewood prime&#10;-tuples conjecture for such sequences. Given the history outlined above,&#10;there is particular interest in the specific case of sums of two&#10;squares, yet it seems difficult to find an explicit formulation of a&#10;-tuples conjecture for sums of two squares in the literature.&#10;&#10;\[prop:S2est\] For we have&#10;&#10;Let , and let be the integer such that .

Let be the integer such that . By we have&#10;&#10;Putting this into , we again obtain . In any case, putting into , we&#10;finally obtain As , we can disregard this sum in the above -term. We&#10;complete the proof by noting that is in one-to-one correspondence with&#10;the integers whose prime divisors all lie in , and so .&#10;&#10;\[prop:sssak=2\] For we have&#10;&#10;It suffices to establish the estimate for integral , so we assume for&#10;convenience that is an integer with . By Lemma \[lem:sssak=2aux1\], we&#10;have For any prime and integers and , depends only on , i.e. . Using&#10;this, our assumption that is an integer, and partial summation, we&#10;verify that (In fact this holds for any integer and any set of primes .)&#10;&#10;Let be any number with , and let be any set of primes. In what follows,&#10;to ease notation we we set We have where the last equality is obtained&#10;by partial summation.

Finally, notice&#10;(recall Definition \[def:Sss\]) that The sum converges absolutely in&#10;view of and the following elementary bound, which we will also use in&#10;the proof of Proposition \[Jprop:sssa\]. Recall that for , and .&#10;&#10;\[Jlem:omegabnd\] Fix any number satisfying . For we have, uniformly for&#10;nonzero integers , the bound where denotes summation restricted to&#10;squarefree integers.&#10;&#10;Let . We first consider the case . Note that because and by one of&#10;Mertens’ theorems. Now, the inner sum being for and for . Thus, If then&#10;this last sum is ; otherwise, repeating the argument as many times as&#10;necessary gives It is straightforward to deduce from this that for any&#10;nonzero integer , Letting be any nonzero integer, we trivially have ,&#10;hence&#10;&#10;\[Jlem:dethap\] Fix an integer , and a squarefree integer . For we have&#10;&#10;Let be pairwise distinct integers and suppose divides . Then, since is&#10;squarefree, there exist pairwise coprime positive integers such that and&#10;, . Therefore, where on the right-hand side, the outermost sum is over&#10;all decompositions of as a product of positive integers, and .&#10;&#10;Consider the decomposition . Let us define for .

Iterating this argument&#10;times we see that the inner sum over is equal to The result follows by&#10;combining and noting that, since is squarefree, the number of ways of&#10;writing as a product of positive integers is , and that .&#10;&#10;Before the final lemma, let us introduce one more piece of notation. For&#10;, and are nonempty. For integers , let and for , define Note that in the&#10;exponent we have the parameter , not .

Writing and developing the&#10;product, the sum in over becomes&#10;&#10;We have hence&#10;&#10;By Lemma \[Jlem:cancel\] (b), , for squarefree and , we see, upon noting&#10;that , that . Similarly, applying Lemma \[Jlem:cancel\] (b), , we&#10;obtain, for squarefree and , the bound . Furthermore, by the lower bound&#10;in , we have .
