  <outline text="Introduction" _note="The concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) was introduced by Bak&#10;Tang and Wiesenfeld in 1987 , to explain the abundant fractal structures&#10;in nature, e.g. mountain ranges, river networks, power law tails in the&#10;distribution of earthquake intensities etc. The SOC refers to the&#10;non-equilibrium steady state of slowly driven systems, which show&#10;irregular burst like relaxations with a wide distribution of event&#10;sizes. The power law correlations of different physical quantities,&#10;extending over a wide range of length and time scales is a signature of&#10;criticality. Usually, reaching a critical state requires fine tuning of&#10;some control parameters e.g. temperature and magnetic field for the&#10;Ising model with a given interaction strength. However in SOC the&#10;systems reach a critical state under their own dynamics, irrespective of&#10;the initial states and without any obvious fine tuning of parameters.&#10;&#10;In the last two decades a large amount of study is focused on&#10;understanding the mechanism of SOC. The questions regarding the&#10;universality classes of the critical states has still not been&#10;completely settled. Many theoretical models have been studied to address&#10;these issues. Most of these are cellular automata models with discrete&#10;or continuous variables, evolving under deterministic or stochastic&#10;evolution rules (see for a review). Among them the Abelian Sandpile&#10;Model (ASM) is studied the most, mainly because of its analytical&#10;tractability using the Abelian property.&#10;&#10;The standard ASM first proposed in is defined on a lattice with height&#10;variables at each site , which is equal to the number of sand grains at&#10;that site. There is a threshold value for each site, and any site with&#10;height is said to be unstable. The system in a stable configuration is&#10;driven by adding a single grain at a randomly chosen site. If this&#10;addition makes the system unstable, it relaxes by the following toppling&#10;rule: All the unstable sites at one time step transfers one grain each&#10;to all its nearest neighbors. Grains can move out of the lattice by&#10;toppling at the boundary. When the system reaches a stable configuration&#10;it is again driven by adding a grain and the process is repeated. The&#10;model reaches a steady state, in which the probability distribution of&#10;the size of events has power law tail.&#10;&#10;The ASM defined on an **infinite** lattice when driven by adding grains&#10;only at a **single** site and relaxed, produces beautiful and complex&#10;patterns in height variables (see figure ). They are one of the examples&#10;where complexity arises from simple rules. In section \[sec:first\] we&#10;analyze some of these patterns and develop a detailed and exact&#10;mathematical characterization of them.&#10;&#10;There are different variants of the ASM that have been proposed. We&#10;study two well known models among them.&#10;&#10;First is the Zhang model. This is similar to the ASM, but with&#10;continuous non-negative variables, usually referred as energy. At any&#10;time step all the unstable sites relax by equally distributing all its&#10;energy amongst its nearest neighbors, with their energy reducing to&#10;zero. Energy can also move out of the system by toppling at the&#10;boundary. The driving is done by adding energy to a randomly chosen site&#10;and the amount of the energy is chosen at random from a distribution.&#10;&#10;The second is a stochastic variant of the ASM. The first stochastic&#10;sandpile model was proposed by Manna and it is known as Manna model. The&#10;model is non-Abelian, but one can construct stochastic relaxation rules&#10;with Abelian character. We consider one such stochastic Abelian sandpile&#10;model introduced in . The model is similar to the ASM with non-negative&#10;integer height variables and a threshold value defined at each site. The&#10;driving is also done by adding one sand grain at a randomly chosen site&#10;in a stable configuration. The difference is in the relaxation rules: On&#10;toppling number of grains are transfered, each grain moving independent&#10;of others to the nearest neighbors with equal probability and the height&#10;at the toppling site reduces by . For the one dimensional model defined&#10;on a linear chain, with , there are three possible events in a toppling&#10;at site : Both the neighbors and gets one grain each. Probability of&#10;this event is . Other two possibilities are that both the grains move&#10;either to the left or to the right neighbor, each event with probability&#10;.">

  <outline text="The spatial patterns in theoretical sandpile models" _note="While real sand, poured at one point on a flat substrate, produces a&#10;rather simple conical pyramid shape, nontrivial patterns are generated&#10;this way in the ASM on an infinite lattice. One such pattern on a square&#10;lattice with threshold height , produced by adding grains at the origin&#10;in an initial uniform distribution of heights , is shown in the figure .&#10;&#10; \[fig:btw\]&#10;&#10; \[fig:flatone\]&#10;&#10;The reason for interest in these patterns is two fold.&#10;&#10;Firstly, these are analytically tractable examples of complex patterns&#10;that are obtained from simple deterministic evolution rules. Here&#10;complexity means that we have structures with variations, and a complete&#10;description of which is long. Thus, a living organism is complex because&#10;it has many different working parts, each formed by variations in the&#10;working out of the same, but relatively much simpler genetic coding.&#10;&#10;Secondly, these patterns have the very interesting property of&#10;PROPORTIONATE GROWTH. This is a well-known feature of biological growth&#10;in animals, where different parts of the growing animal grow at roughly&#10;the same rate, keeping their shape almost the same. Our interest in&#10;studying the sandpile patterns comes from these being the simplest model&#10;of proportionate growth with non-trivial patterns. Compare the two&#10;patterns in figure produced on the same background but with different&#10;values of . The pattern grows in size and finer features become&#10;discernible at the center, but the overall shape of the pattern remains&#10;same. Most of the other growth models studied in physics literature,&#10;such as the Eden model, the diffusion limited aggregation, or the&#10;surface deposition, do not show this property . In these models, the&#10;growth is confined to some active outer region. The inner structures,&#10;once formed are frozen in and do not evolve further in time.&#10;&#10;The standard square lattice produces complicated patterns and it has not&#10;been possible to characterize them so far. We consider a pattern which&#10;is simpler but still complex. The pattern is produced on the F-lattice&#10;which is a variant of the square lattice with directed edges. The&#10;lattice with checker board distribution of heights is shown in figure&#10;\[fig:flatt\]. Each site has equal number of incoming and outgoing&#10;arrows. The threshold height is and any unstable site relaxes by giving&#10;away one particle each in the direction of the outgoing arrows. The&#10;pattern produced by centrally seeding grains on the checkerboard&#10;background is shown in the figure \[fig:flatone\].">
    <outline text="The characterization of the pattern" _note="We take some qualitative features of the observed pattern as input and&#10;show how one can get a complete and quantitative characterization of the&#10;pattern in the asymptotic limit of .&#10;&#10;In models with proportionate growth, it is natural to describe the&#10;asymptotic pattern in terms of the rescaled coordinate where is the&#10;diameter of the pattern, suitably defined, and is the position vector of&#10;a site on the lattice. The function increases in steps with and goes to&#10;infinity as . In the asymptotic limit the pattern can be characterized&#10;by a function which gives the local density of sand grains in a small&#10;rectangle of size about the point , with where and are the x and y&#10;components of the rescaled position vector . We define as the change in&#10;density from its background value.&#10;&#10;The pattern is composed of large regions where the heights are periodic&#10;and we call these regions as patches. Inside each patch is constant and&#10;takes only two values, either or .&#10;&#10;Let be the number of topplings at site when number of grains have been&#10;added and then relaxed. Define a rescaled toppling function where the&#10;floor function is the largest integer less than or equal to . From the&#10;conservation of sand grains in the toppling process, it follows that&#10;satisfies the Poisson equation&#10;&#10;The complete specification of determines the density function and hence&#10;the asymptotic pattern. The condition that determines is the requirement&#10;that inside each patch of constant density, it is a quadratic function&#10;of and . Considering that there are only two types of patches and that&#10;satisfies (\[eq:poisson\]) we write for the patches with and for the&#10;patches with . Each patch is characterized by the values of the&#10;parameters ,,, and . The continuity of and its derivatives along the&#10;boundary between two adjacent patches imposes linear relations among the&#10;corresponding parameters. Using these relations we show that and take&#10;only integer values. Each patch with its parameters , and can be labeled&#10;by the pair . The pair can be taken as the Cartesian coordinates of the&#10;adjacency graph of the patches, which for this pattern is a square&#10;lattice on a two sheeted Riemann surface. We show that the function ,&#10;with , satisfies the discrete Laplace’s equation on the adjacency graph.&#10;Using the asymptotic dependence of close to the site of addition, we&#10;show that for large , Solution of the discrete Laplace’s equation on&#10;this adjacency graph with the above boundary condition is difficult to&#10;determine. We numerically calculate the solution on finite adjacency&#10;graphs and extrapolate our results to the asymptotic limit. We also show&#10;that the pattern has an exact eight-fold rotational symmetry.">

    <outline text="The effect of multiple sources or sinks" _note=" \[fig:fsink\]&#10;&#10;We also studied the patterns where the grains are added at more than one&#10;site or those formed in presence of sink sites. One such pattern on the&#10;F-lattice with the checker board background in presence of a line of&#10;sink sites is shown in the figure . There are still only two types of&#10;patches and like the single source case, the spatial distances can be&#10;expressed in terms of the solution of the discrete Laplace’s equation on&#10;the adjacency graph. However, the structure of the adjacency graph&#10;changes. For the pattern in figure , the adjacency graph is still a&#10;square lattice but on a Riemann surface of three sheets. We have&#10;explicitly worked out the spatial distances by numerically solving the&#10;Laplace’s equation on this graph. We have also studied the case with two&#10;sites of addition and quantitatively characterized the pattern.&#10;&#10;The most interesting effect of the sink sites is that it changes how&#10;different spatial lengths in the pattern scale with the number of added&#10;grains . For example, in the absence of sink sites, the diameter of the&#10;pattern in figure \[fig:flatone\] grows as , for large , whereas in&#10;presence of a line of sink sites next to the site of addition, it&#10;changes to . More precisely, we show that in this case where and are&#10;numerical constants. For and this relation describes the dependence of&#10;for in the range of to , with unexpectedly high accuracy where both&#10;sides of the above equation differs by at most .&#10;&#10;We have also studied the case in which the source site is at the corner&#10;of a wedge angle , where the wedge boundaries are absorbing. We show&#10;that the relation similar to (\[eq:lrel\]) is where . This analysis is&#10;extended to other lattices with different initial height distribution,&#10;and also to higher dimensions.">

    <outline text="The compact and non-compact growth" _note=" \[fig:trione\]&#10;&#10;The growth rate of the patterns closely depends on the background height&#10;distribution. When the heights at all sites on the background are low&#10;enough, one gets patterns with growing as in d-dimensions. We refer to&#10;this growth as the compact growth. However if sites with maximum stable&#10;height in the background form an infinite cluster we get avalanches that&#10;do not stop, and the pattern is not-well defined. We describe our&#10;unexpected finding of an interesting class of backgrounds, that show an&#10;intermediate behavior. For any , the avalanches are finite, but the&#10;diameter of the pattern increases as , for large , with . We call this&#10;as non-compact growth. The exact value of depends on the background.&#10;These patterns still show proportionate growth.&#10;&#10;We characterize one such pattern in the asymptotic limit for which .&#10;This pattern is produced on a triangular lattice with directed edges&#10;with the background shown in the figure \[fig:trilatt\]. The threshold&#10;height is and the toppling rules are similar to the model on the&#10;F-lattice. The corresponding pattern is shown in figure \[fig:trione\].&#10;We show that for this pattern the rescaled toppling function is&#10;piece-wise linear in and . The adjacency graph is also simpler, it is a&#10;hexagonal lattice and like the previous examples, the spatial distances&#10;in the pattern are expressed in terms of the solution of the Laplace’s&#10;equation on this graph. We determine the solution in a closed integral&#10;form.">

  <outline text="Emergence of quasi-units in the Zhang model" _note="The Zhang model in one dimension has the remarkable property that in&#10;spite of the randomness in the amount of energy added during driving,&#10;the steady state energy per site has a very sharply peaked distribution&#10;in which the width of the peak is much less than the spread in the input&#10;amount. One such distribution is shown in figure \[fig:emergence\]. The&#10;threshold energy and the driving energy is chosen from a uniform&#10;distribution in the range . The distribution has a spike at and a peak&#10;at with a standard deviation . In general the width of the peak&#10;decreases with the increase of the system size.&#10;&#10; \[fig:emergence\]&#10;&#10;This behavior was noticed in numerical simulations in both one and two&#10;dimensions, and it is called as “emergence of quasi-units”. It is argued&#10;that for large systems, the behavior would be the same as in the&#10;discrete model . Fey et. al. have shown that for some choices of the&#10;distribution of input energy, in one dimension, the variance of energy&#10;does go to zero as length of the chain goes to infinity. However they&#10;did not show how fast the variance decreases with .&#10;&#10;We study the emergent behavior in the one-dimensional model by looking&#10;at how the added energy is redistributed among different sites in the&#10;relaxation process. Let the amount of energy for driving at time be&#10;chosen randomly from a uniform interval . The time is counted in terms&#10;of the relaxation steps and at one time step all the unstable sites&#10;relax together. We write the amount of driving energy at time as where&#10;is uniformly distributed in the interval . We decompose the energy&#10;variable at a site in a relaxation time step as where refers to the&#10;nearest integer value. The integer part evolves as the integer heights&#10;in the ASM. The function is independent of and is a linear function of .&#10;The precise function depends on the evolution history which is&#10;determined by the initial configuration and the sequence of addition&#10;sites up to time . We assume that at starting time , the variable are&#10;zero for all , and the initial configuration is a recurrent&#10;configuration of the ASM. We define by We show that this is equal to the&#10;probability of a marked grain in the corresponding ASM, added at the&#10;site at time following the history , to be found at site at time Then we&#10;show that the variance of energy in the steady state at a site can be&#10;written as where The overbar denotes averaging over the evolution&#10;histories .&#10;&#10;The function has been studied in , but for the calculation is much more&#10;difficult. However analyzing the behavior in different limits we&#10;introduce a phenomenological expression for it and show that in the&#10;large limit the variance of energy at a site has a scaling form . We&#10;determine an approximate form of the scaling function where and are&#10;numerical constants. This expression agrees very well with the results&#10;of our numerical simulation.">

  <outline text="Stochastic models of SOC" _note="The sandpile models with stochastic toppling rules are important&#10;subclass of SOC models. These models are able to describe the avalanche&#10;behavior seen experimentally in the piles of granular media much better&#10;than the deterministic models . Also in the numerical studies, one gets&#10;better scaling collapse, and consequently, more reliable estimates for&#10;the values of the critical exponents, than for the models with&#10;deterministic toppling rules . There is good numerical evidence that&#10;these models constitute a universality class different from their&#10;deterministic counter parts .&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, at present, the theoretical understanding of the models&#10;with stochastic toppling rules is much less than the deterministic&#10;models, even the characterization of the steady state is not known for&#10;the one-dimensional Manna model.&#10;&#10;We consider the Manna model with Abelian toppling rule on a linear chain&#10;of length , described in section \[sec:intro\]. Any stable state of the&#10;model is expressed as a linear combination of the stable height&#10;configurations with the coefficients being the probability of finding&#10;the system in that configuration. We define an addition operator&#10;corresponding to the addition of grains at the site , which acting on a&#10;stable state takes it to another stable state achieved following the&#10;stochastic relaxation rule.&#10;&#10;The Abelian property of the operators is shown in . However, unlike the&#10;deterministic ASM, the inverse operator need not exist. This makes the&#10;determination of the matrix form of the operators difficult for this&#10;model. In a straightforward exact numerical calculation of the steady&#10;state one needs to invert a matrix of size . We use the operator algebra&#10;of the addition operators to obtain an efficient method which requires&#10;inverting a matrix only of size .&#10;&#10;Using the conservation of sand grains during toppling we show that In&#10;general the operators need not be diagonalizable. However, using the&#10;Abelian property we construct a common set of generalized eigenvectors&#10;for all the operators such that in this basis the matrices&#10;simultaneously reduce to the Jordan block form. Corresponding to each&#10;block there is at least one common eigenvector. Then from eq. (\[eg\]),&#10;the eigenvalues satisfy with the boundary condition . We reduce this set&#10;of coupled quadratic equations to a set of linear equations by taking&#10;square root where . There are different choices for the set of different&#10;’s and for each such choice, we get a set of eigenvalues . In general&#10;there will be degenerate sets of eigenvalues. We show that degeneracies&#10;are possible only for and the set can at most be doubly degenerate. This&#10;implies that the largest dimension of a Jordan block is . We determine&#10;the matrix elements inside each block in terms of the solution of a set&#10;of coupled linear equations.&#10;&#10;We define a transformation matrix between this generalized eigenvector&#10;basis and the height configuration basis. where is the basis vector&#10;corresponding to the height configuration and is the th generalized&#10;eigenvector. Any height configuration can be generated by an appropriate&#10;sequence addition operators acting on the all empty configuration. As&#10;the action of the addition operators on the generalized eigenvectors are&#10;known, this determines the elements of the transformation matrix .&#10;&#10;Given we can get the eigenvectors of the addition operators in the&#10;configuration basis, in particular, the steady state vector, by the&#10;inverse transformation&#10;&#10;We numerically calculate the inverse matrix and determine the exact&#10;steady state for systems of small sizes. This result is then&#10;extrapolated to determine the asymptotic density profile in the steady&#10;state. Our results suggest that the steady state density averaged over&#10;all sites approaches the asymptotic density as with which is close to&#10;the Monte Carlo estimate . We also find that the ratio of probabilities&#10;of the most probable to the least probable configuration varies as . We&#10;show that the steady state is not a product measure state.&#10;&#10;The method described is easily generalized to other stochastic Abelian&#10;sandpile models and we discuss some examples of them.">

  <outline text="Self-organized criticality (SOC)" _note="One of the most striking aspects of physics is the simplicity of its&#10;laws. Maxwell’s equations, Schrodinger’s equation, and Hamiltonian&#10;mechanics are simple and expressible in few lines. However every place&#10;we look, outside the textbook examples, we see a world of amazing&#10;complexity: huge mountain ranges, scale free coastlines, the delicate&#10;ridges on the surface of sand dunes, the interdependencies of financial&#10;markets, the diverse ecologies formed by living organisms are few&#10;examples. Each situation is highly organized and distinctive, but&#10;extremely complex. So why, if the basic laws are simple, is the world so&#10;complicated? The idea of Self Organized Criticality was born aiming to&#10;give an explanation for this ubiquitous complexity . In this chapter the&#10;basic concepts related to SOC, that will be important for this thesis,&#10;are introduced.&#10;&#10;The examples, cited above, share a common feature: a power-law tail of&#10;the correlations. Consider the two point correlation of a quantity ,&#10;where is the height at a place in a mountain range, and is its average&#10;value. The function increases as , with the exponent varying very little&#10;for different mountain ranges. Similar distribution with extended tails&#10;is observed in many other natural phenomena: Gutenberg-Richter law in&#10;earth quake , Levy distribution in stock market price variations , Hacks&#10;law in River networks etc. Such power-law distributions entail scale&#10;invariance — there are no macroscopic spatial scales other than the&#10;system size, in terms of which one can describe the system, making it&#10;complex.&#10;&#10;Such features are familiar to physicist in equilibrium systems&#10;undergoing phase transition. In standard critical phenomena there are&#10;control parameters such as temperatures, magnetic field, which requires&#10;to be fine tuned by an external agent, to reach the critical point. This&#10;is unlikely to happen in naturally occurring processes such as formation&#10;of mountain ranges, earth quakes or even stock markets. These are&#10;non-equilibrium systems brought to their present states, by their&#10;intrinsic dynamics — and not by a delicate selection of temperature,&#10;pressure or similar control parameters. [^1].&#10;&#10;In the summer of 1987, Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld(BTW) published a paper&#10;proposing an explanation to such ubiquitous scale invariance. They&#10;argued that the dynamic which gives rise to the robust power-law&#10;correlations seen in the non-equilibrium steady states in nature must&#10;not involve any fine tuning of parameters. It must be such that the&#10;systems under their NATURAL EVOLUTION are driven to a state at the&#10;boundary between the stable and unstable states. Such a state then shows&#10;long range spatio-temporal fluctuations similar to those in equilibrium&#10;critical phenomena. The complex features appear spontaneously due to a&#10;cooperative behavior between the components of the system. They called&#10;this self-organized criticality as the system self-organizes to its&#10;critical steady state.&#10;&#10;SOC nicely compliments the idea of chaos. In the latter, dynamical&#10;systems with a few degrees of freedom, say as little as three, can&#10;display extremely complicated behavior. However, a statistical&#10;description of this randomness is predictable in the sense that, the&#10;signals have a white noise spectrum, and not a power law tail. A Chaotic&#10;system has little memory of the past, and it is easy to give a&#10;statistical description of such behavior. In short, chaos does not&#10;explain complexity. On the other hand, in SOC, generally, we start with&#10;systems of many degrees of freedom, and find a few general features&#10;which are also statistically predictable, but has a power-law spectra&#10;leading to complex behavior. In certain dynamical systems, E.G.,&#10;logistic maps, there are points (the Feigenbaum point ) in the parameter&#10;space, which separates states with a predictable periodic behavior and&#10;chaos. At this transition point there is complex behavior, with&#10;power-law correlations. SOC gives description of how systems, under&#10;their own dynamics, without external monitoring, reaches this very&#10;special point (“edge of chaos”), explaining the robust complex behavior&#10;in natural systems.&#10;&#10;In the book “How nature works?”, Per Bak gives various kinds of natural&#10;examples of SOC, of which the canonical one is the sandpile. On slowly&#10;adding grains of sand to an empty table, a pile will grow until its&#10;slope becomes critical and avalanches start spilling over the sides. If&#10;the slope is too small, each grain just stays at the place where it&#10;lands or creates a small avalanche. One can understand the motion of&#10;each grain in terms the local properties, like place, the neighborhood&#10;around it etc. As the process continues, the slope of the pile become&#10;steeper and steeper. If the slope becomes too large, a large&#10;catastrophic avalanche is likely, and the slope will reduce. Eventually,&#10;the slope reaches a critical value where there are avalanches of all&#10;sizes. At this point, the system is far out of balance, and its behavior&#10;can no longer be understood in terms of the behavior of localized&#10;events. The system is invariably driven towards its critical state.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Per Bak, in his book , puts this in an interesting comment—“The&#10;    nature is operated by a ’blind watchmaker’ who is unable to make&#10;    continuous fine adjustments”">

  <outline text="Theoretical models" _note="In order to have a mathematical formulation of SOC, BTW studied a&#10;so-called cellular automata known as the sandpile model , which is&#10;discrete in space, time and in its dynamical variables. The model is&#10;defined on a two dimensional square lattice where each site has a state&#10;variable referred as height, which takes only positive integer values.&#10;This integer can be thought of as representing the amount of sand at&#10;that location or in another sense it represents the slope of the&#10;sandpile at that point. Neither of these analogies is fully accurate,&#10;the model has aspects of both. One should consider it as a mathematical&#10;model of SOC, rather than an accurate model of physical sand.&#10;&#10;A set of local dynamical rules defines the evolution of the model: At&#10;each time step a site is picked randomly, and its height is increased by&#10;unity. In this thesis, this step will be referred as the DRIVING. If the&#10;height now is greater than or equal to a threshold value , the site is&#10;said to be unstable. It relaxes by toppling whereby four sand grains&#10;leave the site, and each of the four neighboring sites gets one grain.&#10;If there are any unstable sites remaining, they too are toppled, all in&#10;parallel. In case of toppling at a site at the boundary of the lattice,&#10;grains falling outside the lattice are removed from the system. This&#10;process continues until all sites are stable. This completes one time&#10;step. Then, another site is picked randomly, its height is increased by&#10;, and so on.&#10;&#10;The following example illustrates the dynamics. Let the lattice size be&#10;and suppose at some time step the following configuration is reached&#10;where all sites are stable. We now add a grain of sand at randomly&#10;selected site: let us say the central site is chosen. Then the&#10;configuration becomes the following The central site is not stable, and&#10;therefore it will topple and the configuration becomes This&#10;configuration has two unstable sites, so both will topple in parallel.&#10;Since these are at the boundary, two grains will be lost, on toppling.&#10;The new result is and further toppling leads to This is a configuration&#10;with all sites stable. One speaks in this case of an avalanche of size ,&#10;since there are four topplings. Another measure is the number of steps&#10;required for relaxation, which in this case is . For large lattices, in&#10;the steady state, the distribution of avalanche sizes and durations&#10;display a long power-law tail, with an eventual cutoff determined by the&#10;finite size of the system.&#10;&#10;Since the original sandpile model by BTW a large number of variations of&#10;the model have been studied (see for reviews). These are mostly extended&#10;systems with many components, which under steady drive reaches a steady&#10;state where there are irregular burst like relaxations and long ranged&#10;spatio temporal correlations. It is to be noted that in these models the&#10;complexity is not contained in the evolution rules itself, but rather&#10;emerges as a result of the repeated local interactions among different&#10;variables in the extended system.&#10;&#10;In the rest of this chapter, I will introduce three of the most studied&#10;models of sandpile and the techniques used to analyze them.">
    <outline text="Deterministic abelian Sandpile Model (DASM)" _note="This is the most studied model due to it analytical tractability. In a&#10;series of papers, Deepak Dhar and his collaborators have shown that this&#10;model has some remarkable mathematical properties. In particular, the&#10;critical state of the system has been well characterized in terms of an&#10;abelian group. In the following I will generally follow the discussion&#10;in .&#10;&#10;The model is a generalized BTW model on any general graph with sites&#10;labeled by integers . To make things precise, I will start with some&#10;definitions. A configuration for the sandpile model is specified by a&#10;set of integer heights defined on the sites of the graph. We denote a&#10;threshold value of the height at a site as . The system is driven like&#10;the BTW model by adding one sand grain at a randomly chosen site which&#10;increases the height at that site by . The toppling rules are specifies&#10;by a toppling matrix such that on toppling at site , heights at all&#10;sites are updated according to the rule: For example in the BTW model on&#10;a square lattice Evidently the matrix has to satisfy some conditions to&#10;ensure that the model is well behaved. These are&#10;&#10;, for all . (Height decreases at the toppled site)&#10;&#10;, for all . (Heights at other sites are increased or unchanged)&#10;&#10; for all . (Sand is not generated in toppling)&#10;&#10;Each site is connected through toppling events to at least one site&#10;where sand can be lost, such as the boundary.&#10;&#10;Without loss of generality we choose (This only amounts to defining the&#10;reference level for the height variables).&#10;&#10;With this convention, if all are initially non-negative they will remain&#10;so, and we restrict ourself to configurations belonging to that space,&#10;denoted by . Let be the space of stable configurations denoted by where&#10;the height variables at each site are below threshold. The property&#10;above ensures that stability will always be achieved in a finite time.&#10;&#10;We formalize the addition of sand to a stable configuration by defining&#10;an “addition operator” so that is the new stable configuration obtained&#10;by taking and then relaxing.&#10;&#10;The mathematical treatment of ASM relies on one simple property it&#10;possesses: The order in which the operations of particle addition and&#10;site toppling are performed does not matter. Thus the operators commute&#10;I.E. The proof uses the linearity of the toppling processes . In the&#10;relaxation processes represented by the two sides of the above equation,&#10;the order of topplings can be changed, but the final configurations are&#10;equal. An example of this abelian nature is the process of long addition&#10;of multi-digit numbers. In this example the toppling process is like&#10;carrying.&#10;&#10;Note that, there are some “garden of Eden” configurations that once&#10;exited can not be reached again. For example, in the BTW model on square&#10;lattice, system can never reach a state with two adjacent . This is&#10;because in trying to topple a site to zero, the neighbor gains a grain,&#10;and vice versa. This leads to the definition of the recurrent state&#10;space which consists of any stable configuration that can be achieved by&#10;adding sand to some other recurrent configuration. This set is not empty&#10;since one can always reach a minimally stable configuration defined by&#10;having all .&#10;&#10;Dhar proved another remarkable property that the addition operators have&#10;unique inverses when restricted to the recurrent space; that is, there&#10;exists a unique operator such that for all in . This can be easily seen&#10;from the fact that there are finite number of configurations in , so for&#10;some positive period , with a recurrent configuration. Using the abelian&#10;property it can be shown that the period is same for all . Then is the&#10;inverse for .&#10;&#10;These properties of have some interesting consequences . One is that in&#10;the steady state all the recurrent configurations are equally probable.&#10;Also, the number of recurrent states is simply the determinant of the&#10;toppling matrix . For large square lattices of sites this determinant&#10;can be found easily by Fourier transform. In particular, whereas there&#10;are stable states, there are only recurrent states. Thus starting from&#10;an arbitrary state and slowly adding sand, the system self-organizes to&#10;an exponentially small subset of states, which are the attractor of this&#10;dynamics.&#10;&#10;There are many more interesting properties of the DASM, E.G., using a&#10;burning algorithm , it is possible to test whether an arbitrary&#10;configuration is recurrent. Using this algorithm it can also be shown&#10;that the model is related to statistics of spanning-trees on the&#10;lattice, as well as with the limit of the Potts model . As several&#10;results are known about spanning tree these equivalence help in relating&#10;properties of DASM to known properties of spanning trees.&#10;&#10;In spite of these interesting mathematical properties, the exponents&#10;characterizing the power-law tail in the distribution of avalanches are&#10;still difficult to determine analytically on most lattices, and computer&#10;simulations are still needed. In fact, on a square lattice, the&#10;numerical values estimated by different people have shown a wide range&#10;of values. It has been argued that the simple finite size scaling does&#10;not work for the avalanche distribution and instead it has a&#10;multi-fractal character . In some simpler quasi-one dimensional lattices&#10;it has been shown that simple linear combination of two scaling forms&#10;provides an adequate description .&#10;&#10;For higher dimensional lattices it has been shown by Priezzhev that the&#10;upper critical dimension for the models is . For lattices of dimension&#10;above , the avalanche exponents take mean field values and can be&#10;deduced from the exact solution of the model on a Bethe lattice .">

    <outline text="Zhang model" _note="The Zhang model, introduced by Zhang in 1989, differs from the DASM in&#10;two aspects: first, the height variables are continuous and takes&#10;non-negative real values. A site is unstable if its height is above&#10;threshold, and it topples by equally dividing its entire content among&#10;its nearest neighbors, and itself becoming empty. Second, the external&#10;perturbation is not by adding height , but by a quantum chosen randomly&#10;from an interval , where are positive real numbers.&#10;&#10;Here, is an example of the Zhang model in one dimension. Let the&#10;threshold height is , same for all , and an initial configuration is Now&#10;a time step begins by an addition to a random site, of a random amount&#10;chosen from the interval . Let the amount is and the site is the central&#10;site. After addition the result is Because the middle site is unstable,&#10;an avalanche starts: In case of two or more unstable sites, all are&#10;toppled in parallel.&#10;&#10;Since the addition amount is random, a stable site could in principle&#10;have any height between zero and the threshold and the stationary&#10;distribution could be very different from that of the DASM, where only&#10;discrete values are encountered. Nevertheless, when one simulates the&#10;model on large lattices in one and two dimensions, the stationary&#10;heights tend to concentrate around nonrandom discrete values. This is&#10;known as the “emergence of quasi-units” . It appears that altering the&#10;LOCAL toppling rules of the DASM, does not have that much effect on the&#10;GLOBAL behavior after all, if the lattice size is large.&#10;&#10;This behavior led to the conjecture that in the thermodynamic limit the&#10;critical behavior is identical to that of DASM. However, due to the&#10;changed toppling rules, the dynamics is no longer abelian, and&#10;determining the steady state is quite difficult, even in one-dimension.&#10;In fact, Blanchard ET. AL. have shown that the probability distribution&#10;of heights in the steady state, even for the two site problem, has a&#10;multi-fractal character .&#10;&#10;This status was unchanged for over a decade until Fey ET. AL. showed&#10;that on a one-dimensional lattice, for some specific choice of the&#10;amount of addition, the toppling becomes abelian. Using this they showed&#10;that, indeed, the model is on the same universality class of the DASM.&#10;However, the analysis in two dimension is still an open problem.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Manna model" _note="Another important class of the sandpile models are with stochastic&#10;toppling rules. The first model of its kind was studied by Manna in&#10;1991, and is known as the Manna model .&#10;&#10;The evolution rules of this sandpile in -dimensions are very similar to&#10;the ones defined for the DASM. In fact, the driving rule and the&#10;dissipation rules at the “boundary” remain the same. But in a toppling,&#10;an unstable site redistributes ALL THE SAND GRAINS between sites&#10;randomly chosen amongst its nearest neighbors. The randomness in the&#10;evolution rule is a relevant change in the dynamics, which makes it&#10;non-abelian. It is possible to get back the abelianness by a simple&#10;modification in the toppling rule, which I will discuss in detail in the&#10;later chapters. However, the addition operators defined appropriately do&#10;not form a group anymore and this makes the analysis less tractable even&#10;for a linear chain.&#10;&#10;The steady state is very different from its deterministic counter part&#10;E.G. on a simple linear chain the different recurrent states are not&#10;equally probable, unlike the deterministic model. Also the avalanche&#10;distribution can be satisfactorily described by simple finite size&#10;scaling. Another evidence of the differences between these models is in&#10;the way the avalanches spread over the lattice . The distribution of&#10;number of toppling per site in a typical avalanche for both DASM and&#10;Manna model on a square lattice are shown in Fig. \[fig:ava\]. For the&#10;DASM, one can see a shell structure in which all sites that toppled&#10;times form a connected cluster with no holes, and these sites are&#10;contained in the cluster of sites that toppled times, and so on. On the&#10;other hand, the toppling distribution exhibits a random avalanche&#10;structure with many peaks and holes.&#10;&#10; \[fig:ava\]&#10;&#10;For many years, the universality of the manna model was a controversial&#10;question. At present there are convincing numerical evidences that in&#10;dimension up to , they have a different critical behavior, from its&#10;deterministic counterpart, with a different set of critical exponents.&#10;However in dimensions , both DASM and Manna model take the same&#10;mean-field values of critical exponents.">

  <outline text="Universality in the sandpile models." _note="Since the work by BTW, a large number of different models have been&#10;studied E.G. sandpile models with many variations of the BTW toppling&#10;matrix or sand grain distribution rules , stochastic topplings , with&#10;activity inhibition , continuous height models , loop erased random walk&#10;, Takayasu aggregation model , train model , non-abelian sandpile&#10;directed sandpile model , forest-fire model , Olami-Feder-Christensen&#10;model ETC (and many more could have been defined). Most of these models&#10;could only be studied numerically, and for a while it seemed that each&#10;new variation studied belong to a new universality class each with its&#10;own set of critical exponents. It is a fair question to ask, what is the&#10;generic behavior?&#10;&#10;Although this question is not yet resolved completely, by now, there has&#10;been a fair amount of understanding of this problem. The universality&#10;classes with renormalization group flow in these models can be&#10;summarized in the Fig. \[fig:universality\].&#10;&#10;There are sufficient numerical evidence that sandpile models with&#10;deterministic toppling rules (DASM) and stochastic toppling rules (Manna&#10;model) constitute different universality classes. There are also several&#10;other model which show critical exponents different from these two .&#10;They are related to the directed percolation (DP) , which describes the&#10;active-absorbing state phase transition in a wide class of&#10;reaction-diffusion systems. The activity in avalanches in sandpile can&#10;grow, diffuse or die, and any stable configuration is an absorbing&#10;state. Thus one would expect that in general the sandpile should belong&#10;to the universality class of active-absorbing state transition with many&#10;absorbing states . However, these models do not involve any conserved&#10;fields. In Manna and DASM-type models, it is this presence of&#10;conservation laws of sand that makes the critical behavior different&#10;from DP .&#10;&#10;Recently, the effect of non-conservation has been explicitly studied by&#10;introducing stickiness in the toppling rules (I.E. there is small&#10;probability that the incoming particles to a site get stuck there, and&#10;do not cause any toppling until the next avalanche hits the site, thus&#10;in effect there is no conservation of grains within an avalanche). It&#10;has been argued that as long as the sand grains have non-zero&#10;stickiness, the distribution of avalanche sizes follows directed&#10;percolation exponents. The DASM, and the stochastic Manna-type models&#10;are unstable to this perturbation, and the renormalization group flows&#10;are directed away from them to the directed percolation fixed point, as&#10;schematically shown in the figure. This picture is exactly verified in&#10;DIRECTED sandpiles. However, the argument is less convincing for&#10;undirected models, and the issues is not settled .">

  <outline text="Experimental models of SOC" _note="Soon after the sandpile model was introduced, several experimental&#10;groups measured the size distribution of avalanches in granular&#10;materials. Unfortunately, real sandpile do not seem to behave as the the&#10;theoretical models. Experiments show large periodic avalanches separated&#10;by quiescent states with only limited activity. While for small piles&#10;one could try to fit the avalanche distribution with power-law over a&#10;limited range, the behavior would eventually cross over, on increasing&#10;the system size, to a state which is not scale-invariant . It is later&#10;realized that inertia of rolling grains is the reason for&#10;non-criticality. A large avalanche propagating over a surface with slope&#10;scours the surface, and takes away materials from it. The final angle,&#10;after the avalanche has stopped, is bellow . So if we want to see&#10;power-law avalanches, we have to minimize the effect of inertia of the&#10;grains. This is achieved in an experiment in Oslo by using rice grains.&#10;Because of the elongated shape of the rice grains (Fig.&#10;\[fig:ricepile\]) frictional forces are stronger and these poured at&#10;very small rate gave rise to a convincing power-law avalanche&#10;distribution .&#10;&#10;A similar power law distribution of avalanche sizes are obtained in&#10;motion of domain walls in ferro-magnets and flux lines in type II&#10;superconductors . A more recent experimental realization of SOC is&#10;obtained in suspensions of sedimenting non-brownian particles by slow&#10;periodic shear .&#10;&#10;It is worth mentioning that SOC has been invoked in several other&#10;situations in geophysics (atmospheric precipitation , river pattern due&#10;to erosion , landslides ), biology (neural-network ), economics&#10;(stock-market crashes ) and many more. I have deliberately chosen the&#10;above experimental examples for which experimental observations are&#10;accurate and reproducible.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Remarks" _note="Originally, SOC was proposed with the aim of providing an explanation of&#10;the ubiquitous complexity in nature . The abundance of fractal&#10;structures in nature, temporal as well as spatial, was considered to be&#10;an effect of a generic tendency — pertinent to most many-body systems —&#10;to develop by themselves in to a critical scale-invariant state.&#10;&#10;However, certainly not all systems that organize themselves into one&#10;specific state will, when gently driven, exhibit scale invariance in&#10;that self-organized state. The experiments of real sandpiles referred&#10;earlier are a prime example. Neither is all observed power law behavior&#10;are an effect of dynamical self-organization into a critical state. The&#10;work by Sethna and co-workers on Barkhausen noise is an interesting&#10;example of this, what Didier Sornette has called “Power laws by sweeping&#10;of an instability” .&#10;&#10;Since the introduction of the idea, a large amount of discussion went&#10;into understanding the minimum conditions for a model to be&#10;self-organized critical. Though a broad picture has emerged in last two&#10;decades, it is still not complete and controversial. In the rest of this&#10;section, I will discuss two of the most discussed properties, using both&#10;examples and counter examples.&#10;&#10;**Slow driving limit.** There is a strong belief in the community that&#10;an essential ingredient of SOC is SLOW DRIVING (driving and dynamics&#10;operating at two infinitely separated timescales, I.E. avalanches are&#10;instantaneous relative to the time scale of driving). This idea got&#10;widely accepted after an argument given by Dickman ET. AL.. They argued&#10;that the dynamics in the sandpile model implicitly involve tuning of the&#10;DENSITY of grains to a value where a phase transition takes place&#10;between an active state, where topplings take place, and a quiescent&#10;“absorbing” state. When the system is quiescent, addition of new&#10;particles increases the density. When the system is active, particles&#10;are lost to the sinks via toppling, decreasing the density. The slow&#10;driving ensures that these two density changing mechanisms balance one&#10;another out, driving the system to the threshold of instability.&#10;&#10;However in the Takayasu model of aggregation the driving is fast. A&#10;simple example, it can be defined on a linear chain on which particles&#10;are continuously injected, diffuse and coalesce. One can write the&#10;explicite rules as follows:&#10;&#10;-   At each time step, each particle in the system moves by a single&#10;    step, to the left or to the right, taken with equal probability,&#10;    independent of the choice at other sites.&#10;&#10;-   A single particle is added at every site at each time step.&#10;&#10;-   If there are more than one particle at one site, they coalesce and&#10;    become a single particle whose mass is the sum of the masses of the&#10;    coalescing parts. In all subsequent events, the composite particles&#10;    acts as a single particle.&#10;&#10;The probability distribution of total mass at a randomly chosen site,&#10;has power law tail, with an upper cutoff that increases with time. This&#10;is a signature of criticality. The analogue of avalanches in this model&#10;is the event of coming together of large masses. In fact, it can be&#10;shown that the model is equivalent to a directed version of sandpile. In&#10;this example, it is clear that the driving is fast, and the rate is&#10;comparable to the local movements of the particles.&#10;&#10;**Conservation.** Conservation of grains is also considered as a key&#10;property for the criticality to emerge in sandpile models. A simple&#10;intuitive argument goes as follows: the sand grains introduced in the&#10;pile can dissipate only by reaching the diffusive “boundary” of the&#10;lattice. Owing to this and because of the vanishing rate of sand&#10;addition, arbitrarily large avalanches (of all possible sizes) must&#10;exist for an arbitrarily large system size, yielding a power-law size&#10;distribution. In contrast, in the presence of non-vanishing bulk&#10;dissipation, grains disappear at some finite rate, and avalanches stop&#10;after some characteristic size determined by the dissipation rate. This&#10;clearly says that bulk dissipation is a relevant perturbation in the&#10;SANDPILE DYNAMICS and breaks the criticality .&#10;&#10;There are also some other models of SOC like Forest fire , OFC model&#10;where it was shown, mostly numerically, that non-conservation in the&#10;dynamics leads to non-critical steady state.&#10;&#10;However, extrapolating these results and considering conservation as a&#10;neccesarry criteria for SOC, in general, is not correct. A model which&#10;is clearly non-conservative and still, when slowly driven displays&#10;power-law in the avalanche size distribution is discussed in . Another&#10;two non-conservative models of SOC are a sandpile model with threshold&#10;dissipation, and Bak-Sneppen model of evolution .&#10;&#10;Finally, one could ask: Has SOC, taught us anything about the world that&#10;we did not know prior to it? Jensen addresses this question very nicely&#10;in his book. The most important lesson is that, in a great variety of&#10;systems, particularly for slowly-driven-interaction- dominated-threshold&#10;systems, it is misleading to neglect fluctuations. In these systems,&#10;sometimes, the fluctuations are so large that the fate of a major part&#10;of the system can be determined by a single burst of activity. Dinosaurs&#10;may have become extinct simply as a result of an intrinsic fluctuation&#10;in a system consisting of a highly interconnected and interacting web of&#10;species; there may be no need for an explanation in terms of external&#10;bombardment by meteorites. FLUCTUATIONS ARE SO LARGE THAT THE “ATYPICAL”&#10;EVENTS DECIDES THE FUTURE OF THE SYSTEM. This new insight is&#10;sufficiently important to justify and inspire more theoretical, and&#10;experimental research in SOC.">

  <outline text="Overview of the later chapters" _note="The work in this thesis ranges from characterizing the spatial patterns&#10;in sandpile model, to quasi-units in the stationary distribution of&#10;Zhang’s model, and determining exact steady state of Manna model. The&#10;first three chapters in the following are about sandpile as a growth&#10;model, where we show how well-structured non-trivial patterns emerge at&#10;large length scales, due to local interactions in cellular lengths where&#10;the patterns are not obvious. In chapter \[ch:zhang\] we discuss another&#10;emergent behavior in the Zhang model. Chapter \[ch:manna\] contains an&#10;operator algebraic analysis of the stochastic sandpile models. Here is a&#10;brief summary of these chapters.&#10;&#10;**Chapter 4:** While a considerable amount of research went into&#10;characterizing the universality classes of sandpile models and&#10;understanding the mechanism of SOC, very limited work is done about&#10;spatial patterns in sandpile models. Such patterns were noted around the&#10;time when sandpile was first introduced . Yet, very little is known&#10;about them.&#10;&#10;This chapter is devoted to the study of a class of such spatial patterns&#10;produced by adding sand at a SINGLE site on an INFINITE lattice with&#10;initial periodic distribution of grains and then relaxing using the DASM&#10;toppling rules. We present a complete quantitative characterization of&#10;ONE such patterns. We show that the spatial distances in the asymptotic&#10;(in the limit when large number of grains are added) patterns produced&#10;by adding a large number of grains, can be expressed in terms solution&#10;of discrete Laplace’s equation (discrete holomorphic functions ) on a&#10;grid on two-sheeted Riemann surface.&#10;&#10;We also discuss the importance of these patterns as a paradigmatic model&#10;of growth where different parts of the structure grow in proportion to&#10;each other, keeping their shape the same. We call these kind of growth&#10;as PROPORTIONATE GROWTH. We discuss the importance of such growth in&#10;real world examples.&#10;&#10;**Chapter 5:** In this chapter we describe how the pattern changes in&#10;presence of absorbing sites, reaching which the grains get lost and no&#10;longer participate in the avalanches. We show that, again, the&#10;ASYMPTOTIC pattern can be characterized in terms of discrete holomorphic&#10;functions, but on a different lattice. Similar effects of multiple sites&#10;of addition on the pattern are also calculated.&#10;&#10;The most interesting effect of the sink sites is the change in the rate&#10;of growth of the pattern. In absence of sink sites the diameter of the&#10;pattern, suitably defined, increases as where is the number of sand&#10;grains added in the lattice. When the pattern grows with the sink sites&#10;inside, the growth rate of the diameter changes, in general, to , where&#10;the exponent depends on the sink geometries. For example, , when the&#10;sink sites are along an infinite line adjacent to the site where grains&#10;are dropped. When the site of addition is inside a wedge of angle with&#10;the sink sites along the wedge boundary, this value of the exponent is .&#10;We use an scaling argument and determine , for some simple&#10;sink-geometries.&#10;&#10;**Chapter 6:** The growth rate also depends on the arrangement of&#10;heights in the background, and this dependence is quite intriguing. When&#10;the initial heights are low ENOUGH at all sites, one gets patterns with&#10;, in -dimension. If sites with maximum stable height in the starting&#10;configuration form an infinite cluster, we get avalanches that do not&#10;stop, and the model is not well-defined. In this chapter, we study&#10;backgrounds in two dimensions. We describe our unexpected finding of an&#10;interesting class of backgrounds, that show an intermediate behavior:&#10;For any , the avalanches are finite, but the diameter of the pattern&#10;increases as , for large , with , the exact value of depending on the&#10;background. It still shows proportionate growth. We characterize the&#10;asymptotic pattern exactly for one illustrative example.&#10;&#10;**Chapter 7:** As mentioned, the Zhang model on one and two dimensional&#10;lattices displays a remarkable property: emergence of quasi-units, where&#10;the continuous heights, in spite of the randomness in the driving, are&#10;peaked around a few discrete non-random values. Fey ET. AL have shown&#10;that on a linear chain the width of the distribution vanishes in the&#10;infinite volume limit. However they did not show how it approaches zero.&#10;&#10;In this chapter, we show that, the sequence of toppling of the&#10;continuous height variables, when suitably discretized, have an&#10;one-to-one relation with that of integer heights in the corresponding&#10;DASM. We use this relation to show that the width of the distribution of&#10;heights decreases in inverse power of the length of the chain. We also&#10;determine how the variance of height at a site, changes with position of&#10;the site along the length of the system.&#10;&#10;**Chapter 8:** This chapter contains an algebraic approach of&#10;determining the steady state of a class of sandpile models with&#10;stochastic toppling rules. The original Manna model, as discussed in&#10;section 1.2.3, does not have the abelian property of its deterministic&#10;counterpart. However, a simple modification of the toppling rules makes&#10;the model abelian . A similar construction is possible for other&#10;stochastic toppling rules. However, analysis of these models are still&#10;difficult as the corresponding addition operators (see section&#10;\[sec:dasm\]), in general, does not have an inverse, and are not&#10;diagonalizable.&#10;&#10;We show that, in principle, the operators can be reduced to a Jordan&#10;block form, using the algebra satisfied by these. These are then used to&#10;determine the steady state of the models. We illustrate this procedure&#10;by explicitly determining the numerically exact steady for a stochastic&#10;model on a linear chain. Using the desktop computers at our disposal, we&#10;have been able to perform the calculation for systems of size and also&#10;studied the density profile in the steady state.">

<outline text="Pattern formation on growing sandpiles" _note="BASED ON THE PAPER by Deepak Dhar, Tridib Sadhu and Samarth Chandra.&#10;&#10;[ ]{}">
  <outline text="Introduction" _note="As discussed in details in chapter \[ch:intro\], the sandpile models&#10;were introduced in physics in the context of self-organized criticality,&#10;where the main interest has been the power-law tail in the distribution&#10;of avalanche sizes . In this chapter our interest is different. We study&#10;the pattern produced by adding large number of sand grains at a single&#10;site in a two dimensional DASM starting from a periodic background, and&#10;allowing the system to relax using the sandpile toppling rule (See&#10;chapter 1). For example, consider the ASM on an INFINITE square lattice&#10;with initial heights , for all sites, and add large number of grains at&#10;the origin. The distribution of heights in the relaxed configuration,&#10;produces a very beautiful, but complex pattern (Fig. \[asm\]) [^1]. In&#10;this chapter, we give a detailed quantitative characterization of&#10;similar patterns produced on two directed lattices, starting from a&#10;simple periodic background.&#10;&#10;These patterns are examples of complex patterns obtained from simple&#10;deterministic evolution rules, and are also analytically tractable. Here&#10;complexity means that we have structures with variations, and a complete&#10;description of which is long. Thus, a living organism is complex because&#10;it has many different working parts, each formed by variations in the&#10;working out of the same, but relatively much simpler genetic coding.&#10;There are some earlier known theoretical examples of complex patterns&#10;obtained from local deterministic evolution rules. Most studied among&#10;them are the Conway’s game of life , which is a cellular automata model&#10;with local update rules, and Turing patterns , which are&#10;reaction-diffusion models. In general, a detailed and exact mathematical&#10;characterization of such patterns has not been possible so far. In this&#10;aspect the sandpile patterns are important as they are analytically&#10;tractable. Understanding these should also help in studying the more&#10;general problem. The most important aspect of these patterns is that,&#10;these are the simplest examples that show nontrivial spatial features&#10;with [PROPORTIONATE GROWTH]{} (see Fig. \[fig:prop\]), where these&#10;features grows in proportion, keeping the overall shape same. Examples&#10;of proportionate growth are abundant in the animal kingdom, where a&#10;young animal, typically, grows in size with time, with different parts&#10;of the body growing roughly at the same rate. Obviously, this kind of&#10;growth requires some coordination and communication between different&#10;parts. While there are many models of growing objects studied in physics&#10;literature so far, e.g. the Eden model, Diffusion-Limited Aggregation&#10;(DLA), invasion-percolation etc. , none has this property. All of these&#10;are mainly models of aggregation, where growth occurs by accretion on&#10;the surface of the object, and inner parts do not evolve significantly&#10;(Fig. \[fig:dla\]). It is worth mentioning, that modelling proportionate&#10;growth with simple structures is easy, E. G., growth of a water droplet&#10;as one injects more water into it. However, generating a complex pattern&#10;with large number of structures inside, all growing at same rate,&#10;maintaining their relative shape, is highly nontrivial. This is what&#10;happens in the patterns produced in the sandpile models.&#10;&#10;Also, there is an astonishing qualitative similarity between the&#10;formation of these patterns and the way a fertilized egg develops into a&#10;well structured multicellular organism. The development starts with a&#10;single cell which divides into more cells, and then they divide in turn.&#10;At some stage of the development, few cells generate newer types of&#10;cells and form organs. This process continues and after a long time it&#10;forms a large complex, but highly coordinated cellular assembly. The&#10;same genetic code in each cell is responsible for the cell&#10;differentiation and structure formation. In the abelian sandpile when&#10;the sand grains are added at the same site, the grains redistribute&#10;themselves and a pattern emerges around the addition site, which grows&#10;as more and more sands are added. The same redistribution rule is used&#10;for all sites, and yet the pattern has large visibly distinguishable&#10;structures inside, which, one can think of as different organs in an&#10;animal. This simple mathematical model of growing sandpile captures&#10;these qualitative features, even though the actual mechanism of growth&#10;is much more complicated in the biological world.&#10;&#10;The spatial patterns in sandpile models were first discussed by Liu ET&#10;AL. . The asymptotic shape of the boundaries of the sandpile patterns&#10;produced by adding grains at a single site in different periodic&#10;backgrounds was discussed in . Borgne ET AL. obtained bounds on the rate&#10;of growth of these boundaries and later these bounds were improved by&#10;Fey ET AL. and Levine ET AL. . The first detailed analysis of different&#10;periodic structures found in the patterns were carried out by Ostojic in&#10;. Other spatial configurations in the abelian sandpile models, like the&#10;identity or the stable state produced from special unstable states, also&#10;show complex internal self-similar structures , which share common&#10;features with the patterns studied here. In particular, the identity&#10;configuration on the F-lattice has recently been shown to have spatial&#10;structure similar to what we study here . There are other models, which&#10;are related to the abelian sandpile model, e.g. the Internal&#10;Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (IDLA), Eulerian walkers (also called the&#10;rotor-router model), and the infinitely-divisible sandpile, which also&#10;show similar structure. For the IDLA, Gravner and Quastel showed that&#10;the asymptotic shape of the growth pattern is related to the classical&#10;Stefan problem in hydrodynamics, and determined the exact radius of the&#10;pattern with a single point source . Levine and Peres have studied&#10;patterns with multiple sources in these models recently, and proved the&#10;existence of a limit shape.&#10;&#10;[^1]: A natural sandpile, formed by pouring sand grains at a constant&#10;    rate on a flat table with boundaries, gives rise to singular&#10;    structures like ridges, in the stationary state. This has been&#10;    attracted much attention recently">

  <outline text="Definition of the model" _note="The pattern on a standard square lattice is rather complicated&#10;(Fig.\[asm\]), and it has not been possible to characterize it so far.&#10;In this chapter, we consider two variations of the square lattice,&#10;assigning orientations to its edges, such that each site has two inward&#10;and two outward arrows, as shown in Fig.\[lattice\]a and&#10;Fig.\[lattice\]b. They are known as F-lattice and Manhattan lattice,&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;We define a position vector on the lattice, . The DASM is defined on the&#10;lattice by a height variable , at each site . In a stable configuration&#10;all sites have height . The system is driven by adding grains at a&#10;single site and if this addition makes the system unstable it relaxes by&#10;the toppling rule: each unstable site transfers one grain each in the&#10;direction of its outward arrows. We start with an initial checkerboard&#10;configuration in which for sites with even, and otherwise. Clearly, the&#10;average density of sand grains for the initial configuration is per&#10;site. For numerical purpose we use a lattice large enough so that none&#10;of the avalanches reaches the boundary. The result of adding grains at&#10;the origin is shown in Fig. \[flattice\] and Fig. \[manhattan\], for the&#10;two lattices.&#10;&#10;The asymptotic pattern in large limit, for the two lattices are&#10;indistinguishable from each other, at large scales, except that the thin&#10;lines of ’s forming two triangles outside the octagon are rotated by&#10;(Fig.\[manhattan\]). Since the lattices are different, this is quite&#10;intriguing. Specially there is no obvious lattice symmetry, and it is&#10;easily checked that patterns produced for small are quite different&#10;(Fig.\[small\]).&#10;&#10;This pattern is somewhat simpler than in Fig.\[asm\], which makes its&#10;study easier. We shall discuss here only the F-lattice, but the&#10;discussion is equally applicable to the Manhattan lattice. Taking some&#10;qualitative features of the observed pattern (e.g. only two types of&#10;patches are present, and they are all - or - sided polygons) as input,&#10;we show how one can get a complete and [ QUANTITATIVE]{}&#10;characterization of the pattern. We also show that the ASYMPTOTIC&#10;pattern has an unexpected exact -fold rotational symmetry, and determine&#10;the exact coordinates of all the boundaries in it. We will also discuss&#10;some other cases, where exactly the same asymptotic pattern is obtained.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Characterizing asymptotic pattern: A general theory" _note="We first describe a general method of formally characterizing a large&#10;number of sandpile patterns, not just the three patterns shown till now.&#10;We start by defining as the diameter of the pattern when grains have&#10;been added. The exact definition of is flexible, and the&#10;characterization does not depend on the choice. For the patterns in Fig.&#10;\[asm\], \[flattice\], and \[manhattan\] we choose as the width of the&#10;smallest rectangle that encloses all sites that have toppled at least&#10;once.&#10;&#10;As mentioned before, the patterns exhibit proportionate growth, I.E.,&#10;all structures in the pattern grows at the same rate to the diameter.&#10;While there is as yet no rigorous proof of this important property, we&#10;assume this in the following discussion. Then, it is natural to describe&#10;the patterns in the reduced coordinates defined by and . A position&#10;vector in these reduced coordinates is defined by . Then in the limit ,&#10;the patterns can be characterized by a function which gives the local&#10;density of sand grains in a small rectangle of size about the point ,&#10;with , . We define as the change in density from its initial background&#10;value.&#10;&#10;A large number of sandpile patterns, including the one in Fig. \[asm\],&#10;\[flattice\], and \[manhattan\], are made of a union of distinct&#10;regions, called “Patches”, inside which the heights are periodic in&#10;space. Then, inside each patch is constant. For example, in the pattern&#10;in Fig. \[flattice\], there are only two types of patches, and the&#10;change in density takes only two possible values, in a high-density&#10;patch (color yellow in Fig. \[flattice\]) and in a low-density patch&#10;(color orange). There are few defect-lines, which move with , and can&#10;also be seen in Fig.\[asm\] and Fig.\[flattice\]. But these can be&#10;ignored in discussing the asymptotic pattern.&#10;&#10;Let be the number of topplings at site the when the diameter reaches the&#10;value for the first time. Define where , with being the floor function&#10;which gives the largest integer . From the conservation of sand-grains&#10;in the toppling process, it is easy to see that where the sum is over&#10;the sites nearest neighbors of , and is the number of them. Then in the&#10;rescales coordinate, satisfies the Poisson equation In an electrostatic&#10;analogy, we can think of as an areal charge density, and as the&#10;corresponding electrostatic potential. A COMPLETE SPECIFICATION OF&#10;DETERMINES THE DENSITY FUNCTION WHICH IN TURN CHARACTERIZES THE&#10;ASYMPTOTIC PATTERN.&#10;&#10;The key observation that allows us to determine the asymptotic pattern&#10;is the following proposition.&#10;&#10;Inside each patch of periodic heights, is a quadratic function of and .&#10;\[lemma1\]&#10;&#10;A proof can be done in the following way. Within a patch, the function&#10;is Taylor expandable around any point inside the patch. where and .&#10;Consider any term of order in the expansion, for example the term . This&#10;can only arise due to a term in . Then, considering the fact that is an&#10;integer function of the coordinates, it is easy to see that it will&#10;change discontinuously at intervals of . This leads to change in the&#10;periodicity of heights at such intervals inside each patch which&#10;themselves are of size . This would then result in an infinitely many&#10;defect-lines in the asymptotic pattern. However there are no such&#10;features in Fig.\[asm\] or Fig.\[flattice\]. Therefore inside each&#10;periodic patch of constant , can at most be quadratic in and .&#10;&#10;The argument finally boils down to proving the two features of the&#10;pattern, I.E., there is proportionate growth, and that the pattern can&#10;be decomposed in terms of periodic patches.&#10;&#10;In each periodic patch the toppling function is a sum of two terms: a&#10;part, that is a simple quadratic function of and , and another is a&#10;periodic part. The periodic part averages to zero, and does not&#10;contribute to the coarse-grained function [^1]. The quadratic part, when&#10;rescaled, can be written as where are constants inside a patch, and ,&#10;corresponding to the patch. Then each patch is characterized by the&#10;values of these parameters.&#10;&#10;Now we will show that the continuity of and its first derivatives along&#10;the boundary between adjacent patches imposes linear relations among the&#10;corresponding parameters. Consider two neighboring periodic patches and&#10;with mean densities and respectively. Let the rescaled quadratic&#10;toppling function be and in these patches. Then the boundary between the&#10;patches is given by the equation . As the derivatives of are also&#10;continuous across the boundary, the boundary between two periodic&#10;patches must be a straight line, and where is the perpendicular distance&#10;of from the boundary. We can start with a periodic patch , and go to&#10;another patch by more than one path. Since the final quadratic function&#10;at should be the same whichever path we take, this imposes consistency&#10;conditions which restrict the allowed values of slopes of the&#10;boundaries. Consider a point where periodic patches meet, with&#10;(Fig.\[matching\]). If the th boundary at this point makes an angle with&#10;the -axis, and the density of the patch in the wedge is&#10;(Fig.\[matching\]), then the condition that the net change in the&#10;quadratic form is zero if we go around once, reduces to the following&#10;condition: with . For , with , this equation has only trivial solutions&#10;with equal to or for all . Hence, only are allowed.&#10;&#10;These linear equations amongst the parameters corresponding to&#10;neighboring patches, can be solved and this will determine the complete&#10;potential function , giving a quantitative characterization of the&#10;pattern.&#10;&#10;[^1]: In some patterns, with other backgrounds (not discussed here)&#10;    there are regions that occupy finite fraction area of the full&#10;    pattern, which show aperiodic height patterns. These cases are&#10;    harder to analyse.">

  <outline text="Determination of the potential function" _note="We now apply this method, in the last section, to the F-lattice pattern&#10;in Fig. \[flattice\], and determine the exact potential function . We&#10;note that in this pattern, there are no aperiodic patches, only two&#10;types of periodic patches, where only takes values or . Also, the slopes&#10;of the boundaries between patches only take values , or . The patches&#10;are typically dart shaped quadrilaterals, and some triangles. These&#10;simplifications, not present in Fig.\[asm\], make possible a full&#10;characterization of the pattern in Fig.\[flattice\].&#10;&#10;We start by determining the exact asymptotic size of the pattern. We&#10;note from Fig.\[flattice\] that the boundary of the pattern is an&#10;octagon (we shall prove later that this is a regular octagon). In fact,&#10;there are four lines of ’s outside the octagon. But these have zero&#10;areal density in the limit , and do not contribute to . We will ignore&#10;these in the following discussion.&#10;&#10;Let be the minimum boundary square containing all () that have a&#10;non-zero charge density . We observe that can be considered as a union&#10;of disjoint smaller squares, each of which is divided by diagonal into&#10;two parts where takes values and (Fig.\[tile\]). This is seen to be true&#10;for the outer layer patches. Towards the center, the squares are not so&#10;well resolved. Assuming that this construction remains true all the way&#10;to the center, in the limit of large , the mean density of negative&#10;charge in the bounding square . Given that the total amount of negative&#10;charge is , the area of the bounding square should be . Hence, the&#10;boundaries of the minimum bounding square are This means, with our&#10;choice of the diameter as the width of the box , we have In Fig.&#10;\[fig:bdiff\], we have shown, the correction term appears to grow as .&#10;&#10;Most of the time the avalanches does not reach the boundary. They are&#10;often stopped by the defect-lines inside the patches, which breaks the&#10;periodicity of the heights. For example, there are lines of alternating&#10;’s and ’s inside the dense (all ) patches. When an avalanche enters the&#10;patch, the defect line shifts its position, partially increasing the&#10;size of the patch. An example of such event is shown in the&#10;Fig.\[succ\]. Because of this, the diameter increases in steps with the&#10;increase of (see Fig.\[fig:boundary\]).&#10;&#10;Let be the minimum number of particles that have to be added so that at&#10;least one site at topples. We find that for , , , and , , , and . This&#10;is consistent with Eq. (\[eq:boundary\]).&#10;&#10;Then, the Poisson equation, in Eq. (\[poisson0\]), for this pattern&#10;becomes, I.E., there is unit amount of point charge at the origin.&#10;&#10;We now determine the parameters in the quadratic form of the potential&#10;function. In order to do that in a consistent way, we first look at the&#10;topological structure of the pattern. We note that the patches become&#10;smaller, and there are more of them in number, as we move towards the&#10;center. One can use a coordinate transformation , to avoid this&#10;overcrowding (Fig.\[adj\]). We can now draw the adjacency graph&#10;(Fig.\[fig5\]) of the pattern, where each vertex denotes a patch, and a&#10;bond between the vertices is drawn if the vertices share a common&#10;boundary. It is convenient to think of the triangular patches in the&#10;pattern as degenerate quadrilaterals, with one side of length zero. Then&#10;we see that the adjacency graph is planar with each vertex of degree&#10;four, except a single vertex of coordination number eight corresponding&#10;to the exterior of the pattern. The graph has the structure of a square&#10;lattice wedge of wedge angle . The square lattice structure of the&#10;adjacency graph is seen more clearly, if rather than transformation, the&#10;transformation used is ( this has been used earlier in ), where , and&#10;view it in the complex -plane (see Fig.\[zsqr\]). Thus, one can&#10;equivalently represent the graph as a square grid on a Riemann surface&#10;of two sheets (fig.\[fig5\]).&#10;&#10;We now use the qualitative information obtained from the adjacency&#10;matrix of the observed pattern, to obtain quantitative prediction of the&#10;exact coordinates of all the patches. Consider an arbitrary patch ,&#10;having an excess density . The potential function in this patch is a&#10;quadratic function of and we parametrize it as The potential function in&#10;another patch having zero excess density is parametrized as Now consider&#10;two neighboring patches and with excess densities and respectively. Then&#10;using the matching conditions (see Eq. (\[continuity\])), it is easy to&#10;show that if the boundary between them is a horizontal line , we must&#10;have&#10;&#10;There are similar conditions for other boundaries. These result a&#10;coupled set of linear equations for the coefficients . The equations for&#10;and do not involve other variables. In the outermost patch, clearly ,&#10;and for this patch both and are zero. It follows that and are integers,&#10;equal to the Cartesian coordinates of the vertex corresponding to the&#10;patch in the discretized Riemann surface in Fig.\[fig5\]b. In the&#10;following, we denote a patch by integers , and write the corresponding&#10;coefficients , , and as , and . With this convention, the matching&#10;conditions in Eq.(\[a2\]) can be rewritten as Using similar matching&#10;conditions for the boundary of patch , with slope , we get the&#10;conditions We can eliminate the variables and with even using Eq.&#10;(\[10\]) and Eq.(\[11\]). Then the equations become&#10;&#10;It is convenient to introduce the complex variables , and . In these&#10;variables we can write the potential function, in Eq. (\[eq:odd\]) and&#10;(\[eq:even\]), as where overbar denotes complex conjugation.&#10;&#10;On the lattice, with odd, the natural basis vectors are and . Let us&#10;call these and . We define the finite difference operators and by Then&#10;the equations (\[a6\]-\[a9\]) can be written as&#10;&#10;These equations are the discrete analog of the familiar Cauchy-Riemann&#10;conditions connecting the partial derivatives of real and imaginary&#10;parts of an analytic function where the role of the analytic function is&#10;played by .&#10;&#10;From Eq. and Eq.(\[a9\]), it is easy to deduce that satisfies the&#10;discrete Laplace’s equation&#10;&#10;If and are large, the corresponding patch is near the origin ( is&#10;small), and where the leading behavior of is given by (see Eq.&#10;\[poisson1\]). Consider a point , such that at Then, would be expected&#10;to lie in the patch labeled by . This gives . Then, setting equal to&#10;gives us The equation (\[a10\]), subjected to the behavior at large&#10;given by Eq.(\[a12\]) on the -wedge graph (for each value of , has two&#10;values) has a unique solution. Clearly the solution has eight fold&#10;rotational symmetry about the origin in the space. This implies that&#10;Given , its real and imaginary parts determine and , and using&#10;Eq.(\[a6\], \[a7\]) we determine the exact positions of all the patch&#10;corners. The exact eight-fold rotational symmetry of the adjacency graph&#10;of the pattern, and the fact that satisfies Eq.(\[a22\]) on the&#10;adjacency graph together imply the eight-fold rotational symmetry of all&#10;the distances in the pattern.&#10;&#10;Note that for the usual square lattice, the solution of Eq.(\[a10\]) is&#10;the well known 2-dimensional lattice Greens function, that is explicitly&#10;calculable for any finite , and is a simple polynomial of with rational&#10;coefficiants . However, for our case of the two sheeted Riemann surface,&#10;we have not been able to find a closed-form formula for . But the&#10;solution can be determined numerically to very good precision by solving&#10;it on a finite grid , with the condition in Eq.(\[a12\]) imposed exactly&#10;at the boundary. We determined and numerically for , and extrapolated&#10;our results for . We find and , in perfect agreement with the exact&#10;theoretical values and , respectively, determined using the Fig.&#10;\[tile\].&#10;&#10;An interesting question to ask is, what is the size distribution of the&#10;patches? This can be easily determined from the transformation of the&#10;pattern, as shown in Fig.\[zsqr\]. In this representation, the patches&#10;are positioned around the sites of the square grid, and all the patches&#10;have similar sizes. The Jacobian of the coordinate transformation is an&#10;estimate of the area on the - plane, corresponding to a unit area around&#10;site of the grid on the - plane. For large and , it can be shown that On&#10;the other hand, from the same picture, the number of patches of area&#10;larger than or equal to the area of the patch is equal to the number of&#10;sites inside the circle of radius , on the square grid. This number&#10;increases linearly with . Then, the number of patches of area greater&#10;than or equal to is , which in turn implies that the number of patches&#10;of area lying between and would vary as .">

  <outline text="Other patterns" _note="Our calculations above can be easily extended to the patterns on any&#10;other background, on any other two dimensional lattices, so long as&#10;there are only patches with two values of . The matching conditions&#10;along the patch boundaries, ensure that the boundaries are straight&#10;lines. Although, we do not have a complete understanding of what&#10;determines the slope of the patch boundaries and the number of them for&#10;a patch, it seems, that as long as there are only two types of patches,&#10;the patches are always quadri-laterals, and the slopes of boundaries are&#10;integer multiples of . Then our analysis shows that the asymptotic&#10;pattern is same as the one for the F-latiice. For example, as mentioned&#10;already, this is true for the Manhattan lattice (Fig.\[manhattan\]), for&#10;initial density . Same happens for the the F-lattice itself, with a&#10;different periodic background of initial density 5/8 ( if even, or&#10;congruent to , or , mod ). The pattern for this case is shown in&#10;(Fig.\[f5by8\]). In this case, only the density of patches are different&#10;from the one on the checkerboard background, but the patch boundaries&#10;for the asymptotic pattern, in the rescaled coordinate, are at the&#10;identical positions.&#10;&#10;In some other cases, like the F-lattice, with initially all sites empty,&#10;the pattern is very similar, but there are some aperiodic patches in the&#10;outermost ring (Fig.\[fzero\]). Since the behavior of in such patches&#10;are not known, the equations for do not close in this case.&#10;&#10;Finally, how much of this analysis applies to the pattern in Fig.&#10;\[asm\]? As noted in , there are large number, possibly infinitely many&#10;periodic patches in the asymptotic pattern. Characterization of such&#10;patterns remains an interesting open problem.">

<outline text="Effect of multiple sources and sinks on the growing sandpile pattern[ch3]" _note="BASED ON THE PAPER by Tridib Sadhu and Deepak Dhar.&#10;&#10;In this chapter, we study the effect of sink sites on DASM patterns,&#10;discussed in chapter \[ch2\]. Sinks change the scaling of the diameter&#10;of the pattern with the number of sand grains added. For example, in two&#10;dimensions, in the presence of a sink site, the diameter of the pattern&#10;grows as for large , whereas it grows as if there are no sink sites. In&#10;the presence of a line of sink sites, this rate reduces to . We&#10;determine the growth rates for various sink geometries along with the&#10;case when there are two lines of sink sites forming a wedge, and&#10;generalizations to higher dimensions. We characterize the asymptotic&#10;pattern in the large limit for one such case, the two-dimensional&#10;F-lattice with a single source adjacent to a line of sink sites. The&#10;characterization is done in terms of the positions of different spatial&#10;features in the pattern. For this lattice, we also provide an exact&#10;characterization of the pattern with two sources, when the line joining&#10;them is along one of the axes of the lattice.">
  <outline text="Introduction" _note="In the previous chapter, we studied growing sandpiles in the abelian&#10;model on the F-lattice and the Manhattan lattice. We were able to&#10;characterize the pattern corresponding to the initial configuration in&#10;which each alternate site of the lattice is occupied, forming a&#10;checkerboard pattern. The full characterization of this pattern reveals&#10;an interesting underlying mathematical structure, which seems to deserve&#10;further exploration. This is what we do in this chapter by adding sink&#10;sites or multiple sources.&#10;&#10;The presence of sink sites changes the pattern in interesting ways. In&#10;particular, it changes how different spatial lengths in the pattern&#10;scale with the number of added grains . For example, in the absence of&#10;sink sites, the diameter of the pattern grows as for large , whereas in&#10;the presence of a single sink site, this changes to a growth. If there&#10;is a line of sink sites next to the site of addition, the growth rate is&#10;. We also study the case in which the source site is at the corner of a&#10;wedge-shaped region of wedge angle , where the wedge boundaries are&#10;absorbing. We show that for any the pattern grows as , with . This&#10;analysis is extended to other lattices with different initial height&#10;distributions, and to higher dimensions.&#10;&#10;We also study the exact characterization of the asymptotic pattern in&#10;the infinite limit for the pattern with a line of sink sites. For a&#10;single point source, as discussed in chapter \[ch2\], the determination&#10;of the different distances in the pattern requires a solution of the&#10;Laplace equation on a discrete Riemann surface of two-sheets.&#10;Interestingly, for the pattern with a line sink, we still have to solve&#10;the discrete Laplace equation, but the structure of the Riemann surface&#10;changes from two-sheets to three-sheets.&#10;&#10;We then study the effect on the pattern of having multiple sites of&#10;addition. For multiple sources, the pattern of small patches near each&#10;source is not substantially different from a single-source pattern, but&#10;some rearrangements occur in the larger outer patches. Two patches may&#10;sometimes join into one, or, conversely, a patch may break up into two.&#10;While the number of patches undergoing such changes is finite, the sizes&#10;and positions of all the patches are affected by the presence of the&#10;other source, and we show how these changes can be calculated exactly&#10;for the asymptotic pattern.&#10;&#10;This chapter is organized as follows. In Section \[ch3.2\], we discuss&#10;scaling of the diameter of the patterns with for different sink&#10;geometries. First, we consider the pattern in the presence of a line of&#10;sink sites. Then, this analysis is extended to other sink geometries:&#10;two intersecting line sinks in two dimensions and two or three&#10;intersecting planes of sink sites in three dimensions. The problem of a&#10;single sink site is a bit different from the others, and is discussed&#10;separately in Section \[ch3.3\]. In Section \[ch3.4\], we numerically&#10;verify the growth rates. The remaining sections are devoted to a&#10;detailed characterization of some of these patterns. In Section&#10;\[ch3.5\], we characterize the pattern in the presence of a line sink.&#10;In Section \[ch3.6\], we discuss the case when there are two sources&#10;present.

  <outline text="Rate of growth of the patterns" _note="For the single source pattern, discussed in chapter \[ch2\], the&#10;diameter , for large . We want to study how this dependence gets&#10;modified in the presence of sink sites.&#10;&#10;First, consider the pattern formed by adding sand grains at a single&#10;site in the presence of a line of sink sites. In the rest of this&#10;chapter we will use the same notations defined in chapter \[ch2\]. Any&#10;grain reaching a sink site gets absorbed, and is removed from the&#10;system. For simplicity let us consider the source site at and the sink&#10;sites along the -axis. A picture of the pattern produced by adding&#10;grains at is shown in Fig.\[fig:lsone\].&#10;&#10;The equation analogous to Eq. (\[poisson0\]) for this problem is for all&#10;in the right-half plane with , where is the position of the source in&#10;reduced coordinates. Also, as there is no toppling at the sink sites,&#10;must satisfy the boundary condition&#10;&#10;We can think of as the potential due to a point charge at and an areal&#10;charge density , in the presence of a grounded conducting line along the&#10;-axis. This problem can be solved using the well-known method of images&#10;in electrostatics. Let be the image point of with respect to the -axis.&#10;Define in the left half plane as Then the Poisson equation for this new&#10;charge configuration is As the function is odd under reflection,&#10;automatically vanishes along the -axis.&#10;&#10;We define as the number of sand grains that remain unabsorbed. Then&#10;where is the change in the height variables between its values before&#10;and after the system relaxes. Clearly, for large , we can write where is&#10;the infinitesimal area around . The integration is performed over the&#10;right half-plane with . We shall use the sign to denote equality up to&#10;leading order in . Since is a non-negative bounded function, exactly&#10;zero outside a finite region, this integral exists. Let its value be ,&#10;then we have&#10;&#10;Let denote the number of grains that are absorbed by the sink sites.&#10;Then considering that the grains can reach the sink sites only by&#10;toppling at its neighbors we have The factor comes from the fact that in&#10;the F-lattice, only half of the sites on the column would have arrows&#10;going out to the sink sites. Then using our scaling ansatz in equation&#10;(\[phi\]), for large, Hence Now from equation (\[poisson4\]) the&#10;potential can be written as the sum of two terms: due to two point&#10;charges and at and its image point respectively, and the term due to the&#10;areal charge density. where We first consider the case where is finite&#10;and vanishes in the large limit. Then reduces to a dipole potential, and&#10;it diverges near the origin. However, is a continuous and differentiable&#10;function for all . From the solution of the dipole potential, it is easy&#10;to show that for , where we have used polar coordinates with being&#10;measured with respect to the -axis. Here is a numerical constant, which&#10;is a property of the asymptotic pattern. Then and the integral in&#10;equation (\[na2\]) diverges as , where is the cutoff introduced by the&#10;lattice. Using it is easy to show that where is a constant. Then using&#10;equations (\[nr3\]) and (\[na3\]) and that and add up to , we get&#10;Considering the dominant term in the expression for large , it follows&#10;that increases as .&#10;&#10;For the patterns in the other limit where the source is placed at a&#10;distance such that is non-zero for , is non-singular along the sink&#10;line. Then, clearly and as a result .&#10;&#10;The above analysis can be easily generalized to a case with the sink&#10;sites along two straight lines intersecting at an angle and a point&#10;source inside the wedge. For a square lattice, and are most easily&#10;constructed, and avoid the problems of lines with irrational slopes, or&#10;rational numbers slopes with large denominators. The wedge with&#10;wedge-angle is obtained by placing the sink sites along the and -axis&#10;and the source site at in the first quadrant. The pattern with a line&#10;sink, discussed in previous section, corresponds to .&#10;&#10;For the general , the corresponding electrostatic problem reduces to&#10;determining the potential function inside a wedge formed by two&#10;intersecting grounded conducting lines. Again the potential has two&#10;contributions: the potential due to a point charge at the source site&#10;and the potential due to the areal charge density. We first consider the&#10;case where the source site is placed at a finite distance from the wedge&#10;corner such that the distance in reduced coordinates vanishes in the&#10;large limit. In this limit is a non-singular function of while diverges&#10;close to the origin. A simple calculation of the electrostatic problem&#10;gives where and we have used polar coordinates with the polar angle&#10;measured from one of the absorbing lines. Again is a constant&#10;independent of or and is a property of the asymptotic pattern. Then&#10;arguing as before, we get So the equation analogous to equation&#10;(\[scalethree\]) is For a wedge angle , , and the above equation reduces&#10;to Eq.(\[scalethree\]).&#10;&#10;Similar arguments involving conformal transformation have been used&#10;earlier in the context of equilibrium statistical physics to determine&#10;the wedge-angle dependence of surface critical exponents near a wedge .&#10;&#10;For the problem where the source site is at a distance from the wedge&#10;corner both the functions and are nonsingular close to the origin. It is&#10;easy to show that grows as .&#10;&#10;These arguments can be easily extended to other lattices with different&#10;initial height distributions, or to higher dimensions. Consider, for&#10;example, an abelian sandpile model defined on the cubic lattice. The&#10;allowed heights are from to , and a site topples if the height exceeds ,&#10;and sends one particle to each neighbor. The sites are labelled by the&#10;Cartesian coordinates , where and are integers. We consider the infinite&#10;octant defined by . We start with all heights equal to , and add sand&#10;grains at the site . We assume that the sites on planes , and are all&#10;sink sites, and any grain reaching there is lost. We add grains and&#10;determine the diameter of the resulting stable pattern.&#10;&#10;We again write the potential function in two parts: due to a point&#10;charge at and due to the bulk charge density in the presence of three&#10;conducting grounded planes. Then, a simple electrostatic calculation&#10;shows that the potential is the octapolar potential with it’s form in&#10;spherical polar coordinate as This then implies that the equation&#10;determining the dependence of on is">

  <outline text="A single sink site" _note="Let the site of addition be the origin, with the sink site placed at .&#10;We shall show that when lies in a high-density patch (color yellow in&#10;Fig.\[fig:psone\]), the asymptotic patterns are identical to the one&#10;produced in the absence of the sink site.&#10;&#10;The patterns, produced for close to , with the sink sites placed deep&#10;inside a high-density patch are simple to analyze, even for finite but&#10;large . One such pattern is presented in Fig.\[fig:psone\].&#10;&#10;We see that the effect of the sink site on the pattern is to produce a&#10;depletion pattern centered at this site. The depletion pattern is a&#10;smaller negative copy of the single source pattern, where negative means&#10;is negative of the original pattern. We define the function as the&#10;difference between the heights at in the final stable configuration&#10;produced by adding grains at the origin, with and without the sink site.&#10;From the figure it is seen that, in this case, is the negative of the&#10;pattern produced by a smaller source, centered at . The number of grains&#10;required to produce this smaller pattern is exactly the number of grains&#10;absorbed at the sink site. This is immediately seen from the fact that&#10;the toppling function satisfies where is the toppling matrix for the&#10;sandple model on the F-lattice (see chapter \[ch:intro\]). Let be the&#10;number of topplings at , when we add particles at the origin in the&#10;absense of any sink site. Since Eq. (\[discrpois\]) is a linear&#10;equation, it follows that a solution of this equation is This is a valid&#10;solution for our problem, if the corresponding heights in the final&#10;configuration with the sink are all non-negative. This happens when the&#10;region with nonzero is confined within a high-density patch of the&#10;single source pattern.&#10;&#10;The number can be determined from the requirement that the number of&#10;topplings at the sink site is zero. The potential function for the&#10;single source problem diverges as near the source. Considering the&#10;ultraviolate cutoff due to the lattice, at can be approximated by to&#10;leading order in . Then at , is approximately equal to whereas , where&#10;is the potential function for the problem without a sink. Then from the&#10;equation (\[lcomb\]) we have For large , this implies that Then, in the&#10;large limit, for a sink at a fixed reduced coordinate , the relative&#10;size of the defect produced by the sink site decreases as . Hence&#10;asymptotically, the fractional area of the defect region will decrease&#10;to zero, if the sink position is inside a high-density patch.&#10;&#10;When the sink site is inside a low-density patch, the subtraction&#10;procedure in equation (\[zsink\]) gives negative heights, and no longer&#10;gives the correct solution. However it is observed for the patches in&#10;the outer layer, where the patches are large, that the effect of the&#10;sink site is confined within the neighboring high-density patches&#10;(Fig.\[fig:pstwo\]) and rest of the pattern in the asymptotic limit&#10;remains unaffected.&#10;&#10;The pattern in which the source and the sink sites are adjacent to each&#10;other, appears to be very similar to the one produced without the sink&#10;site. This is easy to see. The Poisson equation analogous to equation&#10;(\[poisson0\]) for this problem is where is the number of grains&#10;absorbed in the sink site at . In an electrostatic analogy, as discussed&#10;earlier, can be considered as the potential due to a distributed charge&#10;of density and two point charges of strength and , placed at the origin&#10;and at respectively. It is easy to see that the dominant contribution to&#10;the potential is the monopole term with net charge . The contribution&#10;due to other terms decreases as for large , and the asymptotic pattern&#10;is the same as without a sink, with particles added.&#10;&#10;The number of particles absorbed is determined by the condition that the&#10;number of topplings at (the sink position) is zero. The potential&#10;produced at and , by the areal charge density is nearly the same. The&#10;number of topplings at , if we add particles at the sink site, is&#10;approximately . Now, from the solution of the discrete Laplacian, the&#10;number of topplings produced at due to particles added at is&#10;approximately with being an undetermined constant. Equating these two,&#10;we get As the asymptotic pattern is the same as that produced by adding&#10;grains at the origin without a sink, we have , and Simplification of&#10;this equation for large shows that grows as with .&#10;&#10;For finite , the leading correction to comes from the dipole term in the&#10;potential. This term breaks the reflection symmetry of the pattern about&#10;the origin. A measure of the bilateral asymmetry is the difference of&#10;the boundary distances on two opposite sides of the source. As the&#10;relative contribution of the dipole potential compared to the monopole&#10;term decays as , for large , this difference vanishes in the asymptotic&#10;pattern in the reduced coordinates.">

  <outline text="Numerical results" _note="All the above scaling behaviors are verified by the measurement of&#10;lengths in the patterns for finite, but large . Let be the real positive&#10;root of equation (\[scalethree\]) for a given integer value of . As&#10;takes only the integer values on the lattice, an estimate of it would be&#10;, the integer nearest to . Interestingly, we found that for a choice of&#10;and , this estimate gives values which differ from the measured values&#10;at most by for all in the range of to . We rewrite the equation&#10;(\[scalethree\]) as where we used the symbol to denote that both sides&#10;differ at most by . Clearly more precise estimates of and would be&#10;required if we want this to work for larger .&#10;&#10;Similarly for the other two equations (\[scalefour\]) and&#10;(\[scalefive\]) we find that they are in very good agreement with our&#10;numerical data. We consider the case of wedge angle . This corresponds&#10;to the case with the source site next to an infinite half-line of sink&#10;sites. Here and equation (\[scalefour\]) reduces to Choosing and , we&#10;find that the function differs from the measured values by at most for&#10;all in the range of to . Then, as in equation (\[scalethreehalf\]), we&#10;write Similarly, for the three dimensional abelian sandpile model with&#10;the source site inside the first octant and , , and as the absorbing&#10;planes, the equation determining the dependence of the diameter on is We&#10;have verified this equation for between to .&#10;&#10;We obtained these equations by determining the number of absorbed grains&#10;and the remaining grains from dimensional counting grounds, and the&#10;final equations are then only a statement of the conservation of the&#10;sand grains. It is quite remarkable that this scaling analysis gives&#10;almost the exact values of the diameter. In addition, these equations&#10;have an important feature that they include a “correction to scaling”&#10;term whereas the usual scaling analysis ignores the sub-leading powers.&#10;&#10;We also verify equation (\[nss1\]) using patterns with fixed and the&#10;sink site inside a high-density patch in the outer layer of the pattern.&#10;It is found that for a change of from to , changes by less than , which&#10;is consistent with the scaling relation.&#10;&#10;In the other limit, where the sink site is next to the source, the&#10;dependence of on is given in equation (\[scaleone\]). We measure for the&#10;patterns with the sink site at and the source at the origin.

  <outline text="Characterization of the pattern with a line sink" _note="The pattern with a line sink (Fig.\[fig:lsone\]), discussed in Section&#10;\[ch3.2\], retained two important properties present in the single&#10;source pattern (Fig. \[flattice\]). These are: The asymptotic pattern is&#10;made of the union of two types of patches of excess density and and the&#10;separating boundaries of the patches are straight lines of slope , or .&#10;However the adjacency graph is changed significantly and this changes&#10;the sizes of the patches as well. In this section we show how to&#10;explicitly determine the potential function on this adjacency graph.&#10;&#10;The adjacency graph of the patches is shown in Fig.\[fig:adjLS\]. This&#10;representation of the graph is easier to see by taking the&#10;transformation of the pattern and then joining neighboring patches by&#10;straight lines (Fig.\[fig:1byrsqr\]). Each vertex in the graph is&#10;connected to four neighbors except for the vertices corresponding to the&#10;patches next to the absorbing line. These have coordination number .&#10;Also the vertex at the center corresponding to the exterior of the&#10;pattern is connected to seven neighbors.&#10;&#10;Let us write the quadratic potential function in a patch having excess&#10;density as where the parameters , , , and take constant values within a&#10;patch. Similarly for a low-density patch&#10;&#10;Using the continuity of and its first derivatives along the common&#10;boundaries between neighboring patches it has been shown in chapter&#10;\[ch2\], that for the single source pattern without sink sites , and&#10;take integer values. The same argument also applies to this problem and&#10;it can be shown that are the coordinates of the patches in the adjacency&#10;graph in Fig.\[fig:adjLS\]. These coordinates are shown next to some of&#10;the vertices. There are two different patches corresponding to the same&#10;set of values. In fact, as in the single source pattern the adjacency&#10;graph forms a square grid on a two sheeted Riemann surface, the same is&#10;formed for this pattern, but on a three sheeted Riemann surface. This&#10;can be constructed by modifying the graph in Fig \[fig:adjLS\] keeping&#10;its topology the same. In this representation the pattern covers half of&#10;the surface with being the Cartesian coordinates on the surface.&#10;&#10;Define function on this lattice. As discussed in , the continuity of and&#10;its first derivatives along the common boundary between neighboring&#10;patches imposes linear relations between and of the corresponding&#10;patches. Using these matching conditions it can be shown that and&#10;satisfy the discrete Cauchy-Riemann conditions and then the function&#10;satisfies the discrete Laplace equation on this adjacency graph.&#10;&#10;Let us define and . As argued before, close to the origin the potential&#10;diverges as (equation (\[dipole1\])). Then, the corresponding complex&#10;potential function . As , and , it follows that for large , Also, the&#10;condition that on the absorbing line must vanish implies that for the&#10;vertices with even along the red line in Fig.\[fig:adjLS\] vanishes.&#10;These vertices correspond to the patches with the absorbing line as the&#10;horizontal boundary in Fig.\[fig:lsone\].&#10;&#10;Equation (\[laplace\]) with the above constraint and the boundary&#10;condition (Eq.(\[asdls\])) has a unique solution. The normalization of&#10;is fixed by the requirement that , which fixes the diameter of the&#10;pattern to be in reduced units. All the spatial distances in the pattern&#10;can be expressed in terms of this solution using the matching conditions&#10;between two neighboring patches. As an example, consider the boundary&#10;between the patches corresponding to and with being odd. The matching&#10;conditions only allow a horizontal boundary between them with the&#10;equation , where Similarly there is a vertical boundary between the&#10;patches and , with the equation , where The other boundaries can&#10;similarly be determined using the solution for . The characterization of&#10;the asymptotic patterns for , and is qualitatively similar and will not&#10;be discussed here.">

  <outline text="Patterns with two sources" _note="In this section we discuss patterns produced by adding grains each at&#10;two sites placed at a distance from each other along the -axis, at and&#10;with . Again, the diameter is defined as the height of the smallest&#10;rectangle enclosing all sites that have toppled at least once. The two&#10;limits, close to zero and large are trivial: For , the asymptotic&#10;pattern is the same as that produced by adding grains at a single site.&#10;On the other hand if , each source produces its own pattern, which do&#10;not overlap, and the final pattern is a simple superposition of the two&#10;patterns.&#10;&#10;As noted before, the adjacency graph for the single source pattern has a&#10;square lattice structure on a Riemann surface of two-sheets . Then the&#10;graph for two non-intersecting single source patterns is a square&#10;lattice on two disjoint Riemann surfaces, each having two-sheets&#10;(Fig.\[fig:adjnocol\]). Only the vertex at the origin represents the&#10;exterior of the pattern, which is the same for both of the single source&#10;patterns. It has sixteen neighbors and is placed midway between the two&#10;Riemann surfaces. For later convenience let us associate the lower&#10;Riemann surface to the pattern around the left source at and denote it&#10;by . Similarly the upper Riemann surface as corresponding to the pattern&#10;around the right source .&#10;&#10;For , the two single source patterns overlap. Using the abelian&#10;property, we first topple as if the second source were absent. The&#10;resulting pattern still has some unstable sites in the region where the&#10;patterns overlap. Further relaxing these sites transfers these excess&#10;grains outward, and changes the dimensions and positions of the patches:&#10;some patches become bigger, some may merge, and sometimes a patch may&#10;break into two disjoint patches.&#10;&#10;The pattern produced with two sources with is shown in&#10;Fig.\[fig:twosource\]. We see that there are still only two types of&#10;periodic patches, corresponding to values and , and the slope of the&#10;boundaries between patches takes the values , or .&#10;&#10;The relaxation due to overlap changes the adjacency graph from the case&#10;with no overlap. This modified adjacency graph, for in the range to , is&#10;shown in Fig.\[fig:adj\]. For just below , these changes are few and are&#10;listed below.&#10;&#10;\(i) We note that the patches labelled and in Fig.\[fig:edited\] have the&#10;same and dependence of the potential function . Then, for just below ,&#10;these patterns can join with each other by a thin strip. This only&#10;requires a small movement in the boundaries of nearby patches ( i.e.&#10;only a small change in the and values of nearby patches). Thus, in the&#10;adjacency graph, the vertices corresponding to and are collapsed into a&#10;single vertex in Fig.\[fig:adj\].&#10;&#10;\(ii) Similarly, the vertices corresponding to the patches and in&#10;Fig.\[fig:edited\] are collapsed into a single vertex in&#10;Fig.\[fig:adj\].&#10;&#10;\(iii) This divides the region outside the pattern in to three parts, ,&#10;and . They are also shown in Fig.\[fig:adj\] as separate vertices.&#10;&#10;\(iv) The patches marked and also have the same quadratic form, and the&#10;vertical boundary between them disappears. However, the patches and are&#10;also joined by a thin strip. This horizontal strip divides the joined&#10;and into two again (Fig.\[fig:edited\]).&#10;&#10;The adjacency of other patches remains unchanged. The adjacency graph of&#10;the pattern is shown in Fig.\[fig:adj\]. Interestingly, this new&#10;adjacency graph remains the same for all , even though for , the sizes&#10;of different patches are substantially different. Compare the pattern&#10;for in Fig.\[fig:bellow\], with the pattern for in&#10;Fig.\[fig:twosource\]: The shape of the central patches in&#10;Fig.\[fig:bellow\] is different from that in Fig.\[fig:twosource\].&#10;&#10;In Fig.\[fig:adj\], we have have placed the vertices which are formed by&#10;merging or dividing the patches, midway between the Riemann sheets&#10;corresponding to the two sources. As is decreased below , more&#10;collisions between the growing patches will occur and the number of&#10;vertices in this middle region will increase. For any nonzero , the&#10;number of vertices in the middle layer is finite. In the limit, vertices&#10;from both the surfaces and come together and form a single Riemann&#10;surface corresponding to a single source pattern around . For small, but&#10;greater than zero, the outer patches are arranged as in the&#10;single-source case, but closer to the sources, one has a crowded pattern&#10;near each source. In the adjacency graph, this corresponds to the&#10;vertices near the patch roughly arranged as on a Riemann surface of&#10;two-sheets, while the ones farther from the patch remain undisturbed on&#10;the 4-sheeted Riemann surface.&#10;&#10;We now characterize the pattern with two sources and in detail by&#10;explicitly determining the potential function on this adjacency graph.&#10;&#10;The Poisson equation analogous to Eq.(\[poisson0\]) for this problem is&#10;Let us use the same quadratic form of the potential function given in&#10;equation (\[fform1\]) and equation (\[fform2\]).&#10;&#10;Again using the same argument given in , it can be shown that and are&#10;the coordinates of the patches in both the adjacency graphs in&#10;Figs.\[fig:adjnocol\] and \[fig:adj\]. These coordinates are shown next&#10;to each vertex. Also, on this graph, the function satisfies the discrete&#10;Laplace equation where denote the neighbors of in the odd or even&#10;sublattice . Let us define where and are the coordinates corresponding&#10;to and .

The solution of&#10;the equation (\[laplace2\]) with the boundary condition and that in&#10;equation (\[asymptot\]) for large determines the final pattern.">

  <outline text="Discussion" _note="While the results discussed in quantifying the patterns with growing&#10;sandpiles are presumably exact (in the sense that can be determined to&#10;arbitrary precision), they have not been established rigorously. In&#10;particular, as noted before, it would be desirable to have a direct&#10;proof of the proportional growth property from the definition of the&#10;problem. Also, we use the observation that the asymptotic pattern&#10;consists of only two types of patches, and the adjacency graph of the&#10;pattern is also taken as observed. It would be nice to see it following&#10;from the definition of the problem. The unexpected accuracy of the&#10;scaling arguments giving Eqs. (, , , ) also deserves to be understood&#10;better.&#10;&#10;We have shown that the exact characterization of the patterns in the&#10;F-lattice on a checkerboard background reduces to solving a discrete&#10;Laplace equation on the adjacency graph of the pattern. For the single&#10;source pattern this graph is a square grid on a two-sheeted Riemann&#10;surface and in the presence of a line sink it is on a three-sheeted&#10;Riemann surface. This Riemann surface structure occurs for other sink&#10;geometries as well and the number of sheets can be determined from the&#10;way diverges near the origin.&#10;&#10;If the potential diverges as near the origin, then the corresponding&#10;complex function . Then . In all the cases studied above, the patch to&#10;which point belongs is characterized by integers , where . Also .&#10;Writing , and , we see that . This then gives the number of Riemann&#10;sheets. For example, for the wedge angle , we have . Then , and the&#10;Riemann surface would have 5 sheets.&#10;&#10;The patterns discussed so far in this chapter have only two types of&#10;patches with densities and . But it is possible to have patterns with&#10;patches of other densities. For example, for the patterns with two&#10;sources, even a slight deviation of the position of the second source in&#10;Fig.\[fig:twosource\] from the x-axis introduces patches which have&#10;areal density different from or . One such pattern produced by adding&#10;grains each at and is shown in Fig.\[fig:distr\]. The regions with&#10;stripes of red and yellow are patches of the new density. In addition,&#10;the boundaries of these patches have slopes other than , and . Most of&#10;the analysis presented here is appilcable to this pattern, except that&#10;the matching conditions along the common boundary between two patches&#10;and the adjacency graph are different.&#10;&#10;The cases in which the full pattern can be explicitly determined are&#10;clearly special. For example, one of the conditions used for the exact&#10;characterization of the patterns in this chapter is that inside each&#10;patch the height variables are periodic and hence is constant. It is&#10;easy to check that this condition is not met for most sink geometries.&#10;For example, patterns of the type discussed in Section with any other&#10;than integer multiples of have aperiodic patches. In such cases, the&#10;present treatment for characterization of patterns is clearly not&#10;applicable. However, the scaling analysis for the growth of the spatial&#10;lengths in the pattern with is still valid.&#10;&#10;The function satisfies the discrete Cauchy-Riemann condition (equation&#10;(\[cr\])). These functions are known as discrete holomorphic functions&#10;in the mathematics literature. Usually they have been studied for a&#10;square grid of points on the plane . While more general discretizations&#10;of the plane have been discussed , not much is known about the behavior&#10;of such functions for multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces. A perturbative&#10;approach of determining these functions for square discretization of&#10;multi-sheeted Riemann surface is presented in the Appendix&#10;\[apndx:dhf\].&#10;&#10;In our analysis we have also used the fact that the patterns have&#10;nonzero average overall excess density ( i.e. in Eq. (\[nr3\]) is&#10;nonzero). The case is quite different, and requires a substantially&#10;different treatment. We discuss such patterns in the next chapter.">

<outline text="Pattern Formation in Fast-Growing Sandpiles" _note="BASED ON THE PAPER by Tridib Sadhu and Deepak Dhar.&#10;&#10;We study the patterns formed by adding sand-grains at a single site on&#10;an initial periodic background in the Abelian sandpile models, and&#10;relaxing the configuration.

  <outline text="Introduction" _note="In the last two chapters, we studied the patterns produced by adding&#10;grains at a single site in a Deterministic Abelian Sandpile Model&#10;(DASM), and relaxing. A complete relaxation process, starting from the&#10;addition of sand to reaching the final stable configuration is called an&#10;avalanche. The length of an avalanche depends on the initial height&#10;configuration, I E., the background. For some backgrounds on an infinite&#10;lattice, topplings may continue for ever, and the avalanches reach to&#10;infinity. For other backgrounds, where the avalanches are finite, the&#10;toppled sites form patterns in the spatial configuration of sites with&#10;different values of the height variables.&#10;&#10;The backgrounds leading to infinite avalanches have been termed as&#10;EXPLOSIVE.&#10;&#10;In the other backgrounds with finite avalanches the diameter of the&#10;pattern usually grows as with increasing number of added grains in&#10;dimensions. We call this type of growth as COMPACT growth. All the&#10;patterns studied so far showed compact growth. In this chapter, we&#10;describe a remarkable class of patterns where the diameter remains&#10;finite for any finite , but grows as , with . We call this type of&#10;growth as NON-COMPACT growth. Characterization of these patterns, as&#10;will be shown, is simpler than the ones with compact growth.&#10;&#10;For a sandpile model with stochastic toppling rule, the size of the&#10;pattern is determined only by the density of heights in the background,&#10;and the specific arrangement of heights does not matter. There exist a&#10;critical density , depending on the toppling rules, such that, on a&#10;background with sub-critical density , finite avalanches occur with&#10;probability . The corresponding asymptotic pattern is a simple circle,&#10;with density , inside, and the diameter of the circle growing as . For&#10;densities , probability of finite avalanches vanishes in the large&#10;limit.&#10;&#10;For a deterministic sandpile a similar critical density can not be&#10;defined. One can construct backgrounds with densities very close to&#10;zero, and still there are infinite avalanches. A simple example of such&#10;backgrounds, on any lattice, is the one where the sites with height form&#10;an infinite connected cluster, with being the threshold height. Height&#10;at other sites could be zero, and thus the density of the background&#10;could be made very small. On the other hand, it is possible to construct&#10;backgrounds with mean density arbitrarily close to , and yet the&#10;avalanches are always finite \[explosion\]. Absence of an infinite&#10;avalanche depends on the detailed arrangement of heights in the&#10;background, and not on the density alone.&#10;&#10;There are some earlier work on the growth rate of the sandpile patterns.&#10;Some backgrounds of both types, explosive and non-explosive, for a&#10;deterministic ASM were studied in . In all the examples, studied so far,&#10;the background is either explosive or the growth of the patterns is&#10;compact. For a deterministic ASM on a square lattice, it was shown ,&#10;that the pattern produced on a background of constant height , is always&#10;enclosed inside a square whose width grows as . Given the absence of any&#10;critical density, it is non-trivial to find a background on which the&#10;patterns grow with a rate faster than , but finite. In fact, for the&#10;sandpile models on a standard square lattice there are no known examples&#10;of patterns with non-compact growth.&#10;&#10;We found two classes of backgrounds, both infinite, on a directed&#10;triangular lattice (see Fig. \[fig:trilattice\]), for which the growth&#10;is proportionate, with the growth exponent . Examples of these classes&#10;of backgrounds and patterns formed on them are shown in Fig.&#10;\[fig:tribg\], Fig. \[fig:hex\] and Fig. \[fig:tri\]. Our numerical&#10;study shows, but we have no formal proof, that different backgrounds&#10;belonging to the same class produce the same asymptotic pattern. In&#10;addition, we found infinitely many backgrounds on the F-lattice which&#10;produce patterns with proportionate non-compact growth. However, in&#10;these cases the growth exponent takes a different value, with for each&#10;member.&#10;&#10;We also discuss the exact characterization of the pattern shown in Fig.&#10;\[fig:hex\], one of the two asymptotic patterns we have found with .&#10;This is described, as in the earlier studied case of compact growth (see&#10;previous chapters), in terms of the scaled toppling function. However,&#10;the analysis of non-compact patterns is actually simpler. Clearly, for ,&#10;the mean excess density of particles in the toppled region is zero, in&#10;the asymptotic patterns. Infact, the patterns are made of large patches&#10;where heights are periodic, and inside each patch, the mean density is&#10;exactly the same as in the background, and the excess grains are&#10;concentrated along the patch boundaries. There are also some boundaries&#10;where excess grains density is negative. We show that this leads to the&#10;scaled toppling function being a piece-wise linear function of the&#10;rescaled coordinates. Thus, in each patch, the potential function is&#10;specified by only three coefficients. In contrast, for the compact&#10;patterns discussed in chapters \[ch2\] and \[ch3\], the scaled toppling&#10;function is a quadratic function of the coordinates in each patch, and&#10;one has to determine six coefficients for each patch, to determine the&#10;function fully.&#10;&#10;We are able to reduce the problem of determining the asymptotic pattern&#10;in Fig. \[fig:hex\] to that of finding the lattice Green’s function on a&#10;hexagonal lattice. This is known to be expressible as integrals that can&#10;be evaluated in closed form (see Appendix \[ap:laplace\]), and this&#10;leads to a full solution of the problem. This is in contrast to the&#10;characterization of the compact growth patterns in previous chapters,&#10;where one requires solution of Discrete Laplace’s equation on a square&#10;grid on Riemann surfaces of multiple sheets, and there are no known&#10;closed form expression for the solution.&#10;&#10;This chapter is organized as follows: In section \[sec:cnc\], we&#10;discuss, in details, how different periodic background configurations&#10;give rise to different rates of growth. In section \[sec:enc\] we define&#10;a deterministic ASM on the directed triangular lattice, and describe the&#10;two classes of periodic backgrounds that produces patterns with&#10;non-compact growth. In section \[sec:pwl\] we argue that, for any&#10;pattern with non-compact proportionate growth the rescaled toppling&#10;function is piece-wise linear. In section \[sec:anc\], we discuss exact&#10;characterization of the simplest of the non-compact growth patterns with&#10;. Patterns on the F-lattice, with are discussed in section \[sec:ncfl\].&#10;The section \[sec:tropical\] contains some discussion about connection&#10;to tropical polynomials.">

  <outline text="Compact and non-compact growth" _note="The simplest growing patterns are found in the Manna-type sandpile&#10;models with stochastic toppling rules . In these models, when the&#10;density of particles in the background is small, the avalanches are&#10;always finite. In the relaxed configuration, the toppled sites form a&#10;nearly circular region (see Fig. \[fig:mannapattern\]). The asymptotic&#10;pattern seems to be perfectly circular disc of uniform density, with an&#10;average density inside the circle and outside. The value of is&#10;independent of the background density , and is equal to the unique&#10;steady state density of the corresponding self organized critical model&#10;with random sites of addition, and dissipation at the boundary . The&#10;region inside the circle forgets about the initial height configuration,&#10;and is in the self-organized critical state. The boundary of the&#10;affected region is thin with a sharp transition of density from to (see&#10;Fig. \[fig:transition\]). Then considering that, for large , all the&#10;added grains are confined inside the circular region of diameter , we&#10;get Thus the pattern has a compact growth.&#10;&#10;For densities close to, but below , sometimes a single particle addition&#10;can lead to very large increase in the size of the toppled region.&#10;However, probability of such large jumps decreases exponentially with&#10;size, and for any finite , with probability , avalanches remain finite.&#10;As long as is less than , the system relaxes, forming a pattern whose&#10;diameter grows as . Adding a single grain on a background of&#10;super-critical density () gives rise to infinite avalanches, with&#10;non-zero probability. Then, with probability , such backgrounds will&#10;lead to an infinite avalanche for some finite value of . In higher&#10;dimensions also, a similar behavior is expected.&#10;&#10;At the probability of large avalanches has a power law tail, and the&#10;above argument does not apply. It may be possible to construct a robust&#10;background with critical density of heights. However, no such example&#10;has been found, so far.&#10;&#10;In the models with deterministic relaxation rules there is no well&#10;defined critical density , separating the explosive and non-explosive&#10;backgrounds. The geometry of height distribution plays the determining&#10;role in the robustness of a background.&#10;&#10;In the deterministic models, similar circular pattern is produced for a&#10;background with random assignment of heights per site, of small average&#10;density . Inside the pattern, density of heights is which is the steady&#10;state density of the corresponding SOC model. However, on a background&#10;of higher densities, this picture is changed considerably. For example&#10;consider the BTW model on a square lattice, where the steady state&#10;density . It has been shown that a background with a random assignment&#10;of height with probability , on a sea of constant height is explosive,&#10;even for arbitrary small value of , although the average density is much&#10;less than .&#10;&#10;For a background with periodic heights, it is possible to construct&#10;explosive backgrounds of any density, even with arbitrary small values.&#10;As an example, we consider the BTW model on an infinite square lattice.&#10;Define a background made of square unit cells of width with empty sites&#10;inside the cell, and grains at each site in the boundary. For , the&#10;average density . If any of the occupied site receives a grain, it&#10;starts a chain of toppling events where all the occupied sites topple,&#10;and the avalanche reaches infinity.&#10;&#10;On the other hand a constant background of height at all sites is a&#10;minimally stable configuration I.E, addition of a single grain will&#10;produce an infinite avalanche. Still, it is possible to construct a&#10;robust background with density arbitrarily close to . For example,&#10;consider the background in the previous example, and exchange the height&#10;variables: make the occupied sites empty, and fill the empty sites with&#10;grains. It has been shown , that this background is stable and the&#10;pattern produced has a compact growth.&#10;&#10;We will show in the next section that, there is a large class of&#10;backgrounds, with a range of densities, for which the growth is less&#10;than explosive, but more than compact.">

  <outline text="Examples of non-compact growth" _note="We first discuss the patterns with . We start with an ASM on a directed&#10;graph corresponding to an infinite two dimensional triangular lattice,&#10;with each site having three incoming and three outgoing arrows (see Fig.&#10;\[fig:trilattice\]). The threshold height , for each site. If the height&#10;at any site is above or equal to , it is unstable, and relaxes by&#10;toppling: in each toppling, three sand grains leave the unstable site,&#10;and are transferred one each along the directed bonds going out of the&#10;site.&#10;&#10;We consider two classes of backgrounds on this lattice:&#10;&#10;We consider the lattice as made of triangular plaquettes, which are&#10;joined together to make tiles in the shape of regular hexagons with&#10;edges of length . We cover the two-dimensional plane with these tiles.&#10;Sites that lie on the boundaries of these hexagons are assigned height ,&#10;and the rest of the sites have height . Figure \[fig:tribg\] shows the&#10;background configuration for the case .&#10;&#10;For these backgrounds, we cover the two-dimensional plane with tiles in&#10;the shape of equilateral triangles of edge-length . The sites that lie&#10;on the boundaries of the triangles, and are shared by two triangles, are&#10;assigned height , and remaining sites are assigned height . Sites that&#10;are at the corners of triangular tiles, and shared by six of them, are&#10;also assigned heights . The background configuration corresponding to is&#10;shown in figure \[fig:tribg\]. The pattern made of triangular tiles with&#10;is same as the class I background with hexagon of edge-length . Hence,&#10;only patterns formed with triangles of edge-length will be said to be in&#10;this class.&#10;&#10;The patterns produced by adding grains, where is large, at a single site&#10;on the two backgrounds in Fig. \[fig:tribg\] are shown in Fig.&#10;\[fig:hex\] and \[fig:tri\]. While the patterns look quite similar, a&#10;closer examination shows that they are not identical. In Fig.&#10;\[fig:tri\], there are extra lines of particles within the brownish&#10;patches which break each patch into smaller parts. In fact, with the&#10;identification of some patches having only a point in common, as&#10;discussed later, we can show that each patch breaks into exactly three&#10;patches. These three parts have similar periodic pattern, but with&#10;different orientations.&#10;&#10;\&#10;&#10;This differences can be seen more clearly in terms of the net excess&#10;change in height in a unit cell centered at , where the unit cell is&#10;that of the background pattern. where is the change in height at site .&#10;For example in the first background in Fig. \[fig:tribg\] a unit cell is&#10;a hexagon of edge length , and for the second background it is a&#10;parallelogram of each side length . A site that is on the edge of the&#10;unit cell is counted with weight , and a site on the corner of the&#10;hexagon with weight , and on the corner of the parallelogram with weight&#10;. By construction, the function is zero inside each patch, and non-zero&#10;along the boundaries between patches. The patterns in terms of these&#10;variables, corresponding to those in Fig. \[fig:hex\] and \[fig:tri\]&#10;are shown in Fig. \[fig:line\].&#10;&#10;We have seen that the patterns on these two classes of backgrounds&#10;exhibit proportionate growth, I.E., all the spatial features inside the&#10;patterns for large , grow at the same rate with the diameter. We define&#10;the diameter , in general, for any pattern in this paper, as the height&#10;of the smallest rectangle containing it. For the patterns in Fig.&#10;\[fig:hex\] and Fig. \[fig:tri\], it is then the length of a side of the&#10;bounding equilateral triangle. This particular choice makes as an&#10;integer multiple of , on the triangular lattice. We find that for both&#10;types of backgrounds in Fig. \[fig:tribg\], the diameter of the pattern&#10;grows linearly with (Fig. \[fig:triln\]).">

  <outline text="Piece-wise linearity of the toppling function[sec:pwl]" _note="Considering the proportionate growth, let us define a rescaled&#10;coordinate , where is the position vector of a site on the lattice. The&#10;number of topplings at any site inside the pattern, scales linearly with&#10;. Let us define We now show, using an extension of the argument given in&#10;chapter \[ch2\], that the function is linear inside periodic patches in&#10;all the patterns with non-compact growth, I.E., with . Within a patch,&#10;the function is expandable in Taylor series around any point , not on&#10;the boundary of the patch. Defining , and we have Consider any term of&#10;order in the expansion, for example, the term . This can only arise due&#10;to a term in the toppling function . Then, considering the fact that is&#10;an integer function of and , it is easy to see that this term would lead&#10;to discontinuous changes in at intervals of . As for non-compact growth&#10;patterns, this leads to a change in the periodicity of heights at such&#10;intervals inside each patch which themselves are of size . This would&#10;then result in many defect lines within a patch, in the pattern at large&#10;. However there are no such features in Fig. \[fig:hexpicl1\]. Therefore&#10;inside each periodic patch, must be exactly linear in . In fact, it&#10;turns out that the integer toppling function is exactly linear inside a&#10;patch even for any finite , except for an additional periodic term of&#10;periodicity equal to that of the heights inside the patch.&#10;&#10;Another consequence of the exact linearity of the potential function in&#10;each patch is that all patch boundaries in the asymptotic pattern are&#10;straight lines.&#10;&#10;The argument finally relies on the two observed (not rigorously&#10;established) features of the patterns, I.E., there is proportionate&#10;growth, and that the patterns can be decomposed in terms of periodic&#10;patches which are themselves of size .&#10;&#10;Let us write the toppling function within a single patch as where is a&#10;periodic function of its argument with zero mean value. If and are the&#10;basis vectors at the unit cell of the periodic pattern then we have&#10;&#10;As are integer valued functions, and can only take integer values. If&#10;and are the unit vectors in the reciprocal space of the super lattice of&#10;the periodic pattern, then must be an integer linear combination of and&#10;, and can be written as where and are some integers. For example, in the&#10;background pattern in Fig. \[fig:bkg0\], a choice of the basis vectors&#10;and its reciprocal vectors is The fact that is constant inside a patch,&#10;implies that the patches can be labeled by the pair of integers .&#10;&#10;An interesting consequence of this linear dependence of is that there&#10;are no transient structures within the patches. On increasing , if the&#10;function increases, all sites in the patch , except possibly those at&#10;the patch boundaries, undergo same number of additional topplings.">

  <outline text="Characterizing the class  asymptotic patterns[sec:anc]" _note="We now discuss characterization of the asymptotic pattern of class I,&#10;showing . In this section we quantitatively characterize the asymptotic&#10;pattern for the case . The background configuration is shown in Fig.&#10;\[fig:bkg0\]. A site on the triangular lattice can be labeled uniquely&#10;by a pair of integers , such that its position on a complex plane can be&#10;written as , where is a complex cube root of unity. Then, the height&#10;variables in the background pattern in Fig. \[fig:bkg0\], can be written&#10;as The average height in the background, . The configuration of the pile&#10;produced on this background, by adding grains at the origin is shown in&#10;Fig. \[fig:hexpicl1\].&#10;&#10;We see that the sites toppled due to addition of the grains are confined&#10;within an equilateral triangle. The pattern can be thought of as a union&#10;of patches, inside which the heights are periodic. A zoom-in showing the&#10;height configuration with five patches meeting at a point is shown in&#10;Fig. \[boundary\]. There are only two types of periodic patches seen:&#10;one is like the background, where the sites of height are surrounded by&#10;sites of height , and the other with heights surrounded by heights .&#10;Then, the average height inside both types of patches are same. In fact,&#10;it is equal to that of the background, .&#10;&#10;The patches in the outer region of the pattern are big, and they become&#10;smaller, and more numerous as we go inwards. Along the common boundary&#10;of adjacent patches, we see line-like defect structures, and only along&#10;these lines the density is different from the background. In Fig.&#10;\[boundary\], one can also see the periodicity of the structures along&#10;the patch boundaries. Some patch boundaries, like the horizontal&#10;boundary in Fig. \[boundary\], have a deficit of particles compared to&#10;the background.&#10;&#10;The boundaries of the patches are seen more clearly in terms of&#10;variables, as shown in figure \[fig:line\](a), where we have labelled&#10;different patches as ETC..&#10;&#10;. \[jump\]&#10;&#10;The dependence of on for this background is shown in Fig. \[fig:triln\].&#10;We see that the diameter for the pattern grows asymptotically linearly&#10;with , but it grows in bursts: it remains constant for a long interval&#10;as more and more grains are added, and suddenly increases by a large&#10;amount at certain values of . For example, at , the is , and it jumps to&#10;a value when one more grain is added. Let denote the size of the maximum&#10;jump in encountered, as is varied from to . In Fig. \[jump\], we have&#10;plotted the variation of with . The graph is consistent with a power-law&#10;growth, with a power around . Thus the fractional size of the bursts&#10;decreases for large .&#10;&#10;We define scaled complex coordinates , where is the complex coordinate&#10;of the site . We define the rescaled toppling function for this pattern&#10;as Then it is easy to see that is equal to the mean flux of particles at&#10;. If we consider a small line element , then the net flux of particles&#10;across the line equals . Then, the conservation of sand grains implies&#10;that the toppling function satisfies the equation where is the&#10;finite-difference operator on the lattice, corresponding to the&#10;Laplacian . It is easy to see that this implies that the scaled&#10;potential function satisfies the Poisson equation where is the areal&#10;density of excess grains at . It is related to , the mean excess grain&#10;density [PER SITE]{} by&#10;&#10;The piece-wise linearity of simplifies the analysis of the pattern,&#10;significantly. The potential function can be characterized by only three&#10;parameters. Using Eq. (\[eq:recp1\]), (\[eq:recp\]) and (\[eq:rscT\]),&#10;for each patch , we can find a pair of integers such that the potential&#10;in patch is characterized by where and is a real number, constant&#10;everywhere inside the patch. Here denotes the complex conjugate of .&#10;&#10;Each patch is characterized by a complex number which is the coefficient&#10;in the potential function of the patch. In the complex -plane, each&#10;patch with labels as in Fig. \[fig:line\](a) can then be represented by&#10;a point. We connect two patches by a line if they share a common&#10;boundary. Then the resulting figure, shown in Fig. \[adjhex\], is the&#10;adjacency graph of the patches.&#10;&#10;We can determine the connectivity structure of this graph, without&#10;knowing the full potential function in each patch. We first take&#10;transformation of the pattern. This is shown in Fig. \[fig:1byz\]. Some&#10;of the bigger patches are denoted by capital alphabets in Fig.&#10;\[fig:line\](a) and their corresponding patches on the transformed&#10;pattern in Fig. \[fig:1byz\]. The patches and in Fig. \[fig:line\](a)&#10;are adjacent to the outer region through the same vertical boundary.&#10;Matching the values of the function and fixing the discontinuity in its&#10;normal derivatives at the boundary, it is easy to see that has the same&#10;functional form in the patches and . In fact, it is convenient to&#10;imagine that the boundary between and moved to the right by an&#10;infinitesimal amount, so that it does not touch the patches and , and&#10;then and would actually join to form a single connected patch . We thus&#10;consider and as one patch, and both can be represented as one point on&#10;the -plane. Similarly, we identify and , and , ETC. Then the adjacency&#10;graph can be constructed by joining the sites on the -plane, according&#10;to the adjacency of patches in Fig. \[fig:1byz\].&#10;&#10;It turns out that the patches corresponding to mod do not appear in the&#10;pattern, and the adjacency graph, as shown in Fig. \[adjhex\], is a&#10;hexagonal lattice with some extra edges shown in brown color. These&#10;extra edges connect all the vertices at same distance from the origin&#10;(in the metric), and also connect some of the diagonally opposite sites&#10;on the rectangular faces of the graph as shown in figure.&#10;&#10;The charge density is zero inside the patches, and the excess grains due&#10;to addition are distributed along the patch boundaries, leading to&#10;nonzero line charge densities separating neighboring patches. Then the&#10;density function is a superposition of the line charge densities along&#10;the patch boundaries. There are three kinds of line charges of charge&#10;density , , and .&#10;&#10;From the electrostatic analogy, it is seen that is continuous across the&#10;common boundary between neighboring patches, and its normal derivative&#10;is discontinuous by an amount equal to the line charge density along the&#10;boundary. Let and be the two neighboring patches with the equation of&#10;the boundary between them such that the patch is on the left of the&#10;boundary. Then using the continuity condition, it is easy to show that&#10;where is the complex conjugate of . We note that, there are only six&#10;different types of patch boundaries in the pattern, with angle an&#10;integer multiple of .&#10;&#10;It is easy to check that the matching conditions along the edges of&#10;hexagonal lattice (denoted by blue solid line in Fig. \[adjhex\]) are&#10;sufficient to determine for all the vertices. The line charge density&#10;for the patch boundaries corresponding to these edges. Also, the&#10;potential function , for the vertex at the origin, and hence, and both&#10;vanishes. Then using the matching condition, it is easy to check that,&#10;the values of are consistent with the form in Eq. (\[eq:Dunn\]).&#10;&#10;The function satisfies the discrete Laplace’s equation on the underlying&#10;hexagonal lattice of the adjacency graph I.E. where denotes the three&#10;neighbors of the vertex on the hexagonal lattice. This can be checked&#10;from the concurrency condition of patch boundaries. For example consider&#10;the edges , and on the adjacency graph. The corresponding patch&#10;boundaries in the pattern intersect at the same point (Fig.&#10;\[fig:line\](a)). Then it is easy to check using the matching condition&#10;in Eq.(\[eq:bc\]) that, Similar equations hold for the other vertices.&#10;&#10;In the region outside the pattern, where none of the sites toppled, the&#10;potential function . This corresponds to , and . The solution of the&#10;Laplace’s equation with the above boundary condition can be written in&#10;the following integral form for (mod ), where is a normalizing constant,&#10;which determines the pattern up to a scale factor. For the sites with&#10;(mod ), are the average of those corresponding to the neighboring sites.&#10;As an example the potential function in region , and is where , and .&#10;Then the equation of the patch boundary between patches and is and that&#10;of the boundary between patches and is Equivalently, the length of an&#10;edge of the bounding equilateral triangle of the pattern is equal to ,&#10;for large .&#10;&#10;The constant in Eq. (\[solution\]) can be calculated using the form of&#10;the potential function near the site of addition. As noted, the function&#10;can be considered as the potential due to line charges along the patch&#10;boundaries and a point charge of unit amount at the origin. Then, close&#10;to the origin the solution diverges logarithmically as , and the&#10;potential function is an approximation to this solution by a piece-wise&#10;linear function. Then, there are coordinates inside each patch with&#10;large, where the and its first derivatives are equal to and its first&#10;derivatives, respectively. Then, The above two equations imply for&#10;large. Comparing it with the Eq. (\[solution\]) for large we find that&#10;the numerical constant . This determines the potential function&#10;completely, and thus characterizes the pattern. For example, as in&#10;figure \[fig:line\](a), the equation of the rightmost boundary of the&#10;pattern, using Eq. (\[eq:aob\]) is . Equations of other boundaries of&#10;patches can be calculated similarly. For example, the reduced&#10;coordinates of the point where the patches and meet in Fig.&#10;\[fig:line\](a), is determined by the condition that it is a common&#10;point of patches , and , and that the function is continuous. Then using&#10;the values , , and we get the reduced coordinates of this point as&#10;&#10;Equivalently, the height of the bounding equilateral triangle increases&#10;as . The estimated slope of the fitting line in Fig. \[fig:triln\] is&#10;1.1, in reasonable agreement with the theory. However, even though the&#10;exact function has large fluctuations of number theoretic origin, the&#10;estimated slope is noticeably lower than the calculated asymptotic&#10;value. To examine this discrepancy closer, we have plotted in Fig.&#10;\[fig:diffdia\] the discrepancy as a function of . We find that this&#10;appears to increase with as , for large . The reason for this behavior&#10;is not understood yet.&#10;&#10;For backgrounds, with , our numerical results suggest that there is a&#10;crossover length , and initially, for , the avalanches grow&#10;“explosively&quot; in size. As a result, the number of particles inside a&#10;disc of radius in the final pattern is less than that in the initial&#10;background. The net flux of particles going out of the disc increases&#10;with until the radius becomes of order . After this, the large-scale&#10;properties of the pattern are the same as that of pattern, with the&#10;number of particles added , where is an -dependent constant. In&#10;particular, the size of the pattern is -times the size of the pattern&#10;for with same . The crossover length is expected to grows as .&#10;&#10;For a background with , the basis vectors at the unit cell are and ,&#10;where , are the basis vectors for background (see Eq.

  <outline text="Summary and concluding remarks[sec:tropical]" _note="In this chapter, we have studied two dimensional patterns formed in&#10;Abelian sandpile models by adding particles at one site on an initial&#10;periodic background, where the diameter of the pattern grows as , with .&#10;Using some features observed in the pattern of adjacency of patches as&#10;an input, we are able to determine the exact asymptotic pattern in the&#10;specific case with , on a class background.&#10;&#10;The patterns on class backgrounds can also be characterized similarly.&#10;As noted earlier, some of the patches split into smaller parts. By using&#10;the transformation, we can again determine the structure of the&#10;adjacency graph. The graph for the pattern in Fig. \[fig:line\](b) is&#10;shown in Fig. \[fig:adjtwo\]. It is a periodic lattice where half of the&#10;vertices of the hexagonal lattice are replaced by vertices (colored in&#10;brown). The exact D-values for different patches can be easily&#10;determined. The determination of for this pattern then requires the&#10;solution of the Laplace’s equation on this graph. It can be shown that a&#10;slight alteration of the graph, by drawing the missing edges in the&#10;small triangles shown in pink colors, does not change the pattern. Then&#10;the solution of the Laplace’s equation can be reduced to the solution of&#10;a resistor network on this modified graph. The later can be further&#10;reduced to the resistor network on a hexagonal lattice, discussed by&#10;Atkinson ET.AL. , using the well-known transformation. We present the&#10;analysis in the Appendix \[apndx:laplace\].&#10;&#10;An important feature of the non-compact patterns is that, it can be&#10;characterized by a piece-wise linear function. This characterization is&#10;simpler than that of the patterns with compact growth, where one&#10;requires piece-wise quadratic polynomials. We have shown that there are&#10;infinitely many backgrounds, on which the patterns have non-compact&#10;growth. It would be desirable to determine the exact value of for&#10;different backgrounds showing non-compact growth studied in section&#10;\[sec:ncfl\].&#10;&#10;Another interesting question is a possible connection of this problem to&#10;tropical algebra . In tropical mathematics, one defines operations&#10;similar to ‘addition’ and ‘multiplication’ (denoted by and here) by&#10;where , are real parameters. Familiar properties of addition and&#10;multiplication operators, like commutativity, associativity, existence&#10;of identity, distributive property continues to hold in the new&#10;definition. One can then define polynomials in several variables. The&#10;graph of a tropical polynomial is a piecewise linear function which is&#10;also convex. For example, consider the tropical function In terms of&#10;standard algebra The graph corresponding to this function is shown in&#10;Fig. \[fig:trop\]&#10;&#10;We note that for the pattern discussed in section , the potential&#10;function is piece-wise linear. It seems plausible that tropical&#10;polynomials may be useful to describe this function. In fact, tropical&#10;geometry have been discussed as possibly related to sandpile models .&#10;For small values of , our numerical study showed that is convex, if&#10;restricted to one sextant. However, for larger , as shown in Fig.&#10;\[surfaceplot\], we see that is not convex even within one sextant.&#10;&#10;We conclude that it is not possible to represent the potential as a&#10;simple tropical polynomial.">

<outline text="A continuous height sandpile model" _note="BASED ON THE PAPER by Tridib Sadhu and Deepak Dhar.&#10;&#10;In this chapter, we study the Zhang model of sandpile, defined in the&#10;first chapter, on a one dimensional chain of length , driven by adding a&#10;random amount of height at a randomly chosen site at each addition step.&#10;We show that in spite of this randomness in the input height, the&#10;probability distribution function of height at a site in the steady&#10;state is sharply peaked, and the width of the peak decreases as for&#10;large .&#10;&#10;We also discuss how the height added at one time is distributed among&#10;different sites by topplings with time. We relate this distribution to&#10;the time-dependent probability distribution of the position of a marked&#10;grain in the one dimensional abelian model with discrete heights. We&#10;argue that in the large limit, the variance of height at site has a&#10;scaling form , where varies as for small , which agrees well with the&#10;results from numerical simulations.">
  <outline text="Introduction" _note="After Dhar first discovered the abelian property of the BTW model , many&#10;more models in the general class known as abelian distributed&#10;processors, were studied, as the abelian property makes their&#10;theoretical study simpler . The original sandpile model of Bak ET AL. ,&#10;the Eulerian walkers model , and the abelian variant of the model&#10;originally proposed by Manna are all members of this class. Models which&#10;do not have the abelian property have been studied mostly by numerical&#10;simulations. As discussed in chapter \[ch:intro\], the Zhang model is&#10;one such model, and this is what we study in this chapter.&#10;&#10;In the Zhang model, the amount of height added at a randomly chosen site&#10;at each addition step is not fixed, but random. In spite of this, the&#10;model in one dimension has the remarkable property that the height at a&#10;site in the steady state has a very sharply peaked distribution in which&#10;the width of the peak is much less than the spread in the input amount&#10;per time step, and the width decreases with increasing system size .&#10;This behavior was noticed by Zhang using numerical simulations in one&#10;and two dimension , and he called it the ‘emergence of quasi-units’ in&#10;the steady state of the model. He argued that for large systems, the&#10;behavior would be same as in the discrete model. Recently, A. Fey ET AL.&#10;have proved that for some choices of the distribution of input height,&#10;in one dimension, the variance of height does go to zero as the length&#10;of the chain goes to infinity. However, they did not study how fast the&#10;variance decreases with .&#10;&#10;We study this emergence of ‘quasi-units’ in one dimensional Zhang&#10;sandpile by looking at how the added height is redistributed among&#10;different sites in the avalanche process. We show that the distribution&#10;function of the fraction of height, added at a site , reaching a site&#10;after time steps following the addition is exactly equal to the&#10;probability distribution that a marked grain in the one-dimensional&#10;height type BTW model added at site , reaches site in time . The latter&#10;problem was studied earlier . We use this to show that the variance of&#10;height asymptotically vanishes as . We also discuss the spatial&#10;dependence of the variance along the system length. In the large limit,&#10;the variance at site has a scaling form . We determine an approximate&#10;form of the scaling function , which agrees very well with the results&#10;of our numerical simulations.&#10;&#10;There have been other studies of the Zhang model earlier. Blanchard ET&#10;AL. have studied the steady state of the model where the amount of&#10;addition of height is fixed but the site of addition is chosen randomly,&#10;and found that the distribution of energies even for the two site&#10;problem is very complicated, and has a multi-fractal character. In two&#10;dimensions, the distribution of height seems to sharpen for larger , but&#10;the rate of decrease of the width is very slow . Most other studies have&#10;dealt with the question as to whether the critical exponents of the&#10;avalanche distribution in this model are the same as in the discrete&#10;abelian model . A. Fey ET AL.’s results imply that the asymptotic&#10;behavior of the avalanche distribution in one dimension, for specific&#10;cases, is identical to the discrete case, but the situation in higher&#10;dimension remains unclear .&#10;&#10;The plan of the chapter is as follows. In Section \[ch4.2\], we define&#10;the model precisely. In Section \[ch4.3\], we show that the way the&#10;height added at a site is distributed among different sites by toppling&#10;is same as the time-dependent probability distribution of the position&#10;of a marked grain in the discrete abelian sandpile model. This&#10;correspondence is used in Section \[ch4.4\] to determine the qualitative&#10;dependence of the variance of the height variable at a site on its&#10;position , and on the system size . We propose a simple extrapolation&#10;form that incorporates this dependence. We check our theoretical&#10;arguments with numerical simulations in Section \[ch4.5\]. Section&#10;\[ch4.6\] contains a summary and concluding remarks. A detailed&#10;calculation of the solution of an equation, required in Section&#10;\[ch4.4\], is given in the Appendix \[apndx:zhang\].">

  <outline text="Definition and preliminaries" _note="We consider our model on a linear chain of size . The sites are labelled&#10;by integers to and a real continuous height variable is assigned to each&#10;site. Let be the height variable at site at the [END]{} of the time-step&#10;. We define a threshold height value , same for each site, and sites&#10;with are called unstable, while those with are called stable. Starting&#10;from a configuration where all sites are stable, the dynamics is defined&#10;as follows.&#10;&#10;\(i) The system is driven by adding a random amount of height at the&#10;BEGINNING of every time-step at a randomly chosen site. Let the amount&#10;of height added at time be . We will assume that all ’s are independent,&#10;identically distributed random variables, each picked randomly from an&#10;uniform interval . Let the site of addition chosen at time be denoted by&#10;.&#10;&#10;\(ii) We make a list of all sites whose height exceeds or becomes equal&#10;to the critical value . All these sites are relaxed in parallel by&#10;topplings. In a toppling, the height of the site is equally distributed&#10;to its two neighbors and the height at that site is reset to zero. If&#10;there is toppling at a boundary site, half of the height at that site&#10;before toppling is lost.&#10;&#10;\(iii) We iterate Step (ii) until all topplings stop. This completes one&#10;time step.&#10;&#10;This is the slow driving limit, and we have assumed that all avalanche&#10;activity stops before the next addition event. In this limit, the model&#10;is characterized by two parameters and . In the limit , and , the model&#10;reduces to the discrete case, where the behavior is well understood .&#10;For non-zero but small , the behavior does not depend on the precise&#10;value of . In fact, starting with a recurrent configuration of the pile,&#10;and adding height at some chosen site, we get exactly the same sequence&#10;of topplings for a range of values of . To be precise, for any fixed&#10;initial configuration, and fixed driving sequence (of sites chosen for&#10;addition of height), whether a site topples at time or not is&#10;independent of , so long as we have . In the following, we assume for&#10;simplicity that , and .&#10;&#10;It was shown in that in this case, the stationary state has at most one&#10;site with height and all other sites have height in the range . The&#10;position of the empty site is equally distributed among all the lattice&#10;points. There are also some recurrent configurations in which all sites&#10;have height . In such cases, we shall say that the site with zero height&#10;is the site . Then, in the steady state, there is exactly one site with&#10;height equal to , and the different positions of the site are equally&#10;likely.&#10;&#10;If does not satisfy the inequality , this simple characterization of the&#10;steady state is no longer valid. However, our treatment can be easily&#10;extended to those cases. Since the qualitative behavior of the model is&#10;the same in all cases, we restrict ourselves to the simplest case here.&#10;&#10;It is easy to see that the toppling rules are in general not abelian.&#10;For example, start with a two site model in configuration and . The&#10;final configuration would be , or , depending on whether the first or&#10;the second site is toppled initially. In our model, using the parallel&#10;update rule, the final configuration would be . A. Fey ET AL. have shown&#10;that only in one dimension, for , the Zhang model has a restricted&#10;abelian character, namely, that the final state does not depend on the&#10;order of topplings within an avalanche. However, topplings in two&#10;different avalanches do not commute.">

  <outline text="The propagator, and its relation to the discrete abelian model" _note="It is useful to look at the Zhang model as a perturbation about the&#10;limit. For sufficiently small , given the site of addition and initial&#10;configuration, the toppling sequence is [ INDEPENDENT]{} of . It is also&#10;independent of the amount of height of addition , and is same as the&#10;model with , which is the -dimensional abelian sandpile model with&#10;integer heights (hereafter referred to simply as ASM, without further&#10;qualifiers). We decompose the height variables as where Nint refers to&#10;the nearest integer value. Then the integer part of the height evolves&#10;as in the ASM. We write Here is uniformly distributed in the interval .&#10;The linearity of height transfer in toppling implies that the evolution&#10;of the variables is independent of . Thus, is a linear function of ; the&#10;precise function depends on the sequence of topplings that took place.&#10;These are determined by the sequence of addition sites up to the time ,&#10;and the initial configuration . These together will be called the&#10;evolution history of the system up to time , and denoted by . We assume&#10;that at the starting time , the variables are zero for all , and the&#10;initial configuration is a recurrent configuration of the ASM. Then,&#10;from the linearity of the toppling rules, we can write as a linear&#10;function of for , and we can write for a given history , This defines&#10;the matrix elements . These can be understood in terms of the&#10;probability distribution of the position of a marked grain in the ASM as&#10;follows. Consider the motion of a marked grain in the one dimensional&#10;height type BTW model. We start with configuration and add grains at&#10;sites according to the sequence . All grains are identical except the&#10;one added at time , which is marked. In each toppling, the marked grain&#10;jumps to one of its two neighbors with equal probability. Consider the&#10;probability that the marked grain will be found at site after a sequence&#10;of relaxation processes at time . We denote this probability as . From&#10;the toppling rules in both the models, it is easy to see that Averaging&#10;over different histories , we get the probability that a marked grain&#10;added at at time is found at a position at time in the steady state of&#10;the ASM. Denoting the latter probability by , we get where the over bar&#10;denotes averaging over different histories , consistent with the&#10;specified constraints. Here, the constraint is that must satisfy . At&#10;other places, the constraints may be different, and will be specified if&#10;not clear from the context.&#10;&#10;We shall denote the variance of a random variable by . For the specific&#10;case with , using the definition in Eq. , it is easy to show that . For&#10;non-zero , in addition to the previous term, there will be a term&#10;proportional to , as the term linear in vanishes. Hence, we can write&#10;Different are independent random variables, also independent of and have&#10;zero mean. Let . For the case when has a uniform distribution between&#10;and , we have . Then, from Eq. , we get As , the system tends to a&#10;steady state, and the average in the right hand side of Eq. becomes a&#10;function of . Also, for a given , all values of are equally likely. We&#10;define Then, for large , in the steady state ( large), the variance of&#10;height at site is , where We define to be the average of over as&#10;Evaluation of for a given history and averaging over is quite tedious&#10;for or . For , the problem has been studied in the context of residence&#10;times of grains in sand piles, and some exact results are known in&#10;specific cases . For , the calculations are much more difficult.&#10;However, some simplifications occur in large limit. We discuss these in&#10;the next section.">

  <outline text="Calculation of  in large- limit" _note="In order to find the quantity in Eq. (8), we have to average over all&#10;possible histories , which is quite difficult to evaluate exactly.&#10;However, we can determine the leading behavior of in this limit.&#10;&#10;We use the fact that the path of a marked grain in the ASM is a random&#10;walk . Consider a particle that starts away from the boundaries at ,&#10;with large, and . If it undergoes topplings between the time and under&#10;some particular history , then its probability distribution is&#10;approximately a Gaussian, centered at with width . Then, we have Using&#10;this approximation for , summing over , we get Thus, we have to&#10;calculate the average of over different histories. Here was defined as&#10;the number of topplings undergone by the marked grain. Different&#10;possible trajectories of a marked grain, for a given history, do not&#10;have the same number of topplings. However, if the typical displacement&#10;of the grain is much smaller than its distance from the end, differences&#10;between these are small, and can be neglected. There are typically&#10;topplings per grain per avalanche in the model, and a grain moves a&#10;typical distance of in one avalanche. Then, we can approximate by , the&#10;number of topplings at .&#10;&#10;Let the number of topplings at at time steps be denoted by . Then, . It&#10;can be shown that the number of topplings in different avalanches in the&#10;one dimensional ASM are nearly uncorrelated (In fact the correlation&#10;function between and varies as .). By the central limit theorem for sum&#10;of weakly correlated random variables, the mean value of grows linearly&#10;with , but the standard deviation increases only as . Then, for , the&#10;distribution is sharply peaked about the mean, and .&#10;&#10;Clearly, for , , where is the mean number of topplings per avalanche at&#10;in the ASM, given by The upper limit on for the validity of the above&#10;argument comes from the requirement that the width of the Gaussian be&#10;much less than the distance from the boundary, (without any loss of&#10;generality, we can assume that , so that it is the left boundary ), else&#10;we cannot neglect events where the marked grain leaves the pile. This&#10;gives , or equivalently, Thus we get, where is some constant.&#10;&#10;Also, we know that for , the probability that the grain stays in the&#10;pile decays exponentially as . Thus, , and also will decay exponentially&#10;with , for . Thus, we have, for some constants and , It only remains to&#10;determine the behavior of , for . In this case, in the ASM, there is a&#10;significant probability that the marked grain leaves the pile from the&#10;end. This results in a faster decay of , and hence of with time. We&#10;argue below that the behavior of the function is given by where is some&#10;constant. This can be seen as follows: Let us consider the special case&#10;when the particle starts at a site close to the boundary. Then is&#10;approximately a linear function of for small . Its spatial variation&#10;cannot be neglected, and Eq. is no longer valid. We will now argue that&#10;in this case for . The time evolution of in Eq. is well described as a&#10;diffusion with diffusion coefficient proportional to which is the mean&#10;number of topplings per avalanche at in the ASM . For understanding the&#10;long-time survival probability in this problem, we can equivalently&#10;consider the problem in a continuous-time version: consider a random&#10;walk on a half line where sites are labelled by positive integers, and&#10;the jump rate out of a site is proportional to . A particle starts at&#10;site at time . If is the probability that the particle is at at time ,&#10;then the equations for the time-evolution of are, for all , The long&#10;time solution starting with is for and large . The probability that the&#10;particle survives till time decreases as for large . We have discussed&#10;the calculation in the Appendix \[apndx:zhang\].&#10;&#10;Using Eq. , we see that scales as . It seems reasonable to assume that&#10;will scale as . Then, each term in the summation for in Eq. scales as ,&#10;and there are such terms, as the sum over has an upper cutoff&#10;proportional to , and so varies as for . This concludes the argument.&#10;&#10;We can put these three limiting behaviors into a single functional form&#10;that interpolates between these, as where , and are some constants. In&#10;Section V, we will see that results from numerical simulation are&#10;consistent with this phenomenological expression.&#10;&#10;Using this interpolation form in Eq. , and converting the sum over to an&#10;integration over a variable , we can write This integral can be&#10;simplified by a change of variable , giving where are constants, and is&#10;a function defined by It is easy to verify that diverges as for small .&#10;In particular, we note that the exponential term in the integral&#10;expression for has a significant contribution only for near . We may&#10;approximate this by dropping the exponential factor, and changing the&#10;upper limit of the integral to . The resulting integral is easily done,&#10;giving where is some constant. Averaging over , we get a behavior . Of&#10;course, the answer is not exact, and one could have constructed other&#10;interpolation forms that have the same asymptotic behavior.

  <outline text="Concluding remarks" _note="To summarize, we have studied the emergence of quasi-units in the&#10;one-dimensional Zhang sandpile model. The variance of height variables&#10;in the steady state is governed by the balance between two competing&#10;processes. The randomness in the drive i.e., the height of addition,&#10;tends to increase the variance in time. On the other hand, the topplings&#10;of height variables tend to equalize the excess height by distributing&#10;it to the nearby sites. There are on an average topplings per avalanche.&#10;Hence, in one dimension there are, on an average, topplings per site per&#10;avalanche. For large system size, the second process dominates over the&#10;first and the variance becomes low. We have shown that the variance&#10;vanishes as with increasing system size and the probability distribution&#10;of height concentrates around a non-random value which depends on the&#10;height of addition. We have also proposed a functional form for the&#10;spatial dependence of variance of height which incorporates the correct&#10;limiting behaviors, and matches very well with the numerical data.&#10;&#10;An interesting question is whether one can extend these arguments to the&#10;two-dimensional Zhang model. There is some numerical evidence for the&#10;sharpening of height peaks as the system size is increased . In the&#10;simplest scenario , there are peaks located at multiples of the&#10;quasi-unit , where is the lattice coordination number. This would imply&#10;that the asymptotic behavior of the two dimensional Zhang model is same&#10;as the height type BTW model in two dimension. However, this simple&#10;scenario can not be fully correct. During an avalanche, there is a&#10;finite probability that a site receives height from two neighbors in the&#10;previous time-step. If the height at the site before was , it will&#10;tranfer an height approximately equal to to its neighbors. As such&#10;events occur with nonzero probability, in the one site height&#10;distribution function, there would have to be peaks around , also. These&#10;peaks then give rise to other peaks. With many peaks, the definition of&#10;the width of a peak becomes somewhat ambiguous.

  <outline text="Introduction" _note="Sandpile models with stochastic toppling rules are important subclass of&#10;sandpile models . The first such model was studied by Manna , and these&#10;are usually known as Manna models in the literature. They are able to&#10;describe the avalanche behavior seen experimentally in the piles of&#10;granular media much better than the deterministic models . Also, in&#10;numerical studies, one gets better scaling collapse, and consequently,&#10;more reliable estimates for the values of the critical exponents, than&#10;for models with deterministic toppling rules .&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the theoretical understanding of models with stochastic&#10;toppling rules is much less than that of their deterministic&#10;counterparts, e.g. the Bak-Tang -Wiesenfeld (BTW) model . For example,&#10;there is no analogue of the burning test to distinguish the transient&#10;and the recurrent states of a general Manna model. For the deterministic&#10;case, it is known that all the recurrent configurations occur with equal&#10;probability in the steady state. A similar characterization of the&#10;steady state is not known in the Manna case. The steady state has been&#10;explicitly determined only for the fully directed stochastic models . In&#10;some cases, one can formally characterize the recurrent states of the&#10;model, e.g. the -dimensional Oslo rice pile model, but a straightforward&#10;direct depth-first calculation of the exact probabilities of different&#10;configurations in the steady state takes steps where is the system&#10;length . While the exact values of the critical exponents have been&#10;conjectured for dimensional directed Manna model , the prototypical&#10;undirected Manna model in one dimension has resisted an exact solution&#10;so far . In higher dimensions, most of the studies are only numerical.&#10;&#10;The conditions under which different scaling behaviors are seen in&#10;stochastic models is a long debated issue. Initial studies suggested&#10;that the stochastic sandpile model and the BTW model exhibit similar&#10;scaling behavior . However later large scale simulations showed that the&#10;stochastic sandpile models constitute a universality class different&#10;from their deterministic counterparts: the critical exponents, scaling&#10;functions and geometrical features are different for the two classes of&#10;models . Further evidence came from the qualitative differences in their&#10;avalanche distribution which has a multi-fractal nature for BTW model,&#10;whereas it follows simple finite size scaling for the Manna model. Also&#10;the directed version of the above models exhibit different scaling&#10;behavior than their undirected counterparts . Numerical results suggest&#10;that both the abelian and non-abelian Manna model constitute a&#10;universality class different from Directed-Percolation (DP) . However,&#10;the corresponding fixed points are unstable with respect to introduction&#10;of perturbation (“stickiness”) and with stickiness the critical behavior&#10;flows to the DP universality class . While there is a controversy about&#10;the generic DP behavior of undirected stochastic sandpile models; for&#10;the directed case, the numerical evidence for asymptotic DP behavior is&#10;quite convincing.&#10;&#10;While the original Manna model did not have the abelian property of the&#10;BTW model, one can construct stochastic toppling rules with abelian&#10;property . In this paper, we discuss this abelian version of the&#10;stochastic Manna model. We shall use the terms Deterministic abelian&#10;Sandpile Models (DASM) (see Ch. \[ch:intro\]) and Stochastic abelian&#10;Sandpile Models (SASM), if we need to distinguish between these two&#10;classes of models. In DASM the relaxation rules satisfy pair wise&#10;balance , which makes the model analytically tractable and the recurrent&#10;configurations become equally probable in the steady state. However the&#10;stochastic models do not have this property, and the steady state can&#10;not be determined easily.&#10;&#10;We use the algebra of the addition operators to determine the steady&#10;state of the model. This algebraic approach provides a computationally&#10;efficient method to determine the Markov evolution matrix of the model.&#10;The addition operators of SASM are not necessarily diagonalizable even&#10;if we restrict ourselves to the space of recurrent configurations. Using&#10;the abelian algebra we determine a generalized eigenvector basis in&#10;which the operators reduce to Jordan block form. We also define a&#10;transformation matrix between this basis and the configuration basis,&#10;and express the steady state in the latter. This procedure is&#10;illustrated by explicitly working out the case of a one dimensional&#10;Manna model. In this special case, we can show that each Jordan block is&#10;at most of dimension . We determine the numerically exact steady state&#10;of the model for systems of size up to and determine the asymptotic&#10;density profile by extrapolating the results.&#10;&#10;This chapter is organized as follows: In section \[sec:ch5.2\], we&#10;define the model precisely. In section \[sec:ch5.2.5\] we recapitulate&#10;the algebra of addition operators for DASM, and use it to determine the&#10;steady state. For the stochastic models same definition for the addition&#10;operators does not work and need to be redefined. We do this in section&#10;\[sec:ch5.3\], and discuss their algebra. Calculation of the eigenvalues&#10;and the Jordan block structure of the addition operators are given in&#10;section \[sec:ch5.4\]. The transformation matrix between the generalized&#10;eigenvector basis and the configuration basis is determined in section&#10;\[sec:ch5.5\], and is used to determine the steady state vector in the&#10;configuration basis in section \[sec:ch5.6\]. The exact numerical&#10;determination of the steady state is discussed in section \[sec:ch5.7\]&#10;with some concluding remarks in section \[sec:ch5.8\].">

  <outline text="The Model" _note="We define a generalized Manna model on a graph of sites with a&#10;non-negative integer height variable defined at each site . Let the&#10;threshold height at be , and the site is unstable if . If the system is&#10;stable, a sand grain is added at a randomly chosen site which increases&#10;the height by . For each site , there is a set of lists with . If a site&#10;is unstable, it relaxes by the following toppling rule: we decrease its&#10;height by . Then, with probability , we select the list , independent of&#10;any previous selections, and then add one grain to each site in that&#10;list. If a site occurs more than once in the list, we add that many&#10;grains to that site.&#10;&#10;Toppling at a site can make other sites unstable and they topple in&#10;their turn, until all the lattice sites are stable. Using an argument&#10;given in , it can be easily shown that the above toppling rule is&#10;abelian. Then, it follows from the abelian property that the&#10;probabilities of different final stable configurations are independent&#10;of the order in which different unstable sites are toppled.&#10;&#10;We illustrate these rules with some examples below.&#10;&#10;**Model A** (The one dimensional Manna model): The graph is sites on a&#10;line and , for all sites. On toppling each grain is transfered to its&#10;neighbors with equal probability. Hence we have , for all , with , , and&#10;and and . Also grains can move out of the system if toppling occurs at a&#10;boundary site.&#10;&#10;**Model B** (The one dimensional dissipative Manna model): Same as model&#10;A except that on toppling a grain can move out of the system with&#10;probability .

The corresponding probabilities are , , and .&#10;&#10;In this case, one can use periodic boundary conditions, as there is&#10;dissipation at all sites. the steady state is critical only in the limit&#10;. For the models A and B, it is easy to see that all stable&#10;configurations occur in the steady state with non-zero probability. We&#10;can also define stochastic models where the recurrent configurations&#10;form only an exponentially small fraction of all stable configurations.&#10;An example of this type is&#10;&#10;**Model C**: The graph is a square lattice with sites and . Under&#10;toppling, with equal probability two particles are transfered to either&#10;horizontal or vertical neighbors.

  <outline text="Determination of the steady state for a DASM" _note="Before we carry out the analysis of the SASM, we recapitulate how the&#10;steady state for the DASM, defined in section \[sec:dasm\], can be&#10;determined using the operator algebra of addition operators . Let us&#10;denote the space of stable states (see section \[sec:dasm\]) in the DASM&#10;as spanned by basis vectors labeled by . We define as the probability of&#10;finding the system in the basis at time . The time is in driving steps,&#10;I.E., it increases by one when a grain is added and the system is fully&#10;relaxed. To each set , we associate a vector belonging to the vector&#10;space , and write This defines a state of the system at time . Recall&#10;that, in section \[sec:dasm\], we have defined the particle addition&#10;operators , for all , which correspond to adding a sand grain at site&#10;when the system is in state configuration , and relaxing it until a&#10;stable configuration is reached. Thus, these are linear operators which&#10;act on the vector space and maps a configuration , in it, to another&#10;configuration , which is reached by the avalanche.&#10;&#10;The time-evolution of the system is Markovian and the evolution operator&#10;is defined by the master equation We can write the time-evolution&#10;operator in terms of the addition operators as where is the number of&#10;sites on the lattice. To solve the time evolution, in general, we have&#10;to diagonalize the evolution operator . Now, we have shown in section&#10;\[sec:dasm\], that the addition operators commute with each other. Then&#10;all the addition operators and hence, also have a common set of&#10;eigenvectors. Let be one such simultaneous eigenvector of the operators&#10;, with eigenvalues , respectively. Then&#10;&#10;Recall the definition of the toppling matrix , introduced in section&#10;\[sec:dasm\], for the DASM. Then, from the toppling rule, one can easily&#10;show, that Also, recall, we have shown in section \[sec:dasm\], that&#10;within the recurrent state space, each addition operator has an inverse.&#10;Then, the above relation can be written as Applying the LHS to the&#10;eigenvector gives , for every , so that , where ’s are arbitrary&#10;integers.

  <outline text="Algebra of the addition operators for SASM" _note="We use the same notations, as in the last section, but this time for a&#10;SASM. So, is the space of stable states and is a stable height&#10;configuration constituting a complete set of basis vectors.&#10;&#10;For stochastic toppling rules, the resulting state from the action of on&#10;a basis vector , is not necessarily another basis vector, but a linear&#10;combination of them. So, the addition operators have to be redefined. If&#10;the resulting configuration is with probability , we define for all .&#10;Note that the action of any of these operators on a given configuration&#10;gives a unique probability state vector.&#10;&#10;Eq. (\[a\_i\]) is a formal definition of the operators . One can think&#10;of these as matrices, but, unlike the DASM, it is quite non-trivial to&#10;actually determine the matrix elements explicitly from the toppling&#10;rules. This is because of the non-zero probability of an arbitrary large&#10;number of toppling before a steady state is reached.&#10;&#10;For an example, consider the avalanches in model A for system of size .&#10;Consider the stable configurations as the basis vectors and denote them&#10;by their height values . The action of on will generate a unstable state&#10;. Using the toppling rules we can write the following set of equations&#10;for three unstable states We see that there is a nonzero probability&#10;that the avalanche can continue for more than toppling, for any finite .&#10;e.g. in the sequence . Thus straight forward application of the&#10;relaxation rules does not result in a finite procedure to determine the&#10;unstable vector in terms of the stable configurations. Instead, we have&#10;to write Eq. (\[|0,2,0\]) as a matrix equation and then invert it. More&#10;generally, the determination of involves working in a larger space of&#10;unstable configurations.&#10;&#10;For example in model A, there are stable configurations, where each site&#10;has or particle. Total number of particles is at most . On adding one&#10;particle, the number of particles can become , where initially, only one&#10;site will have height . However, it is easy to verify that by toppling&#10;one can generate configurations where the number of particles at a site&#10;is much greater than . In fact, all the particles could be at the same&#10;site. Then the total number of stable and unstable configurations is the&#10;number of ways one can distribute or less particles on sites. It is&#10;easily seen that varies as , and one needs to invert a matrix of size .&#10;&#10;There are models, generally known as the restricted sandpile models ,&#10;where the toppling rules ensure that the heights do not exceed a fixed&#10;value. For these, the space of allowed configurations is much smaller.&#10;However, the height restriction makes the model non-abelian.&#10;&#10;In this chapter we will use the operator algebra to obtain an efficient&#10;method to determine the probabilities explicitly which requires&#10;inverting a matrix only of size . It has been shown that the addition&#10;operators for different sites commute i.e. The proof uses the fact that&#10;any stochastic toppling event can be simulated by a pseudo-random&#10;generator. This essentially makes the toppling deterministic, which has&#10;the abelian property.&#10;&#10;However, unlike the DASM, the inverse operators for SASM need not exist,&#10;even if we restrict ourselves to the set of recurrent configurations.&#10;This is because among the recurrent states, one can have two different&#10;initial probability vectors that yield the same resultant vector. This&#10;makes the determination of the matrix form of the operators difficult&#10;for this model.&#10;&#10;Apart from the abelian property, the operators also satisfy a set of&#10;algebraic equations, like the Eq. in DASM. For simplicity of&#10;presentation, now on we consider and for all sites. Then consecutive&#10;addition of grains at a site ensures that the site will topple once and&#10;transfers grains to its neighbors, irrespective of the initial height.&#10;Then the operators obey the following equation where we have used the&#10;notation for any list , and for sites outside the lattice. In particular&#10;for the examples in section \[sec:ch5.3\], these equations are as&#10;follows">

  <outline text="Jordan Block structure of the addition operators" _note="In general the matrices need not be diagonalizable. However, using the&#10;abelian property, we can construct a common set of generalized&#10;eigenvectors for all the operators such that in this basis the matrices&#10;simultaneously reduce to Jordan block form. These generalized&#10;eigenvectors split the vector space into disjoint subspaces, each&#10;corresponding to distinct set of eigenvalues.&#10;&#10;There will be at least one common eigenvector in each subspace, for all&#10;the addition operators.&#10;&#10;Consider one of the operators, say . Let be the subspace of spanned by&#10;the (right) generalized eigenvectors of corresponding to the eigenvalue&#10;. There is at least one such generalized eigenvector, so is non-null. We&#10;pick one of the other addition operators, say . From the fact that&#10;commutes with , it immediately follows that acting on any vector in the&#10;subspace leaves it within the same subspace. Diagonalizing within this&#10;subspace, we construct a possibly smaller but still non-null subspace&#10;which is spanned by simultaneous generalized eigenvectors of and with&#10;eigenvalues and . Repeating this argument with the other operators, one&#10;can construct vectors which are simultaneous eigenvectors of all the .&#10;&#10;Let be such an eigenvector, with Then from Eq.()the eigenvalues satisfy&#10;the following set of equations where we have used the notation , for any&#10;list .&#10;&#10;Rather than work with this general case, we will consider the special&#10;case in model A for simplicity. No extra complications occur in the more&#10;general case. Then, from Eq.(\[modA\]), the corresponding eigenvalue&#10;equation is These are L coupled quadratic equations in complex variables&#10;. We can reduce them to linear equations by taking square root where .&#10;The Eq. (\[a\_0\]) sets the values for the eigenvalues of and which are&#10;There are different choices for the set of different ’s and for each&#10;such choice, we get a set of eigenvalues . In general, there will be&#10;degenerate sets of eigenvalues and the degeneracy arises if one of the&#10;is zero. Using the triangular inequality in we get i.e. are convex&#10;functions of discrete variables . Then, given the boundary condition in&#10;Eq. (\[a\_1\]), there could at most be one in the solution for a given ,&#10;which means that each eigenvalue set can be at most doubly degenerate.&#10;&#10;Finding the number of degeneracies of solutions is interesting but&#10;difficult in general. We show that&#10;&#10;For (mod ) the number of degenerate sets of eigenvalues .&#10;&#10;Consider the system of length , with being a non negative integer. For&#10;any given set , to , it is possible to construct a solution of Eq.&#10;(\[eta\]) with which satisfies and . Clearly, from Eq.(\[eta\]), if we&#10;have the solution corresponding to a particular set , one can construct&#10;the solution corresponding to using . Using this symmetry we extend ( to&#10;) to form a set for to as follows: This is a solution of Eq.(\[eta\])&#10;for the set with and this solution satisfies the boundary conditions , ,&#10;and (Fig.). There are such solutions possible corresponding to all&#10;possible sets of , and this gives the lower bound for the number of&#10;degenerate solutions.&#10;&#10;\[figure1\]&#10;&#10;A direct numerical calculation for shows that if (mod ), all sets of&#10;eigenvalues are distinct. We present the degeneracies of the solutions&#10;in Table.. Calculation for simple choices of shows that the degeneracies&#10;are possible only if (mod ).&#10;&#10;For example, consider for and for the rest of the sites it is .

Similarly for the set with and for rest of the sites&#10;imposes a condition on length , which is also a subset of (mod ).&#10;Finding a general proof that degeneracies occur only if (mod ) remain an&#10;open problem.&#10;&#10;For each degenerate subspace there is a generalized eigenvector linearly&#10;independent of the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of the&#10;subspace. In general, let us denote them by , where for the eigenvector&#10;and for the generalized eigenvector. For non-degenerate subspace can&#10;only be . The vectors satisfy the following equations where ’s are&#10;complex numbers. Then using the Eq.

  <outline text="Numerical Results" _note="Here we describe the results of numerical calculations for the exact&#10;steady state of model A for different system lengths and discuss its&#10;properties.

The maximum number of steps ()&#10;are required for the inversion of the transformation matrix . We have&#10;used the Gauss-Jordan elimination method for the inversion. It is&#10;important to note that, the maximum system length , possible to treat by&#10;this method, is determined by the limited memory of the computers, and&#10;not by the computation time. Using desktop computers we were able to&#10;determine exactly for systems of size .&#10;&#10;We note that as is increased, the second largest eigenvalue of tends to&#10;. Thus, the gap between the largest and the next largest eigenvalue of&#10;the relaxation matrix does not tend to zero. This gap measures the&#10;relaxation time of the system in terms of the macro-time unit of&#10;interval between addition of grains. However, the average duration of an&#10;avalanche measured in terms of micro-time unit of duration of a single&#10;toppling event does diverge, as system size increases.&#10;&#10;An interesting question is the extent of variation between probabilities&#10;of different configurations in the steady state. In the one-dimensional&#10;Oslo model, for a system of sites, the ratio of probabilities of the&#10;most probable to the least probable configuration varies as . However in&#10;model A, we find that the ratio is not quit as large, and it only varies&#10;approximately as (Fig.\[fig2\]) for large .&#10;&#10;This suggests that the exact steady state is not a product measure&#10;state. To check this we define a product basis , where could be any one&#10;of the two orthogonal vectors with a real number. Then in this basis the&#10;steady state can be written as We choose so that the ratio between the&#10;amplitudes of basis vectors with next-largest and largest amplitudes&#10;becomes as small as possible (this would become zero, if the state was a&#10;product measure state). In Fig.\[fig3\], we have plotted for system of&#10;size , the relative amplitudes in both configuration basis and the&#10;optimized product basis as a function of the rank of the basis vectors&#10;with the vectors arranged in decreasing orders of their amplitudes. In&#10;the optimized basis the second highest probability is only times smaller&#10;than the highest probability. This shows that the steady state measure&#10;is not a product measure.&#10;&#10;\[second\]&#10;&#10;\[third\]&#10;&#10;The steady state density for different sites are plotted in Fig.&#10;\[fig4\] for different system sizes.

<outline text="Relation to the theory of discrete analytic functions [apndx:dhf]" _note="The sandpile patterns we studied are characterized in terms of discrete&#10;analytic functions (DAF) on different discretizations of the complex&#10;plane. For the pattern in Fig. \[fig:hexpicl1\], it is the DAF on a&#10;hexagonal lattice, which increases logarithmically at large distances as&#10;in Eq. (\[logasymp\]).&#10;&#10;Studies of DAF started with the work of Kirchhoff on resistor networks ,&#10;and has been studied subsequently by many others . However, we have not&#10;encountered any work on DAF on many sheeted Riemann surfaces. In the&#10;following we present a way to determine DAF on a square discretization&#10;of Riemann surfaces.&#10;&#10;Consider a square grid of points , where are integers and is the lattice&#10;spacing. Let be a complex function defined at every site on the grid.&#10;The function is defined to be discrete analytic if it satisfies the&#10;discrete Cauchy Riemann condition at all elementary squares on the grid&#10;as shown in Fig. \[fig:square\].&#10;&#10;In complex analysis, simple examples of analytic functions are , and any&#10;polynomial of is also analytic. For DAF, it is clear, using the&#10;linearity of equation (\[eq:dcr\]), that sum of DAF is also discrete&#10;analytic. However, not all positive integer powers of are discrete&#10;analytic. It is easy to check that the functions , , , are discrete&#10;analytic, but is not. We can however construct polynomial functions of&#10;and , that are discrete analytic. Two such examples are and .&#10;&#10;We define a function as a homogeneous polynomial in , and , of degree ,&#10;which is a DAF. Using homogeneity, we have and then using , we can&#10;express in terms of . This fixes up to a multiplicative constant. The&#10;normalization is fixed by requiring that as tends to zero, . Then using&#10;Cauchy Riemann conditions it is easily seen that , for all integers ,&#10;has a series expansion in of the form where and so on. For an integer ,&#10;this series will terminate after a finite number of terms, and all of&#10;them can be determined iteratively.&#10;&#10;It is possible to analytically continue the functions for rational&#10;values of . For example, Then, this analytic continuation of provides us&#10;the discrete analytic functions which in the limit grows as , for any&#10;real positive values of . It is interesting to note that the function ,&#10;used in to characterize the pattern in Fig. \[fig:flatone\](b), is equal&#10;to , up to a multiplicative constant. The patterns in the presence of a&#10;line of sinks, or near wedges studied in involve other rational values.&#10;For example, for the pattern near a line sink, one requires the function&#10;.">

For the degenerate subspace we order the eigenvector ,&#10;defined in Eq.(\[gen\]), before the generalized eigenvector . Then in&#10;this basis the matrices corresponding to the addition operators have the&#10;following Jordan block form. The transformation matrix , discussed in&#10;section , between the generalized eigenvector basis and the&#10;configuration basis has the following form where the configuration basis&#10;vectors are chosen in the following order , , , , , , , and . The matrix&#10;is non-singular, and the inverse can be calculated numerically.
