<outline text="Conclusion" _note="The careful design and analysis of our GPU multisplit implementations&#10;allow us to provide significant performance speedups for multisplit&#10;operations over traditional sort-based methods. The generality of our&#10;multisplit algorithm let us extend it further into other interesting&#10;applications, such as building a competitive GPU radix sort, getting&#10;significant improvements in Single Source Shortest Path problem, and&#10;providing a promising GPU histogram mostly suitable for small number of&#10;buckets. Beyond simply demonstrating the design and implementation of a&#10;family of fast and efficient multisplit primitives, we offer three main&#10;lessons that are broadly useful for parallel algorithm design and&#10;implementation: Considering a warp-synchronous programming by leveraging&#10;warp-wide hardware intrinsics and promoting warp-level privatization of&#10;memory, where applicable, can potentially brings interesting and&#10;efficient implementations; Minimize global (device-wide) operations,&#10;even at the cost of increased local computation; the benefit of more&#10;coalesced memory accesses outweighs the cost of local reordering.">
