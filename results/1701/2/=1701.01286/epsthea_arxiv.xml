    <title>Improving power of genetic association studies by extreme phenotype
sampling: a review and some new results</title>
    <abstract>Extreme phenotype sampling is a selective genotyping design for genetic
association studies where only individuals with extreme values of a
continuous trait are genotyped for a set of genetic variants. Under
financial or other limitations, this design is assumed to improve the
power to detect associations between genetic variants and the trait,
compared to randomly selecting the same number of individuals for
genotyping. Here we present extensions of likelihood models that can be
used for inference when the data are sampled according to the extreme
phenotype sampling design. Computational methods for parameter
estimation and hypothesis testing are provided. We consider methods for
common variant genetic effects and gene-environment interaction effects
in linear regression models with a normally distributed trait. We use
simulated and real data to show that extreme phenotype sampling can be
powerful compared to random sampling, but that this does not hold for
all extreme sampling methods and situations.

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Extreme phenotype sampling (EPS) is an outcome-dependent sampling design&#10;for genetic association studies. For this design, individuals with high&#10;or low values of a particular continuously measurable phenotype (trait)&#10;are genotyped. When the number of individuals that can be genotyped is&#10;limited, such samples are assumed to give good power to detect&#10;associations between genetic variants and the trait. Random sampling is&#10;the most relevant competing design. Extreme samples must be analyzed&#10;with statistical methods that properly account for the sampling bias,&#10;and these methods are not trivial. Random samples can be analyzed with&#10;readily available standard methods and are therefore preferable when it&#10;comes to data analysis. However, low statical power is an important&#10;issue in genetic association studies (, ). Here we attempt to answer&#10;whether, when and to what degree extreme sampling is more powerful than&#10;random sampling in genetic association studies. For this purpose we have&#10;extended relevant likelihood methods for parameter estimation and&#10;hypothesis testing.&#10;&#10;We consider genetic association studies where the aim is to detect&#10;common genetic variants that are associated with some trait, and also to&#10;quantify associations. We consider biallelic single-nucleotide&#10;polymorphism (SNP) data. For a particular SNP, the observed genotype for&#10;an individual is either , or , where represents the minor-allele in the&#10;population. We consider additive genetic models so that the genotype is&#10;coded as 0, 1 or 2 according to the number of copies of the&#10;minor-allele. In a GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY (GWAS) the observed&#10;genotypes of selected SNPs along the genome, so-called genetic markers,&#10;are tested for association with a phenotype in a sample of individuals.&#10;The number of SNPs is large (). The purpose of such studies is to detect&#10;regions in the genome that are associated with the phenotype. In what we&#10;will refer to as a CANDIDATE SNP STUDY, a small collection SNPs are&#10;analyzed. These SNPs can for example be chosen based on results from&#10;studies in other populations, or from studies of related traits and&#10;diseases. Then the focus is on replication and effect size estimation&#10;rather than detection.&#10;&#10;Due to high genotyping costs and low statistical power to detect&#10;significant associations between genetic variants and complex traits,&#10;selective genotyping has been proposed as a strategy for achieving good&#10;statistical power under sample size limitations. Genotyping only the&#10;phenotypically extreme individuals was proposed for mapping quantitative&#10;trait loci (QTL) in experimental organisms (, ). The methodology was&#10;further developed for linkage disequilibrium mapping of QTLs by , , , ,&#10;among others. Power studies have been performed by and . Most methods&#10;were not fully efficient because they involved discretizing the&#10;continous trait, discarding individuals who were homozygous for the&#10;minor-allele or not accounting for the biased sampling. To that effect&#10;proposed likelihood methods that made full use of the data and accounted&#10;for the selective genotyping design. Recently, likelihood methods for&#10;multivariate trait-dependent sampling has also been considered (, ).&#10;Selective genotyping has also recently been proposed in studies of rare&#10;genetic variants (, , ). The extreme phenotype sampling design can be&#10;considered a special case of the outcome-dependent sampling design&#10;described by and .&#10;&#10;The power, limitations and practical utility of extreme phenotype&#10;sampling as compared to random sampling in modern GWAS and candidate SNP&#10;studies has in our opinion not been sufficiently characterized, and this&#10;might explain why the design has not been much used. considered&#10;regression models for continuous phenotypes and developed likelihood&#10;models for extreme sampling data for the special case where only one&#10;covariate (the genetic variant) was included in the regression model.&#10;The power of two different extreme sampling designs was estimated, but&#10;not compared to random sampling. Using the asymptotic distribution of&#10;the score test statistic under the alternative hypothesis showed that&#10;the methods by theoretically can give better power than a random&#10;sampling design in the special case with no non-genetic covariates.&#10;showed that their likelihood method for the outcome-dependent sampling&#10;design yielded more efficient parameter estimates than would be obtained&#10;using a simple random sample of the same size. We extend the likelihood&#10;methods for the EPS-design to include non-genetic (environmental)&#10;explanatory variables as well as gene-environment interaction terms. As&#10;experienced by us in a study of gene-environment interactions and&#10;obesity using an extreme sampling design this additional model&#10;complexity is necessary for application purposes . We assess the&#10;statistical power and other properties of our methods using both&#10;simulated and real data. The data set is from the HUNT study&#10;(Helseundersøkelsen i Nord-Trøndelag) which comprises health information&#10;on the population of Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway . We use data from a&#10;GWAS on the trait MAXIMUM OXYGEN UPTAKE based on the HUNT Fitness study&#10;. All our computational methods for parameter estimation and hypothesis&#10;testing under the EPS-design are available in our R-package.">

<outline text="Models and methods" _note="We consider complex traits that are continuously measurable and can be&#10;assumed to be normally distributed in the population. Let the th&#10;individual in a population (or large random sample) of size have&#10;observed trait value , environmental variables , and SNP genotypes .&#10;Assume that the continuous trait can be modeled by the linear regression&#10;model where represents a vector of interactions between some&#10;environmental and genetic covariates, e.g. for some and , . We consider&#10;GWAS and candidate-SNP studies. In genome-wide studies we analyze a&#10;large number of SNPs, and each SNP is tested separately for association&#10;with the phenotype ( against , ) without any interaction effects.&#10;-values are compared to a significance threshold that is determined by&#10;the multiple testing burden. In candidate-SNP studies, a few selected&#10;SNPs are studied, and the aim is to test for associations between the&#10;phenotype and all or some of the genetic variables ( against , or&#10;against , ), and to obtain parameter estimates and confidence intervals&#10;for the genetic effects. Furthermore, it is also of interest to study&#10;gene-environment interaction effects ( vs ). Assume that due to&#10;financial or other limitations, only individuals can be genotyped. We&#10;define extreme phenotypes as observations by and , for some cut-off&#10;values and such that . In the sample of size , the cut-offs can be&#10;chosen such that we sample the most extreme individuals (e.g. from each&#10;tail), or we could choose less extreme cut-offs and thereafter draw&#10;individuals from the extremes. The methods presented here apply to both&#10;situations. Our main analysis concerns two different extreme sampling&#10;designs which we refer to as the EPS-only and the EPS-full sampling&#10;designs. These are extensions of the designs discussed by . In the&#10;EPS-only design, observations of any variable (, or ) are available ONLY&#10;for extreme phenotype individuals. In the EPS-full design, observations&#10;of the phenotype () and environmental covariates () are available for&#10;the FULL population, while genetic variants () are only observed for the&#10;extremes. Let denote the set of indexes of the extreme phenotype&#10;individuals.">
  <outline text="EPS-only" _note="For the EPS-only sampling design the observations are available for all&#10;individuals , i.e. all extreme-phenotype individuals. We consider two&#10;different statistical methods for this design; the EPS-only binary&#10;method and the EPS-only (continuous) method.&#10;&#10;The first method treats the lower and upper extremes as binary responses&#10;and we refer to this method as the EPS-only binary method. The second&#10;method takes the continuity of the trait into account, and we refer to&#10;this as the EPS-only (continuous) method.">
    <outline text="EPS-only binary" _note="Were we treat the lower and upper phenotypic extremes as a binary&#10;response. One method for analysis of EPS-only data is to test whether&#10;allele frequencies are significantly different between the two extreme&#10;tails, for example by using contingency tables. We use a logistic&#10;regression model in order to include environmental covariates and&#10;gene-environment interaction terms. Define the variable such that if ,&#10;if . Let denote the probability , such that . A logistic regression&#10;model can be fitted to the dichotomized extreme sample data. Under the&#10;two-sided hypothesis in the linear regression model , there is no&#10;difference between allele frequencies in the lower and upper extremes,&#10;which in the dichotomized sample can be tested by the two-sided&#10;hypothesis , and similarly for gene-environment interactions. Hypothesis&#10;tests for this model can be done using standard methods for logistic&#10;regression. Note that the parameters of the logistic regression model&#10;are directly dependent upon the choice of and and comparison of results&#10;between studies must be done cautiously.">

    <outline text="EPS-only (continuous)" _note="A likelihood model for EPS-only samples with a continuous response was&#10;proposed by , then called the conditional likelihood. Here, we extend&#10;this likelihood to include environmental covariates and gene-environment&#10;interactions and develop the score test. Let denote a random variable&#10;from the extremes of the distribution of . Then and the probability&#10;density can be derived accordingly (see Appendix A). The likelihood for&#10;the EPS-only sample is where is the cumulative probability distribution&#10;and is the density function of the standard normal distribution, and .&#10;&#10;We have implemented a quasi-Newton numerical optimization method to&#10;obtain likelihood estimates. We obtain approximate confidence intervals&#10;for some parameter by , where is the maximum likelihood estimate and is&#10;such that .

In the&#10;GWAS setting we strongly prefer a computationally efficient test due to&#10;the large number of tests. Using the score test, the null model can be&#10;fitted once and for GWAS in particular, the test is then computationally&#10;fast compared to the likelihood ratio test which requires model fitting&#10;under all alternative hypotheses. For the EPS-only likelihood , we have&#10;derived a closed form expression for the score test statistic (see&#10;Appendix A.1). The expression is mathematically complex and requires&#10;some tedious algebra, but the reward is significant computational&#10;efficiency. showed that in the most simple model () the score test&#10;statistic for derived from the continuous EPS-only likelihood is&#10;equivalent to the the score test statistic derived from the likelihood&#10;for a normal linear regression model.

  <outline text="EPS-full" _note="The EPS-full sample consists of observations for all , and observations&#10;for all . In other words, is missing for all individuals . The missing&#10;observations are missing at random (MAR) because the observations are&#10;not missing due to the unobserved , but rather due to the observed value&#10;of the phenotype . We consider both a likelihood based method and&#10;multiple imputation for this sample.">
    <outline text="EPS-full likelihood" _note="Under MAR the likelihood that ignores the missing-mechanism is valid for&#10;likelihood inference from the frequentist perspective . It is necessary&#10;to specify or estimate the distribution of the variables that are&#10;missing. We assume in the most general case that is dependent upon some&#10;(or all) of the covariates in , denoted by . We assume that the sample&#10;space of is discrete with elements , . We let , denote elements of the&#10;sample space of and we assume that can take any value in this sample&#10;space for all , albeit with different probabilities. The likelihood for&#10;the EPS-full sample is an extension of the so-called full likelihood by&#10;and is derived in Appendix B. The EPS-full likelihood is where is the&#10;density function of the standard normal distribution and is the&#10;probability mass function of the SNPs. Note that to all intents and&#10;purposes is a constant vector in the EPS-full model, while and are&#10;random. The missing-structure is determined by the choice of and . These&#10;parameters may be chosen such that the distinctness condition for the&#10;ignorability principle does not hold (e.g. choosing as cut-offs the&#10;quantiles of the empirical distribution of ). Then the likelihood that&#10;ignores the missing mechanism is still valid, but not fully efficient&#10;(e.g. there is some information about the distribution of in the&#10;empirical quantiles). We prefer to ignore the missing-mechanism so that&#10;the likelihood can be used for various trait-dependent sampling designs.&#10;&#10;In some models, the distribution of the genotypes of the SNPs does not&#10;depend on the value of the non-genetic covariates and . However, in the&#10;presence of confounding effects (e.g. population stratification), the&#10;distribution of the genotypes will differ in subsets of the sample, and&#10;the assumed genotype distribution must account for this. The sample&#10;space for each SNP is , and we assume that , and . A more general&#10;distribution of the missing covariate in a similar likelihood model has&#10;been considered in the literature (, ) but we have used this simple SNP&#10;property for computational purposes. If Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is&#10;assumed , then we have , and , where is the minor allele frequency. In&#10;GWA studies where SNPs are tested one at a time a joint distribution of&#10;the genetic variants is not relevant. In candidate-SNP studies, the SNPs&#10;that are considered are typically such that the genotype distributions&#10;can be assumed to be statistically independent (e.g. SNPs from different&#10;genes or chromosomes), and one can define the joint distribution as the&#10;product of the marginal distributions. Otherwise, a multivariate&#10;multinomial distribution can be used.&#10;&#10;As for the EPS-only likelihood, we have implemented a quasi-Newton&#10;numerical optimization method to obtain maximum likelihood estimates and&#10;confidence intervals. showed that the observed information matrix can be&#10;used as an estimate of the true information matrix for likelihoods that&#10;ignore the missing-mechanism.&#10;&#10;The EPS-full likelihood is valid for direct-likelihood inference , which&#10;ensures validity of the likelihood ratio test. For the score test, the&#10;asymptotic variance of the score vector depends on the&#10;missing-mechanism. We therefore derived the score test by using the&#10;observed information matrix under the null to approximate the asymptotic&#10;variance of the score vector, which is a valid estimate of the true&#10;information matrix . See Appendix B.1 for the derivation of the EPS-full&#10;score test for . Again, the derivation is complex, but the test is&#10;computationally efficient. We used the result of to obtain the simplest&#10;closed form expression for the score test statistic. If covariates with&#10;a missing-structure are present in the null model, for example when&#10;testing , a similar (relatively) simple closed form expression for the&#10;score test statistic cannot be attained, and we have implemented the&#10;likelihood ratio test for this purpose.">

    <outline text="EPS-full with multiple imputation" _note="Multiple imputation (MI) is a tool that can be used for parameter&#10;estimation and hypothesis testing for the linear model when covariates&#10;are MAR. We use the method of multivariate imputation by chained&#10;equations (MICE), also known as fully conditional specification .&#10;Broadly speaking, the method imputes the missing genotypes by sampling&#10;from an empirical conditional distribution of the genetic variant for&#10;individual , given all other observations in the sample. This is&#10;repeated to create different data sets in which model inference is&#10;performed. Lastly, parameter estimates or test statistics are pooled&#10;into one estimate. The MICE method is readily available in many&#10;statistical softwares, and we have used the R-package `mice` . Our aim&#10;is not to develop a specific multiple imputation method for extreme&#10;sampling in genetic association studies, but rather to compare our&#10;proposed EPS-full likelihood method to an existing inference method for&#10;missing data problems.

We set and such that the set consisted of the lowest and&#10;highest extremes of the empirical phenotype distribution.

Also here, the&#10;EPS-full method performed the best in our simulations, while the&#10;EPS-only method was slightly better than a random sample. The EPS-only&#10;binary and EPS-full MI methods again had the lowest estimated power.&#10;&#10;[cccccccc]{}&#10;&#10;------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;&amp; &amp; Full &amp; Random &amp; EPS-only &amp; EPS-only &amp; EPS-full &amp; EPS-full\&#10;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; continuous &amp; binary &amp; likelihood &amp; MI\&#10;&#10;------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10; &amp;0.8 &amp; 84.13 &amp; 56.45 &amp; 55.95 &amp; 33.21 &amp; 62.25 &amp; 18.51\&#10;&amp;1.0 &amp; 96.21 &amp; 75.45 &amp; 75.07 &amp; 47.32 &amp; 81.21 &amp; 33.00\&#10;&amp;1.2 &amp; 99.34 &amp; 89.45 &amp; 88.13 &amp; 62.44 &amp; 93.00 &amp; 52.73\&#10;\&#10;&#10;------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10; &amp; 0.4 &amp; 85.54 &amp; 63.57 &amp; 57.72 &amp; 27.95 &amp; 69.46 &amp; 29.97\&#10;&amp;0.6 &amp; 99.51 &amp; 92.96 &amp; 89.73 &amp; 50.66 &amp; 96.14 &amp; 73.08\&#10;&amp;0.8 &amp; 100.0 &amp; 99.74 &amp; 99.16 &amp; 77.04 &amp; 99.94 &amp; 97.57\&#10;">

<outline text="Application to data from the HUNT study" _note="We assessed the extreme sampling methods by application in a relevant&#10;data set. Our data set comes from the HUNT Fitness study . A genome-wide&#10;association study for maximum volume uptake of oxygen () has been&#10;performed by co-authors Anja Bye, Einar Ryeng and Ulrik Wisløff. The&#10;participants in this study represent a full sample (all participants&#10;were genotyped) and the trait can be assumed normally distributed in the&#10;population. In the original study, the regression model was used to test&#10;against for . The non-genetic covariates were age, sex and physical&#10;activity (PA). In the original study, the main associations between&#10;genetic variants and oxygen uptake was found in chromosome 1. We&#10;therefore used this chromosome to illustrate our methods and the number&#10;of SNPs to test was then . We here excluded all participants with&#10;missing non-genetic covariates (age, sex, physical activity). The full&#10;sample size was then .&#10;&#10;We considered the fictitious situation where we could only afford to&#10;genotype half of the full sample. We performed tests for association&#10;across chromosome 1 using the full data set, a random sample of size and&#10;extreme samples (lower and upper quartiles). The full data set also had&#10;some missing genotype observations, as is common in genetic association&#10;studies. For the full, random and EPS-only samples, we imputed the mean&#10;genotype. For the EPS-full model we assume that the sample space of each&#10;genetic variant is and mean imputation would be at odds with this&#10;assumption. However, when genotypes are missing at random (MAR) or&#10;missing completely at random (MCAR), the EPS-full likelihood is valid.&#10;We assumed MCAR for the initially missing genotypes, and MAR for the&#10;genotypes that were missing due to extreme sampling, and then no&#10;imputation was necessary. For the EPS-full MI method we considered one&#10;SNP at a time and imputation was then based only on , sex, age and&#10;physical activity. The Manhattan plot for each sampling method is shown&#10;in Figure \[fig:manhattan1\]. A Manhattan plot is a plot of , being the&#10;-value from the two-sided test of , against the position of the SNP on&#10;the genome. Such plots are typical for GWAS, and regions on the genome&#10;where there is a peak in -values are considered to be of further&#10;interest. In the Manhattan plot of the full sample we see that such a&#10;peak appears in chromosome 1. Furthermore, we see a very similar result&#10;for the EPS-full sample for both the likelihood and MI methods. The peak&#10;can also be distinguished in the EPS-only model, but not when using the&#10;EPS-only binary method, nor in the random sample. Genotyping only&#10;extreme phenotype individuals in this study could have been sufficient&#10;to detect the same region that was found when genotyping all&#10;individuals. We note that the performance of EPS-full MI method was much&#10;better here than using simulated data. We also note that the extreme&#10;sample as analyzed by the EPS-only (continuous) method is clearly better&#10;than the “unlucky” random sample drawn here.&#10;&#10;For the top finding in the full sample we also estimated in the full,&#10;random sample and extreme samples. Parameter estimates were (, ) in the&#10;full sample, (, ) in the random sample, (, ) in the EPS-only sample, (,&#10;) in the EPS-full sample with the maximum likelihood method, and (, ) in&#10;the EPS-full sample using multiple imputation. The results from the&#10;EPS-full likelihood method was closest to the results of the full&#10;sample. All EPS-methods were slightly biased upwards.">

We refer to the EES-only design as a sample where we only&#10;observe individuals with extreme exposure values, as considered by .&#10;Furthermore, we considered an EES-full design where extreme exposure&#10;individuals are genotyped but where non-genetic information is also&#10;available for all other individuals. EES-only data can be analyzed using&#10;standard linear regression methods, while EES-full data can be analyzed&#10;with the EPS-full likelihood . The missing-mechanism is MCAR since is a&#10;not a random variable in these models. We set up a simulation study to&#10;compare the performance of the EES designs to the EPS designs for&#10;gene-environment interaction effects.

  <outline text="Combining extreme and random sampling" _note="The outcome-dependent sampling design (, ) is a generalization of&#10;extreme phenotype sampling. The range of the trait is divided into&#10;segments, and individuals from each segment are sampled with different&#10;probabilities. These probabilities can be set so that we sample for&#10;example only from the extremes. Additionally, proposed to include a&#10;random sample of size . Motivated by this design, we consider a design&#10;where we first select a random sample of size to be genotyped, and&#10;thereafter sample extreme-phenotype individuals. We assume an EPS-full&#10;sampling design so that non-genetic information is available in the full&#10;sample. We consider a full data set of size , and a genotyped sample of&#10;size .

<outline text="Discussion" _note="We have here considered a sampling design for genetic association&#10;studies that has been proposed to increase power of genetic association&#10;studies with limited sample sizes. Under the EPS design, individuals&#10;with an extreme phenotype are selected for genotyping. If a true&#10;association exists between the trait and a genetic variant, the extreme&#10;sample will be enriched with homozygous individuals, i.e. individuals&#10;with none or two copies of the minor-allele (assuming an additive&#10;effect). We have presented relevant statistical methods for this design;&#10;some methods are currently used (EPS-only binary) and some methods have&#10;to a lesser extent been used in practice (EPS-only continuous and&#10;EPS-full). The EPS-only binary method is a valid choice for extreme&#10;phenotype samples, and it is also simple to use. However, we have shown&#10;that the dichotomization of the continuous trait eliminates any&#10;potential gain in power due to extreme sampling, as compared to random&#10;sampling. The EPS-only continuous method is a likelihood method that&#10;takes into account the continuous probability distribution of the&#10;extremes. For this method, we have shown how to obtain parameter&#10;estimates and perform hypothesis tests for parameters of a linear&#10;regression model that is assumed to hold in the full population. Using&#10;the EPS-only likelihood method, we have seen that extreme samples can be&#10;more powerful than random samples. In some studies non-genetic variables&#10;will be known for the full population (or large sample) while only the&#10;extreme phenotype individuals are genotyped. We then have a missing&#10;covariate sample where the missing-mechanism is MAR. The EPS-full&#10;likelihood was derived based on this principle. We have shown through&#10;simulations and real data applications that the power of the EPS-full&#10;design can be similar to analyzing the full population. The EPS-full&#10;sample can also be analyzed using a multiple imputation approach. In our&#10;simulated data the EPS-full MI method had low power, while the then&#10;correctly specified EPS-full likelihood model performed significantly&#10;better. In the application to real data the multiple imputation method&#10;performed similarly to the likelihood method. Multiple imputation could&#10;be a useful method for analysis of extreme sampling data, but&#10;methodological improvements towards computational efficiency should be&#10;considered.&#10;&#10;We have extended current statistical methods for EPS-data to include&#10;both genetic and non-genetic (environmental) covariates in order to&#10;comply with practical situations. Derivation of the score test for the&#10;EPS-only and EPS-full design is algebraically tedious and details are&#10;therefore only given in the appendix. We consider the computational&#10;efficiency of the score test to be important for genome-wide analysis&#10;where thousands of tests are performed. We also derived likelihood&#10;methods for estimating and testing gene-environment interaction effects.&#10;This was based on relevance for genetic association studies, as&#10;previously experienced by us . We showed that extreme phenotype sampling&#10;can be more powerful than random sampling when testing for&#10;gene-environment interaction effects. For specific gene-environment&#10;interaction situations we also showed that the extreme exposure design&#10;can be more powerful than both random and extreme phenotype sampling.&#10;&#10;Some limitations of extreme sampling for genetic association studies&#10;also need to be discussed. First of all, extreme phenotype sampling is a&#10;complicated procedure compared to random sampling and requires&#10;sophisticated statistical methods. Second, we base our methods on the&#10;assumption of normality. This assumption can be difficult to check when&#10;one only has extreme data. Thirdly, the data could be difficult to&#10;include in larger studies (consortia, meta-analysis) due to the&#10;non-standard design. Furthermore, the issue of confounding (for example&#10;due to population stratification) is of relevance and the EPS-full&#10;method is particularly sensitive to unobserved confounding effects (see&#10;Appendix C for an illustration of this issue in the HUNT data). Lastly,&#10;for genetic association studies and GWAS in particular there are several&#10;quality control procedures that are done prior to data analysis. In an&#10;extreme sample it is not clear that all QC methods apply directly.&#10;Therefore, we advocate to supplement the extreme sample with a random&#10;sample so that the random sample can be used for checking model&#10;assumptions, confounding, etc. We showed in the last Section of this&#10;paper that a mixture of a random sample and an EPS-full sample can be&#10;almost as powerful as an EPS-full sample.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, we have presented methods for extreme phenotype sampling&#10;and shown that the design CAN give better power than random sampling in&#10;genetic association studies where the sample size for genotyping is&#10;limited. However, only one method (EPS-full) was here found to be&#10;clearly better, while other methods were slightly better (EPS-only&#10;continuous) or often worse (EPS-only binary) than random sampling. We&#10;have extended methods towards testing and modeling of gene-environment&#10;interaction effects and shown that also for this purpose, extreme&#10;phenotype sampling can be useful. If the appropriate statistical methods&#10;are used, it is possible to achieve significantly improved power in&#10;genetic association studies with continuous traits by genotyping&#10;extreme-phenotype individuals instead of a random sample.">

<outline text="Confounding effects in the HUNT data" _note="We use the data to illustrate the issue of confounding effects in the&#10;EPS-full likelihood specifically, and association studies in general.&#10;This also highlights the importance of developing models and tests for&#10;genetic effects where non-genetic environmental covariates are included.&#10;In the data, we observed confounding effects between genotypes of some&#10;SNPs, sex and . Some of the SNPs in the data have genotypes that are&#10;highly correlated with sex. Sex has a strong effect on , so that&#10;spurious results were found when sex was not included as a covariate in&#10;the regression model. The effect of sex on oxygen uptake was then&#10;mediated through the genetic variants. We have illustrated this in&#10;Figure \[fig:manhattan2\]. The plot Full 1 shows the -values for the&#10;full sample when the covariate was not included in the model, while the&#10;plot Full 2 shows the results when was included. The 30 smallest -values&#10;for the first model are marked red in both plots. We see that including&#10;sex as a covariate removed the false positives due to confounding. In&#10;Figure \[fig:manhattan2\] we have also presented results for the&#10;EPS-full model when was not included as a covariate and was not assumed&#10;dependent upon (EPS-full 1), the EPS-full model when was included as a&#10;covariate but was not assumed dependent upon (EPS-full 2) and finally&#10;when confounding effects were accounted for by including as a covariate&#10;and letting the distribution of be different between men and women&#10;(EPS-full 3).

<outline text="Power estimates under MCAR" _note="Under the assumption that out of individuals in a population can be&#10;genotyped, a reasonable alternative to extreme sampling is random&#10;sampling. Throughout this paper, we compared the power of different&#10;tests for both extreme and random samples with equally many genotyped&#10;individuals. We considered random samples of size where no information&#10;was known for the individuals that were not sampled for genotyping.&#10;However, as with extreme samples, random samples (RS) can also come in&#10;two types. We refer to these as RS-only and RS-full. The RS-only sample&#10;consists of observations for the genotyped individuals that were&#10;randomly chosen, as used in our analysis. This sample can be analyzed&#10;with standard methods for linear regression due to the MCAR (missing&#10;completely at random) criterion. The RS-complete sample consists of&#10;observations for the randomly chosen genotyped individuals, as well as&#10;observations for the remaining individuals. For this sample the EPS-full&#10;likelihood can be used for model inference.&#10;&#10;In section 5.1 of the main paper we considered extreme exposure&#10;sampling. Then the interest was on the interaction term and individuals&#10;were genotyped due to extreme values of . Since can be regarded as a&#10;constant for the models considered here, the missing-mechanism is also&#10;here MCAR. Therefore, the following discussion can explain why the&#10;EES-full design was found to be only slightly better than the EES-only&#10;design.&#10;&#10; considered a regression model with several covariates, where one&#10;covariate () had a MCAR structure. They considered the difference&#10;between a complete case (CC) approach (only individuals with&#10;observations of were analyzed) and a maximum likelihood (ML) approach&#10;that took into account all available information. They showed that for&#10;estimating the coefficient of , the variance in the estimate was lower&#10;in the ML setting than in the CC setting, when the partial correlation&#10;of and given all other covariates was nonzero, i.e. when the covariate&#10;was independently associated with . Then the power to detect a non-zero&#10;effect of some SNP should be greater in an RS-full sample than in an&#10;RS-only sample. We evaluated this in our main-effects simulation model .&#10;Using the same simulation set-ups as in the main paper, the power&#10;estimates for RS-only and RS-complete were almost identical, as shown in&#10;Table \[tab:simRS\]. The RS-full method was only marginally more&#10;powerful than the RS-only method. Recall that the genetic effect size ()&#10;was chosen to be very low in our simulations. For a particular data set&#10;simulated from model , the partial correlation of and , given and was ,&#10;while the partial correlation of and , given and was . Because the&#10;partial correlation of the genetic variant and the response is close to&#10;zero, by the results of the difference between a method that only&#10;includes the complete cases (RS-only) and a method that includes all&#10;cases (RS-complete) is negligible. To check this results in real data,&#10;we test the -data using the RS-only and RS-full methods. The&#10;corresponding Manhattan plots are presented in Figure&#10;\[fig:manhattanRS\]. We see that the results from RS-full method are&#10;very similar to the RS-only method.">
