    <title>Entanglement witness game</title>
    <abstract>Motivated by Buscemi’s semi-quantum nonlocal game \[PRL 108, 200401
(2012)\], We propose an entanglement witness game, a quantum game based
on entanglement witness. Similar as the semi-quantum nonlocal game, the
existence of entanglement shared by the players is necessary and
sufficient for obtaining a positive average payoff in our entanglement
witness game. Two explicit examples are constructed to demonstrate how
to play our entanglement witness game and its relations with the CHSH
nonlocal game. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Entanglement is a useful resource in quantum information processes. For&#10;example, quantum teleportation is impossible without shared remote&#10;entanglement. What’s the property of entanglement makes it indispensable&#10;in these tasks? It is believed that entanglement has some intriguing&#10;nonlocality, which can be revealed by violating Bell inequalities based&#10;on local Hidden variables. In 1989, however, R.F. Werner discovered that&#10;there are some entanglement states satisfy all Bell inequalities, in&#10;other words, the correlations in these entangled states can be explained&#10;by the Hidden variable model.&#10;&#10;Since Werner’s discovery, a lot of works aimed to explore the subtle&#10;differences between the nonlocality in entanglement and that revealed by&#10;violating Bell inequalities . For instance, the following problem is&#10;raised : are all the entangled states useful in quantum teleportation?&#10;This leads to the discovery of the concept of bound entanglement and the&#10;understanding of the role of entanglement played in quantum&#10;teleportation.&#10;&#10;In another direction, the relation between nonlocal games and Bell&#10;inequalities is built: For any Bell inequality, we can build a nonlocal&#10;game which makes the states violating Bell inequality have a positive&#10;average payoff. According to Werner’s discovery, the entanglement states&#10;satisfying all Bell inequalities will not have a positive average payoff&#10;in any such type of nonlocal game. This makes F. Buscemi put forward a&#10;revised nonlocal game , called semi-quantum nonlocal game, in which the&#10;questions sent to the players are allowed to be represented by&#10;nonorthogonal quantum states. In the semi-quantum nonlocal game, any&#10;entangled state can obtain a positive average payoff while all the&#10;separable states can not.&#10;&#10;In 2013, two groups realize that the semi-quantum nonlocal game can be&#10;used to be measurement-device-independent entanglement witness. In&#10;particular, it shows how to use any entanglement witness to design a&#10;semi-quantum nonlocal game .&#10;&#10;Motivated by the semi-quantum nonlocal game, we propose a simpler&#10;quantum game based on entanglement witness, in which only classical&#10;communications between the referee and the players are allowed, and the&#10;target of our game is the same as: any entangled state can obtain higher&#10;payoff than all separable states.&#10;&#10;Our paper is organized as follows. In section II we briefly review&#10;nonlocal game and semi-quantum nonlocal game . In section III, the main&#10;part of this paper, we propose our entanglement witness game, for&#10;simplicity, we only give the bipartite and tripartite scenario of our&#10;game, but our game can be easily extend to multipartite situations. In&#10;section IV, we give explicit two-qubit examples to show how to play our&#10;entanglement witness game, and it also reveals the relation of our&#10;entanglement witness game with the previous one. Finally, a summary is&#10;given.">

<outline text="Nonlocal game and Semi-quantum nonlocal game" _note="Before discussing our entanglement witness game, we review the&#10;procedures of nonlocal game and semi-quantum nonlocal game, which are&#10;shown in Fig. \[fig1\].&#10;&#10;In these two games, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and one&#10;referee. The referee sends two questions, which are represented by two&#10;quantum states and , to Alice and Bob respectively with a probability&#10;distribution . After obtaining the questions, Alice and Bob make some&#10;local operations to give their answers and respectively with a&#10;conditional probability distribution . Then the referee will pay them&#10;according to a given payoff function .&#10;&#10;In the games, Alice and Bob share a bipartite quantum state , which can&#10;be regarded as the resource of nonlocality. In other words, Alice and&#10;Bob make use of the nonlocality of the state to get the payoff as much&#10;as possible.&#10;&#10;More precisely, Alice and Bob try to choose an optimal to maximize the&#10;average payoff: There are two basic differences between nonlocal game&#10;and semi-nonlocal game. First, and are distinguishable for Alice and&#10;Bob, i.e., they are orthogonal in the nonlocal game; however, we require&#10;the completeness of the states in the operator space but not the&#10;orthogonality in the state space in the semi-nonlocal game.&#10;&#10;Second, the criteria to win the games are different. In nonlocal game,&#10;Alice and Bob win if the payoff outweighs any LHV (Local Hidden&#10;Variables) states and lose otherwise. In the semi-nonlocal game, Alice&#10;and Bob win if the payoff is larger than that from any separable&#10;bipartite quantum state.&#10;&#10;Here it is worthy to emphasize that, before the start of the games,&#10;Alice and Bob are allowed to communicate with each other to work out&#10;some strategies, then the communication is not permitted during the&#10;processes of the games.&#10;&#10;In the two games, without using deterministic strategies, the&#10;conditional probabilities are given based on suitable quantum&#10;measurements.&#10;&#10;In nonlocal game, is where and are the measurement make by Alice and Bob&#10;according to their received labels and of and . Since the construction&#10;of nonlocal game is based on Bell inequality , from the form of Bell&#10;inequality(like CHSH inequality ) we can easily get the desired and .&#10;&#10;In semi-quantum nonlocal game, for any entangled state, the distribution&#10;is written as follows where is the POVM Alice makes on the entangled&#10;state and her received state , and is Bob’s POVM. of entangled states is&#10;out of reach for any separable states, which makes the payoff of any&#10;entangled state larger than separable states.">

<outline text="Our entanglement witness game" _note="In this section, we propose a quantum game to use entanglement as a&#10;resource. To simplify our notations, we assume that is a two-qubit&#10;state.&#10;&#10;The procedure of our entanglement witness game is as follows.&#10;&#10;First, the referee randomly sends the labels to Alice and Bob with&#10;probability ;&#10;&#10;Second, according to labels received from the referee, Alice and Bob do&#10;the following measurements and then Alice and Bob return the measurement&#10;results back to the referee;&#10;&#10;Third, the referee pays them according to the payoff function , where&#10;the referee chooses such that is an entanglement witness of in the case&#10;when is entangled, where , are Pauli matrices.&#10;&#10;Since is the entanglement witness of the entangled state , we have where&#10;is any separable state. Notice that the average payoff which ensures&#10;that only when is entangled the average payoff is positive. Further&#10;more, because there always exists an entanglement witness for any&#10;entangled state , the payoff function based on the entanglement witness&#10;can be constructed, which makes any entanglement can be distinguished in&#10;our game.&#10;&#10;For the referee, the process of our entanglement witness game is a&#10;stochastic tomography of a two-qubit state. When an ensemble of a&#10;two-qubit state is input, the two-qubit state can be reconstructed by&#10;the referee with the answers from Alice and Bob. The entanglement&#10;witness is involved in our game through a proper choice of the payoff&#10;function. Because the entanglement witness is relative to a given&#10;entangled state, the payoff functions may be different for different&#10;entangled states shared by the players. In particular, for any&#10;entanglement state, we only need to adopt a proper entanglement witness&#10;to design the payoff function for our entanglement witness game.&#10;&#10;Different from the traditional nonlocal game, where the player can win&#10;only when they share Bell nonlocal state, our entanglement witness game&#10;gives a positive average payoff if the players share a proper entangled&#10;state (which may not violate any Bell inequality). The reason for this&#10;is that, in the traditional game, the player can choose any two local&#10;measurements, while in our game, they are restricted to the four fixed&#10;measurement operators.&#10;&#10;Our entanglement witness game can be easily extend to multipartite&#10;situations. We use three-qubit scenario to illustrate this. For&#10;tripartite games, there are three players, Alice, Bob and Charlie. The&#10;entanglement witness of three-qubit entangled states can be decomposed&#10;as The same as bipartite scenario, the referee send Alice, Bob and&#10;Charlie four labels , and the players do the measurement of . Then they&#10;send back their binary-outcome results , the referee pay them according&#10;to the payoff function . Then the average payoff would be Only when is a&#10;tripartite entangled state, the payoff is larger than zero.">

<outline text="Explicit Examples: Two-qubit case" _note="In this section, we give two explicit examples to show how to play our&#10;entanglement witness game, and show that Alice and Bob are required to&#10;be honest in our game.&#10;&#10;In the first example, Alice and Bob share the Werner state : where , , .&#10;The entanglement witness of this Werner state is The factor in makes the&#10;projection of into the linear space expanded by is a normalized vector&#10;if we define the inner product for any two Hermitian operators.&#10;&#10;In fact, any two-qubit density matrix is an element in the linear space&#10;expanded by . Since , the component of is . Thus all the two-qubit&#10;density matrices form a convex body in dimensional linear space, where a&#10;general entanglement witness for two-qubit states lies in according to&#10;convex analysis . Usually, it is more convenient to study its subspaces,&#10;e.g., a dimensional subspace, or even a dimensional subspace.&#10;&#10;Here we focus on the dimensional subspace expanded by , and the&#10;projections of two-qubit states and the entanglement witness are shown&#10;in Fig. \[fig2\]. The coordinate for any two-qubit state in this&#10;subspace is given by with . In this subspace, the numerical range  for&#10;all two-qubit states is the regular tetrahedron with vertexes , and the&#10;numerical range for all separable two-qubit states is the octahedron&#10;with vertexes . The gray hyperplane is defined by . The Werner state is&#10;represented by a red line, which intersects with the hyperplane at .&#10;&#10;According to the rule of our entanglement witness game, the average&#10;payoff for the Werner state is which is the geometric distance between&#10;the state and the hyperplane. As we know, is entangled only when . The&#10;above equation shows that when the payoff is larger than zero, which&#10;shows that the entanglement in the Werner state is a useful resource for&#10;our entanglement witness game.&#10;&#10;Here let us explain why Alice and Bob are required to be honest in our&#10;game by an explicit construction. Assume that Alice and Bob share the&#10;classical correlated state with Then they can simulate the correlations&#10;in the entangled state in a scheme discussed by them before the game&#10;starts as follows. When the referee sends , , and to Alice (Bob), Alice&#10;(Bob) measures () respectively. Alice and Bob return the measurement&#10;results to the referee. Then Alice and Bob will get the maximal average&#10;payoff in our game based on the entanglement witness . This construction&#10;shows that the players can get a positive average payoff without shared&#10;entanglement if they are allowed to be dishonest in our entanglement&#10;witness game.&#10;&#10;Another example is from the CHSH inequality, in this example we will&#10;show the relation between the CHSH inequality and our entanglement&#10;witness game. This relation is based on the relation between CHSH&#10;inequality and entanglement witness . The CHSH inequality gives&#10;entanglement witness&#10;&#10;For the Werner state , especially the state when , Alice and Bob&#10;randomly choose their spin observables: Now the CHSH entanglement&#10;witnesses become where a normalized factor is contained.&#10;&#10;Because is related with , which motivates us to consider the dimensional&#10;subspace expanded by them. The similar numerical results are shown in&#10;Fig. \[fig3\]. Now the numerical range for all two-qubit states is the&#10;black square, and the numerical range for all separable two-qubit states&#10;is the blue square. The hyperplanes is the green line, and the Werner&#10;state is denoted as the red line, which intersects with the green line&#10;at .&#10;&#10;In our entanglement witness game, the average payoff is which is the&#10;geometric distance from a Werner state to the green line. When , we&#10;require that . As expected, implies is entangled. However, when , is&#10;entangled but not detected in our entanglement witness game based on the&#10;CHSH inequality, which is consistent with .&#10;&#10;In fact, in our entanglement witness game, we strengthen the CHSH&#10;entanglement witness as which corresponds to a gray line in&#10;Fig. \[fig3\] defined by . The Werner state interact with the gray line&#10;at .&#10;&#10;Then for the Werner state, the average payoff For given by Eq. , the&#10;Bell inequality as entanglement witness can be strengthened as Even&#10;after the strengthen, only the Werner state for is entanglement&#10;witnessed, and the entangled Werner state for is not detected in our&#10;entanglement witness game.&#10;&#10;From the above two typical examples of our entanglement witness game, we&#10;find that the higher dimension of the consider subspace, more entangled&#10;states are useful for our entanglement witness game. An interesting&#10;question to be explored in future arises: what is the lowest dimension&#10;of the subspace to make all entangled states are useful in our&#10;entanglement witness game?">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this paper, we proposed an entanglement witness game, which ensures&#10;any entangled state can have a positive payoff while separable states&#10;can not. The process of our entanglement witness game, in the viewpoint&#10;of the referee, is a stochastic local quantum state tomography, which&#10;makes the referee has the capacity to obtain the entangled state shared&#10;by the players asymptotically. It is worthy to point out if the players&#10;are dishonest, they may get positive average payoff without shared&#10;entanglement, which is not robust as in the semi-nonlocal game.&#10;&#10;Compared with the nonlocal game from the Bell inequalities, any&#10;entangled state is useful in our entanglement witness game, while in the&#10;traditional one, only the entangled states violating Bell inequalities&#10;has advantage over separable states. Compared with the semi-quantum&#10;nonlocal game, we do not need quantum channels to transfer&#10;non-orthogonal quantum states from the referee to the players. In&#10;addition, the procedure is relative simpler than the previous ones, and&#10;it is more directly based on entanglement witness. Our entanglement&#10;witness game can use any entangled state as a resource by adopting its&#10;entanglement witness to design the payoff function, and it can be&#10;implemented similarly as the entanglement witness experiments .&#10;&#10;We hope our work will increase our understandings on Bell nonlocality&#10;and entanglement through different quantum games, and promote their&#10;applications in quantum information processes.&#10;&#10;This work is supported by NSF of China (Grant No. 11475254)(BNKBRSF of&#10;China (Grant No. 2014CB921202), and The National Key Research and&#10;Development Program of China(Grant No. 2016YFA0300603).">
