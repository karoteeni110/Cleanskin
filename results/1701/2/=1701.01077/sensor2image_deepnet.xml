    <title>Transforming Sensor Data to the Image Domain for Deep Learning - an
Application to Footstep Detection</title>
    <abstract>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art in
various computer vision tasks, but they are still premature for most
sensor data, especially in pervasive and wearable computing. A major
reason for this is the limited amount of annotated training data. In
this paper, we propose the idea of leveraging the discriminative power
of pre-trained deep CNNs on 2-dimensional sensor data by transforming
the sensor modality to the visual domain. By three proposed strategies,
2D sensor output is converted into pressure distribution imageries. Then
we utilize a pre-trained CNN for transfer learning on the converted
imagery data. We evaluate our method on a gait dataset of floor surface
pressure mapping. We obtain a classification accuracy of 87.66%, which
outperforms the conventional machine learning methods by over 10%. </abstract>
