<outline text="Pressure Sensor Data" _note="The dataset taken up for this research is taken from our previous work ,&#10;which consists of the step samples of 13 people who walk on a pressure&#10;sensitive matrix. Each person in each walking sequence records 2-3&#10;steps. A minimum of 12 such samples is recorded for each person. The&#10;demography of participants varies in terms of height, weight, and&#10;shoe-size from 155-195 (in cm), 64-100 (in Kg), and 37-45 (European&#10;size) respectively. This accounts for the high variance in the recorded&#10;data. Each walking sequence is an individual data sequence, labeled with&#10;a specific person ID which defines the class label for the CNN. Overall,&#10;529 steps are recorded.">
