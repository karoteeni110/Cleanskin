<outline text="Related Work" _note="The outlier analysis problem has been studied extensively in the&#10;literature . Numerous algorithms have been proposed in the literature&#10;for outlier detection of conventional multidimensional data . The key&#10;methods, which are used frequently for outlier analysis include&#10;distance-based methods , density-based methods , and subspace methods .&#10;In distance-based methods, data points are declared outliers, when they&#10;are situated far away from the dense regions in the underlying data.&#10;Typically, indexing or other summarization schemes may be used in order&#10;to improve the efficiency of the approach. In density-based methods ,&#10;data points with low local density with respect to the remaining points&#10;are declared outliers. In addition, a number of subspace methods have&#10;been proposed recently, in which outliers are defined on the basis of&#10;subspace behavior of the underlying data.&#10;&#10;Most of the traditional multidimensional methods can also be extended to&#10;text data, though they are not particularly suited to the latter. Some&#10;methods have been designed for outlier detection with matrix&#10;factorization in network data sets , that are not applicable to text&#10;data. Text data is uniquely difficult because of its sparse and high&#10;dimensional nature. As a result, many of the outliers detected using&#10;conventional methods may simply correspond to noisy text segments.&#10;Therefore, careful modeling is required with the use of matrix&#10;factorization methods.&#10;&#10;Over the last decade, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has&#10;emerged as another important low rank approximation technique, where the&#10;low-rank factor matrices are constrained to have only non-negative&#10;elements. Lee and Seung introduced a multiplicative update based low&#10;rank approximation with non-negative factors to overcome the challenges&#10;of truncated SVD. Subsequent to this work, NMF has received enormous&#10;attention and has been successfully applied to a broad range of&#10;important problems in areas including computer vision, community&#10;detection in social networks, visualization, recommender systems&#10;bioinformatics, etc. In spite of broad range of applications, NMF’s&#10;literature in text domain is scarce. Xu [ET. AL.]{} experimented with&#10;NMF for document clustering instead of SVD based Latent Semantic&#10;Indexing (LSI). Other than applications of NMF in the text domain,&#10;Gaussier and Goutte established the equivalence between NMF and pLSA.&#10;Similarly, Ding [ET. AL.]{} explained the equivalence between NMF and&#10;pLSI.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we use an NMF approach for concise modelling of the&#10;patterns, the background, and the anomalies in the underlying data. It&#10;should be pointed out that NMF is similar to the generative models of&#10;text such as pLSI and LDA , though NMF often provides better&#10;interpretability. Our important challenge is to model the outliers along&#10;with the low rank space of the input matrix. We identified -norm as an&#10;appropriate approach for factorization in outlier analysis. Recently,&#10;the researchers have used -norm in their models to solve various&#10;problems, though the corresponding solution techniques are not easily&#10;generalizable to the -norm. Yang et.al., , under the assumption that the&#10;class label of input data can be predicted by a linear classifier,&#10;incorporate discriminative analysis and -norm minimization into a joint&#10;framework for unsupervised feature selection problem. Similarly, Liu [ET&#10;AL]{} , solve -norm regularized regression model for joint feature&#10;selection from multiple tasks. They also propose to use Nesterov’s&#10;method to solve the optimization problem with non-smooth -norm&#10;regularization. Also, Kong [ET AL]{} propose a robust formulation of NMF&#10;using -norm loss function for data with noises.">

<outline text="Our Contributions" _note="Text data is uniquely challenging to outlier detection both because of&#10;its sparsity and high dimensional nature. Given the relevant literature&#10;for NMF and text outliers, we propose the first approach to detect&#10;outliers in text data using non-negative matrix factorization. We extend&#10;the fact that NMF is similar to pLSI and LDA generative models and model&#10;the outliers using the -norm. This particular formulation of NMF is&#10;non-standard, and requires careful design of optimization methods to&#10;solve the problem. We solve the resulting optimization problem using&#10;block coordinate descent technique. We also present extensive&#10;experimental results both on text and other kinds of market basket data&#10;sets. We show significant improvements achieved by the approach over&#10;other baseline methods.">
