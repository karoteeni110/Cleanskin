<outline text="Introduction" _note="The problem of outlier detection is that of finding data points which&#10;are unusually different from the rest of the data set. Such outliers are&#10;also variously referred to as anomalies, deviants, discordants or&#10;abnormalities in the data. Since outliers correspond to unusual&#10;observations, they are often of interest to the analyst in finding&#10;interesting anomalies in the underlying generating process. The problem&#10;of outlier analysis is applicable to a wide variety of domains such as&#10;machine monitoring, financial markets, environmental modeling and social&#10;network analysis. Correspondingly, the problem has been studied in the&#10;context of different data types which arise in these domains, such as&#10;multidimensional data, spatial data, and discrete sequences. Numerous&#10;books and surveys have been written on the problem of outlier detection&#10;.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we will study the problem of text outlier analysis. The&#10;problem of text outlier analysis has become increasingly important&#10;because of the greater prevalence of web-centric and social media&#10;applications, which are rich in text data. Some important applications&#10;of text outlier analysis are as follows:&#10;&#10;[WEB SITE MANAGEMENT:]{} An unusual page from a set of articles in a web&#10;site may be flagged as an outlier. The knowledge of such outliers may be&#10;used for web site management.&#10;&#10;[SPARSE HIGH DIMENSIONAL DATA:]{} While the methods discussed in this&#10;paper have text applications in mind, they can be used for other sparse&#10;high dimensional domains. For example, such methods can be used for&#10;market basket data sets. Unusual transactions may sometimes provide an&#10;idea of fraudulent behaviour.&#10;&#10;[NEWS ARTICLE MANAGEMENT:]{} It is often desirable to determine unusual&#10;news article from a collection of news documents. An unusual news from a&#10;group of articles may be flagged as an interesting outlier.&#10;&#10;While text is an extremely important domain from the perspective of&#10;outlier analysis, there are surprisingly few methods which are&#10;[SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED]{} on this domain, even though many generic&#10;methods such as distance-based methods can be easily adapted to this&#10;domain , and are often used for text outlier analysis. Domains such as&#10;text are particularly challenging for the problem of outlier analysis,&#10;because of their sparse high dimensional nature, in which only a small&#10;fraction of the words take on non-zero values. Furthermore, many words&#10;in a document may be topically irrelevant to the context of the document&#10;and add to the noise in the distance computations. For example, the word&#10;“[JAGUAR]{}” may correspond to a car, or a cat depending on the context&#10;of the document. In particular, the significance of a word can be&#10;interpreted only in terms of the structure of the data within the&#10;context of a particular data locality. As a result, document-to-document&#10;similarity measures often lose their robustness. Thus, commonly used&#10;outlier analysis methods for multidimensional data, such as&#10;distance-based methods, are not particularly effective for text data.&#10;Our experiments also validate this observation.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we will use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)&#10;methods to address the aforementioned challenges in text anomaly&#10;detection. One advantage of matrix factorization methods is that they&#10;decompose the term-document structure of the underlying corpus into a&#10;set of semantic term clusters and document clusters. The semantic nature&#10;of this decomposition provides the context in which a document may be&#10;interpreted for outlier analysis. Thus, documents can be decomposed into&#10;word clusters, and words are decomposed into document clusters with a&#10;low-rank[^1] approximation. Outliers are therefore defined as data&#10;points which cannot be naturally expressed in terms of this&#10;decomposition. By using carefully chosen model formulations, one can&#10;further sharpen the matrix-factorization method to reveal&#10;document-centric outliers. One challenge in this case, is that the&#10;design of a matrix factorization approach, which is optimized to anomaly&#10;detection, results in a non-standard formulation. Therefore, we will&#10;design an optimization solution for this model. The NMF model also has&#10;the advantage of providing better interpretability, and it can also&#10;provide insights into why a document should be considered an outlier. We&#10;present extensive experimental results on many data sets, and compare&#10;against a variety of baseline methods. We show significant improvements&#10;achieved by the approach over a variety of other methods.&#10;&#10;This paper is organized as follows. The remainder of this section&#10;discusses the related work. Section \[sec:model\] introduces the model&#10;for outlier analysis. The algorithm to solve this model is provided in&#10;section \[sec:algorithm\]. Section \[sec:experimentation\] provides the&#10;experimental results. The conclusions and summary are contained in&#10;section \[sec:conclusion\]. Our code can be downloaded from&#10;&lt;https://github.com/ramkikannan/outliernmf&gt; and tried with any text&#10;dataset.&#10;&#10;[^1]: In this paper, we use the terms “low rank approximation” and&#10;    “matrix factorization” interchangeably. Similarly, we used the terms&#10;    “anomalies” and “outliers” interchangeably.">
