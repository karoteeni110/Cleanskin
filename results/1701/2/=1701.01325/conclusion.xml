<outline text="Conclusion" _note="This paper presents a matrix factorization based approach to text&#10;outlier analysis. The approach is designed to adjust well to the widely&#10;varying structures in different localities of the data, and therefore&#10;provides more robust methods than competing models. The approach has the&#10;potential to be applied to other domains with similar structure, and as&#10;a specific example, we provide experiments on market basket data. We&#10;also presented extensive experimental results, which illustrate the&#10;superiority of the approach. Our code can be downloaded from&#10;&lt;https://github.com/ramkikannan/outliernmf&gt; and tried with any text&#10;dataset.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we had a parallel implementation using the Matlabâ€™s&#10;parallel computing toolbox to run in multicore environments. In the&#10;future, we would like to explore a scalable implementation of our&#10;algorithm. The solution is embarrassingly parallelizable, and would like&#10;to experiment in web scale data. One of the potential extension is&#10;incorporating temporal and spatial aspects into the model. Such an&#10;extension, make the solution applicable to emerging applications such as&#10;topic detection and streaming data. We experimented the solution&#10;primarily on text data and market basket data. In future work, we will&#10;extend this broader approach to other domains such as video data.">
