    <title>Examples of renormalized SDEs</title>
    <abstract>We demonstrate two examples of stochastic processes whose lifts to
geometric rough paths require a renormalisation procedure to obtain
convergence in rough path topologies. Our first example involves a
physical Brownian motion subject to a magnetic force which dominates
over the friction forces in the small mass limit. Our second example
involves a lead-lag process of discretised fractional Brownian motion
with Hurst parameter , in which the stochastic area captures the
quadratic variation of the process. In both examples, a renormalisation
of the second iterated integral is needed to ensure convergence of the
processes, and we comment on how this procedure mimics negative
renormalisation arising in the study of singular SPDEs and regularity
structures. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In recent years, the theory of regularity structures  has been proposed&#10;to give meaning to a wide class of singular SPDEs. A central feature of&#10;the theory is the notion of renormalisation, specifically “negative&#10;renormalisation” , which is required to obtain convergence of random&#10;models to a meaningful limit. It is well-known that this procedure is&#10;inherit to the problem since naive approximations of such equations&#10;typically fail to converge (with a number of notable exceptions,&#10;including a special variant of gKPZ ). The same feature thus naturally&#10;appears in other solution theories which have been proposed to solve&#10;such equations, including the theories of paracontrolled distributions &#10;and the Wilsonian renormalisation group .&#10;&#10;Viewing regularity structures as a multidimensional generalisation of&#10;the theory of rough paths , it is natural to ask how renormalisation&#10;manifests itself in the latter. As solution theories to singular&#10;S(P)DEs, both share the common feature that one must give meaning to&#10;often analytically ill-posed higher order terms (iterated integrals) of&#10;distributions, which is typically done through some stochastic means.&#10;However, a key difference in applications of rough paths to SDEs and&#10;rough SPDEs  is that one can usually give meaning to such terms as&#10;limits of iterated integrals of mollifications of the irregular noise&#10;without the need of renormalisation.&#10;&#10;The purpose of this note is to demonstrate situations in rough paths&#10;theory which fall outside this usual setting and for which&#10;renormalisation is a necessary feature. Specifically, we construct two&#10;stochastic processes whose lifts to geometric rough paths fail to&#10;converge without a renormalisation procedure akin to the one encountered&#10;in the theory of regularity structures.&#10;&#10;The first is a physical Brownian motion subject to a magnetic force&#10;which dominates over the friction forces in the small mass limit. This&#10;example builds on the work , where a similar situation was considering&#10;with a constant magnetic field.&#10;&#10;The second is a lead-lag process of a discretized path, which we take to&#10;be fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter . The stochastic area&#10;of this lead-lag process captures the quadratic variation of the&#10;discretized path, and thus, as one can expect, the second iterated&#10;integral fails to converge as the mesh of the discretisation goes to&#10;zero (unless ). This example is motivated from a similar Hoff process&#10;considered for semi-martinagles in .&#10;&#10;In both examples we demonstrate an explicit renormalisation procedure of&#10;the second iterated integral under which the processes converge in rough&#10;path topologies. These (diverging) counter-terms serve precisely the&#10;same re-centring role encountered in regularity structures (for a direct&#10;comparison, consider the renormalisation of PAM  where only one&#10;diverging term needs to be considered). In turn, rough differential&#10;equations driven by the renormalised and unrenormalised rough paths are&#10;related to one another by the addition of diverging terms, which again&#10;mimics the situation encountered in singular SPDEs. We refer to the&#10;upcoming work  for a much more detailed study of this relation.&#10;&#10;[**Acknowledgements.**]{} P.K.F. is partially supported by the European&#10;Research Council through CoG-683166 and DFG research unit FOR2402.
