    <title>Charged rotating BTZ black holes in noncommutative spaces\
and torsion gravity</title>
    <abstract>We consider charged rotating BTZ black holes in noncommutative space by
use of Chern-Simons theory formulation of dimensional gravity. The
noncommutativity between the radial and the angular variables is
introduced through the Seiberg-Witten map for gauge fields, and the
deformed geometry to the first order in the noncommutative parameter is
derived. It is found that the deformation also induces nontrivial
torsion, and the Einstein-Cartan theory appears to be a suitable
framework to investigate the equations of motion. Though the deformation
is indeed nontrivial, the deformed and the original Einstein equations
are found to be related by a rather simple coordinate transformation. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="It is widely believed that at a very high energy scale, such as Planck&#10;or the string scale, the notion of smooth geometry is no longer valid&#10;due to the effect of quantum gravity; namely quantum fluctuation of&#10;spacetime itself becomes significant and may not be treated as&#10;perturbation around a classical geometry. Though we have not yet fully&#10;understand such a [QUANTUM GEOMETRY]{}, among those available proposals,&#10;the noncommutative geometry may capture some desired features of it. In&#10;the quantum geometry, space-time coordinates are no longer regarded as&#10;-numbers but the ones obeying a specific quantum algebra, which&#10;naturally introduces a length scale serving as the UV cutoff. Quantum&#10;field theory formulated on a noncommutative geometry also exhibits&#10;various intriguing behaviors such as the UV/IR mixing and stringy&#10;properties .&#10;&#10;The rich structure emerged in noncommutative quantum field theory has&#10;enticed several proposals to consider gravitational theory on&#10;noncommutative space . Although it is not easy to investigate concrete&#10;solutions due to their complicated structures, gravity in dimensions may&#10;be an exception. For instance, the Poisson brackets of were studied in&#10;Ref. and families of deformation were found leading to a discrete&#10;spectrum for time operator. In Ref., an effective metric of a&#10;noncommutative geometry was sourced by delocalized mass and charges due&#10;to the minimal length. In addition, gravity is known to have a&#10;description in terms of Chern-Simons theory . In this case, one may take&#10;advantage of the Seiberg-Witten map that relates a theory on commutative&#10;space to a corresponding theory on a noncommutative space. To mention a&#10;few examples: the authors of used the Seiberg-Witten map to modify&#10;algebraic relation. They found no first order correction as expected in&#10;the canonical treatment in the noncommutative geometry, as long as&#10;classical torsion is excluded. In Ref., the ambiguity in the metric due&#10;to gauge transformation was discussed and fixed by introducing&#10;nonminimal coupled scalars and a nontrivial potential. In Ref., it was&#10;argued that cosmological constant got quantized in the noncommutative&#10;Chern-Simons gravity.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space&#10;admits the well-known black hole solution and its charged counterpart .&#10;In Ref., a constant gauge field was introduced in coupled with the&#10;Chern-Simon action and it amounted to mix mass and angular momentum in&#10;the original BTZ. In Ref., a noncommutative deformation in polar&#10;coordinates was introduced via the Seiberg-Witten map and a&#10;noncommutative neutral BTZ black hole metric up to the first order in&#10;(noncommutative parameter) was obtained. However, this result appeared&#10;in conflict with that in Ref. for its first order correction in metric.&#10;Before we could solve the puzzle, it is useful to review their&#10;construction.&#10;&#10;In Ref., a noncommutative deformation of a neutral rotating BTZ black&#10;hole solution is investigated based on a commutation relation in the&#10;polar coordinates, that is, .[^1] The solution is written in terms of&#10;Chern-Simons gauge fields and the noncommutative deformation is&#10;introduced by the Seiberg-Witten map. The resultant metric, to the first&#10;order in , reads [^2] with where represents the horizon radius of the&#10;undeformed metric (the explicit forms are given in the Appendix&#10;\[sec:conventions\]). The noncommutative extension requires two extra&#10;gauge fields , which are chosen as with a constant . Some properties of&#10;this deformed black hole solution are investigated in Ref., for&#10;instance, the locations of various types of horizon.&#10;&#10;We, however, confirm that this metric satisfies the vacuum Einstein&#10;equation to the first order, , if the corrections of the metric in Ref.&#10;are taken into account. This fact suggests that there should exist&#10;another coordinate system in which the metric looks like a pure AdS. It&#10;turns out that, indeed, by making a coordinate transformation and only&#10;keeping terms up to first order in , the metric comes back to the&#10;undeformed BTZ black hole solution; namely the first order correction&#10;can be eliminated.[^3] The angular part of the metric becomes , where is&#10;regarded as a standard radial coordinate. Consequently, the deformed BTZ&#10;black hole and the undeformed one are [EQUIVALENT]{} up to the&#10;coordinate transformation . We remark that while the change is only made&#10;in , the geometrical structure near the boundary would not be changed&#10;since and are asymptotically the same. Thus, various mechanical and&#10;thermodynamic properties of black holes, such as the Hawking&#10;temperature, entropy, and orbital motion of particles, appear to be&#10;equivalent. This equivalence may attribute to the fact that the vacuum&#10;solution of dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant is&#10;essentially unique. This motivates us to investigate a different class&#10;of solutions that are not vacuum solutions. In this paper, we shall&#10;explore the charged rotating BTZ black hole solution in a noncommutative&#10;space.&#10;&#10;The organization of the paper is as follows: In the&#10;Sec.\[sec:NC\_gravity\], a noncommutative deformation is formulated by&#10;use of the Seiberg-Witten map in the Chern-Simons framework of&#10;dimensional gravity. We start with a charged rotating BTZ solution and&#10;obtain deformed gauge fields, vielbeins, and spin connections. In the&#10;Sec.\[sec:nonc-charg-rotat\], we investigate the properties of&#10;noncommutative charged rotating BTZ black hole solutions. There appears&#10;nontrivial torsion and the deformed equations of motion are found to be&#10;nicely fitted in to the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory of torsion&#10;gravity. The relation between the deformed and the original solutions&#10;through a coordinate change is expounded. We conclude the paper with&#10;discussion and overview in the Sec.\[sec:conclusion\]. The appendices&#10;are given to summarize our convention and to explain more technical&#10;details.&#10;&#10;[^1]: We will review the noncommutativity deformation in more detail in&#10;    Sec.\[sec:NC\_gravity\].&#10;&#10;[^2]: We have corrected the sign mistakes in and parts in Ref..&#10;&#10;[^3]: There is a subtle issue about the regions covered by these&#10;    coordinates, which will be discussed in the&#10;    Sec.\[sec:coordinate-change\].">

  <outline text="Coupling of matter fields to noncommutative gravity" _note="Here we briefly discuss the coupling of the Abelian gauge field to the&#10;noncommutative gauge field . The straightforward extension of Maxwell&#10;action reads where the products between fields are understood to be the&#10;star product, and the field strength is defined as with being a&#10;noncommutative extension of gauge field. The metric is given by the&#10;noncommutative extension of vielbeins, . As a result, the Maxwell action&#10;is highly nonlinear in terms of .&#10;&#10;On top of this nonlinearlity, the standard Maxwell action in a curved&#10;background poses a question: general coordinate transformation is given&#10;by a field dependent gauge transformation and this action is in general&#10;not fully gauge invariant. If we want to maintain the full gauge&#10;invariance, we need to write the matter part coupling in terms of and in&#10;such a way that the obtained action keeps gauge invariance intact and&#10;also comes back to in the commutative limit. This is a fairly nontrivial&#10;problem without immediate answer. We thus take the following strategy:&#10;the noncommutative gravity is introduced via the Seiberg-Witten map in&#10;the formulation of Chern-Simons theory, while the matter part is treated&#10;as being coupled to the noncommutative gravity through the gravitational&#10;degrees of freedom, namely, , (torsion), and instead of .[^1]&#10;&#10;We may try to write down possible coupling terms, which are classified&#10;by the numbers of derivatives and torsion tensors. It is known that&#10;gauge field cannot minimally couple to torsion in a gauge-invariant way,&#10;therefore we shall consider the non-minimal coupling. The possible terms&#10;of lower dimensions are (we omit the symbol of the star product) where&#10;the first term is gauge invariant up to a surface term. The tensor is&#10;torsion dependent and reads, where is the torsion vector (the trace of&#10;torsion), , and . Note that for and the order of indices is important.&#10;Here, only the terms up to mass dimension 2 are presented.

  <outline text="Seiberg-Witten map" _note="The Seiberg-Witten map is introduced as a map between gauge theories on&#10;commutative and noncommutative geometries. As shown in Ref.,&#10;Chern-Simons theory has a peculiar feature under the map; the form of&#10;the action remains unchanged (up to surface terms), and we can simply&#10;replace the ordinary products with the Moyal products. This property&#10;suggests that at least for the part of Chern-Simons action, a solution&#10;for the equations of motion can be mapped into its noncommutative&#10;counterpart.&#10;&#10;We now consider the Seiberg-Witten map based on the radius-angle&#10;commutation relation where .

  <outline text="-deformed metric" _note="In Sec.\[sec:NC\_gravity\], we have derived the noncommutative&#10;Chern-Simons gauge fields –.

When one applies&#10;the same change of coordinates as in , the metric recovers the&#10;undeformed one with replaced by . This implies that the Einstein&#10;equation is satisfied if we apply the same coordinate transformation to&#10;the right hand side ( the gauge field energy-momentum tensor)&#10;simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Now we would like to investigate the change of coordinates and the&#10;Einstein equation more closely.

Since torsion transforms as a&#10;genuine tensor, this solution cannot be related to the undeformed one&#10;with vanishing torsion by a mere coordinate change.&#10;&#10;The theory of gravity with torsion is known as Einstein-Cartan theory of&#10;gravitation. Some features of Einstein-Cartan theory are briefly&#10;summarized in the App.\[sec:einst-cart-theory\].

Since the left hand side&#10;is nonvanishing, the matter part of the action should also be modified&#10;such that it couples to torsion.

  <outline text="Coordinate change" _note="Finally, we briefly comment on the change of coordinates . There is a&#10;subtle point on the regions that the radial coordinate covers. Recall&#10;that covers and it has one-to-one correspondence to the region . Except&#10;for the vicinity of center in the deformed geometry, , it can be mapped&#10;to the undeformed geometry. Now we investigate the angular part of the&#10;metric, namely or . In the deformed metric, the radial coordinate makes&#10;sense only for the region . Therefore, in the deformed geometry, there&#10;appears an effective minimum length scale . This may not be so&#10;surprising; in the current formulation, the noncommutative parameter&#10;appears only in the combination of and we learn that serves a&#10;characteristic length scale in the noncommutative geometry. Now let be&#10;the location of the horizon of noncommutative BTZ measured in&#10;coordinate, that is, the largest root of . As long as , we can see the&#10;correspondence to the undeformed BTZ solution. On the other hand, a&#10;black hole of the size is not well-defined in the noncommutative side.&#10;&#10;Finally, we comment on a subtle issue on the coordinate invariance of&#10;noncommutative gravity.[^1] The action of noncommutative gravity, by&#10;using Chern-Simons formulation, is invariant under a deformed coordinate&#10;transformation, which is reduced to the usual diffeomorphism in the&#10;commutative limit . As studied in Ref., two noncommutative theories&#10;obtained by the Seiberg-Witten map with the rectangular and polar&#10;coordinates are distinct; this implies that we cannot map one to the&#10;other by a simple coordinate change in the noncommutative theory. In the&#10;present case, the situation is much simpler; the change is only for the&#10;radial coordinate and it does not change the noncommutative algebra&#10;(unlike the change between the rectangular and polar coordinates&#10;discussed in Ref.), On top of that, all the relevant function in the&#10;metric depends only on . In other words, the noncommutativity is&#10;irrelevant when we consider a deformed coordinate transform (star&#10;product simply reduces to ordinary product), and the transformed&#10;solution satisfies the conventional Einstein equation. Together with the&#10;uniqueness of local solution for the vacuum case, this could be the very&#10;reason why the deformed solution is related to the undeformed one by the&#10;coordinate change . In the case of Einstein-Maxwell theory, since&#10;solutions do not have to be unique and a noncommutative extension&#10;involves nontrivial torsion, we cannot see immediately why the simple&#10;relation still holds. It may be related to the fact that since the&#10;functions in the commutative solution only involve the radial coordinate&#10;, it could be sufficient to consider a commutative version of&#10;Einstein-Cartan theory while we only concern the equation of motion. We&#10;expect a simple coordinate change like becomes impossible for a generic&#10;geometry whose metric functions depend on both and coordinates. We,&#10;however, leave this complexity for future studies.&#10;&#10;[^1]: We thank an anonymous referee to raise this point.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this paper, we have explored the charged rotating BTZ black hole&#10;geometry by use of Chern-Simons formulation in dimensional gravity and&#10;the Seiberg-Witten map.&#10;&#10;The noncommutativity in question is the one between the radial&#10;coordinate and the angular coordinate, namely . The noncommutative&#10;deformation for the pure gravity part is introduced by the&#10;Seiberg-Witten map for the Chern-Simons gauge fields where two extra&#10;gauge fields are added. The deformation for the matter gauge field part&#10;is to be determined to satisfy the deformed equations of motion.&#10;&#10;It is found that as with the neutral case, the deformed metric is&#10;related to the undeformed one via a simple coordinate transformation.&#10;Through this observation, we discover that the deformation of the matter&#10;energy-momentum tensor can also be obtained by the same coordinate&#10;change. Nevertheless, there appears nonvanishing torsion that is&#10;proportional to the noncommutativity parameter and it cannot be&#10;eliminated by a coordinate change. We thus analyze the equations of&#10;motion in the framework of Einstein-Cartan torsion gravity. It is found&#10;that with the same deformed matter energy-momentum tensor, the equations&#10;of motion derived from torsion gravity are also satisfied. Though we&#10;have not yet fixed the action of deformed matter completely, a set of&#10;conditions for the correction term are presented.&#10;&#10;There are several issues to be clarified. Firstly, we do not fully&#10;understand why the noncommutative deformation is represented by a simple&#10;change of the radial coordinate. One can verify that the result of the&#10;Seiberg-Witten map for the difference of the gauge fields, say , can be&#10;obtained by the same coordinate change, however the sum is not.&#10;Therefore, the deformed vielbeins are related to the undeformed ones via&#10;the coordinate change, however the spin connections are not. This subtle&#10;difference leads to the nontrivial torsion in the deformed background.&#10;One may argue that the gauge field representation has some nonphyiscal&#10;degrees of freedom, but the appearance of torsion is physical and cannot&#10;be trivially eliminated by the coordinate change.&#10;&#10;We observe that the matter gauge field couples to after the deformation.&#10;In Ref., the authors argued that in the noncommutative Chern-Simons&#10;theory there is a coupling term between and torsion. One thus may guess&#10;that the coupling to torsion appears via . We remark that the&#10;noncommutative extension of torsion constructed in Ref. cosnsists of two&#10;parts: a standard part (which we call torsion in this paper) and a term&#10;like (which trivially vanishes in the commutative limit). However,&#10;couples only to the latter. Therefore, the coupling between the&#10;geometrical part of torsion to the other degrees of freedom remains&#10;unclear.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the admitted minimal black holes discussed in the Sec.&#10;\[sec:coordinate-change\] may imply that the noncommutative space-time&#10;has its own entropy, i.e. in a region of Planckian size, presuming the&#10;area law still applies. This reminds us of the spin foam model in the&#10;loop quantum gravity and we wonder if counts the spin combination.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, it is curious which properties of the charged BTZ black hole&#10;are changed or unchanged after the deformation. The torsion may affect&#10;the property of black holes through the change of metric . However, in&#10;our case as long as we look at the metric only, we do not see the&#10;difference. It is interesting to see whether this is a peculiar feature&#10;of the current solution, or this may happen in a broader setup of&#10;dimensional gravity with noncommutativity. On top of that, it should&#10;also be important to fix the deformation of the matter part action and&#10;examine how the matter part action couples to the torsion or the extra&#10;gauge fields .&#10;&#10;Finally, we would like to comment on results made in Ref., where&#10;noncommutative structures, including Lie algebraic structure ones, are&#10;considered in dimensional gravity. It was argued that the first order&#10;correction vanishes under the condition of vanishing classical torsion.&#10;In our construction, however, we include a matter field whose&#10;deformation is not completely fixed by the Seiberg-Witten map and the&#10;deformed solution has nontrivial torsion. Therefore, our result would&#10;not be immediately contradict to their results. Since there appears a&#10;simple relation between the deformed geometry with torsion and the&#10;undeformed one, it is interesting to investigate the applicability of&#10;our argument to generic backgrounds in torsion gravity.&#10;&#10;**Note added:** Upon completing this work, there appeared a paper ,&#10;which considered a noncommutative deformation in four dimensional&#10;gravity. They also observed the emergence of torsion.">

For some overview of&#10;torsion gravity, see Ref..&#10;&#10;The vielbeins relate to the metric by , where , and its inverse is and .&#10;With spin connections , Affine connections are defined by and the&#10;torsion tensor is The curvature tensor is and the Ricci tensor and the&#10;scalar curvature are defined by and respectively.&#10;&#10;In Einstein-Cartan theory of torsion gravity, the metric and the&#10;connection are treated as independent variables. When we consider the&#10;equations of motion, we can take the variation of torsion tensor instead&#10;of the connection. The action is given by the usual Einstein-Hilbert&#10;form, and its variations give where with being a covariant derivative&#10;and the trace of the torsion tensor . The contorsion tensor is defined&#10;as and is known as the deformed torsion tensor:&#10;&#10;Finally, by use of the one forms and , the torsion and the curvature two&#10;forms are written as&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;For example, H. S. Snyder, “Quantized space-time,” Phys. Rev. &#10;[**71**]{} (1947) 38. doi:10.1103/PhysRev.71.38;\&#10;A. Connes, M. R. Douglas and A. S. Schwarz, “Noncommutative geometry and&#10;matrix theory: Compactification on tori,” JHEP [**9802**]{} (1998) 003&#10;doi:10.1088/1126-6708/1998/02/003 \[hep-th/9711162\];\&#10;J. Madore, “The Fuzzy sphere,” Class. Quant. Grav.  [**9**]{} (1992) 69.&#10;doi:10.1088/0264-9381/9/1/008&#10;&#10;S. Minwalla, M. Van Raamsdonk and N. Seiberg, “Noncommutative&#10;perturbative dynamics,” JHEP [**0002**]{} (2000) 020&#10;doi:10.1088/1126-6708/2000/02/020 \[hep-th/9912072\].&#10;&#10;T. Yoneya, “String theory and space-time uncertainty principle,”&#10;Prog. Theor. Phys.  [**103**]{}, 1081 (2000) doi:10.1143/PTP.103.1081&#10;\[hep-th/0004074\].&#10;&#10;For example, E. Harikumar and V. O. Rivelles, “Noncommutative Gravity,”&#10;Class. Quant. Grav.  [**23**]{}, 7551 (2006)&#10;doi:10.1088/0264-9381/23/24/024 \[hep-th/0607115\].\&#10;G. Fucci and I. G. Avramidi, “Noncommutative Einstein Equations,”&#10;Class. Quant. Grav.  [**25**]{}, 025005 (2008)&#10;doi:10.1088/0264-9381/25/2/025005 \[arXiv:0709.0015 \[gr-qc\]\].\&#10;M. Chaichian, M. Oksanen, A. Tureanu and G. Zet, “Gauging the twisted&#10;Poincare symmetry as noncommutative theory of gravitation,” Phys. Rev. D&#10;[**79**]{}, 044016 (2009) doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.79.044016&#10;\[arXiv:0807.0733 \[hep-th\]\].\&#10;M. Kober, “Canonical Noncommutativity Algebra for the Tetrad Field in&#10;General Relativity,” Class. Quant. Grav.  [**28**]{}, 225021 (2011)&#10;doi:10.1088/0264-9381/28/22/225021 \[arXiv:1107.1071 \[hep-th\]\].\&#10;M. Kober, “Canonical quantum gravity on noncommutative space-time,”&#10;Int. J. Mod. Phys. A [**30**]{}, no. 17, 1550085 (2015)&#10;doi:10.1142/S0217751X15500852 \[arXiv:1409.1751 \[gr-qc\]\].&#10;&#10;B. P. Dolan, K. S. Gupta and A. Stern, “Noncommutative BTZ black hole&#10;and discrete time,” Class. Quant. Grav.  [**24**]{}, 1647 (2007)&#10;doi:10.1088/0264-9381/24/6/017 \[hep-th/0611233\].
