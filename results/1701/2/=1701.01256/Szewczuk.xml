<outline text="Introduction" _note="KIC7760680 was classified as the Slowly Pulsating B-type star by&#10;P[á]{}pics et al. who found a series of 36 frequencies quasi-equally&#10;spaced in period from the Kepler photometry. From spectroscopic&#10;observations the authors derived the effective temperature, K, surface&#10;gravity, , metallicity, (which correspond to about ) and the minimum&#10;value of the rotational velocity, kms. Based on the zero-rotation&#10;asymptotic theory, P[á]{}pics et al. attributed these frequencies to the&#10;prograde dipole gravity modes of high consecutive radial orders.&#10;Recently, Moravveji et al. made a detailed seismic modelling of the star&#10;taking into account effects of rotation in the framework of the&#10;traditional approximation applied to the non-rotating MESA evolutionary&#10;models. The authors found that KIC7760680 is a moderately rotating star&#10;with the rotational frequency amounting to 26% of its Roche break up&#10;frequency (0.4805 d) and with a mass . Furthermore, they constrained the&#10;exponentially decaying convective core overshooting parameter to .&#10;Additionally, their best seismic models employed extra diffusive mixing&#10;in the radiative envelope. Here, we repeat the Moravveji et al. approach&#10;but our computations include the effects of rotation also in equilibrium&#10;models. In Sect.2 we present results of our seismic modelling and&#10;conclusions ends the paper.">

<outline text="Seismic modelling" _note="\[sec-1\]&#10;&#10;Knowledge of the geometry of pulsational modes is essential in seismic&#10;modelling. In the case of KIC7760680, the quasi-equally spaced in period&#10;frequency peaks suggest that these are the modes with the same degree, ,&#10;azimuthal order, , and consecutive radial orders, . According to&#10;P[á]{}pics et al , the frequencies are associated with prograde dipole&#10;modes .&#10;&#10;In order to check whether this statement is valid if the effects of&#10;rotation are included, both in the equilibrium and pulsational&#10;calculations, we constructed a grid of rotating stellar models within&#10;the error box in and . To this end we used MESA code considering a wide&#10;range of the rotational velocity, from kms to the upper limit of the&#10;validity of the traditional approximation. As the upper limit we adopted&#10;200 kms which is about a half of the break-up velocity. The step was&#10;kms. We included various rotational mixing mechanisms, i.e., dynamical&#10;shear instability, Solberg-H[ø]{}iland instability, secular shear&#10;instability, Eddington-Sweet circulation and the&#10;Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability . We assumed the initial hydrogen&#10;abundance, , metallicity , the chemical mixture of Asplund et al. , and&#10;the overshooting parameter in exponential description, . Three commonly&#10;used opacity data were adopted: OP , OPAL and OPLIB .&#10;&#10;Then, we calculated nonadiabatic pulsation models in the framework of&#10;traditional approximation (here the step in was decreased to 0.1 kms)&#10;for modes which seemed to be good candidates to reproduce observed&#10;series of frequencies, i.e., (1,+0), (1,+1), (2,+0) and (2,+1). Since&#10;for modes other than (1,+1) the best models give worse quality of the&#10;fit, (defined as in Moravveji et al. ), by the order of magnitude, we&#10;confirm that the frequencies in the series can be associated with the&#10;prograde dipole modes.&#10;&#10;In Fig.1, the theoretical frequencies of (1,+1) modes for the best three&#10;OP models are compared with the observed ones. The parameters of these&#10;models are summarised in Table\[tab-1\]. Without a doubt, the quality of&#10;fitting needs improvement. For the best models, we obtained the values&#10;of of the order of 5500 which is the value almost three times higher&#10;than the one obtained by Moravveji et al. . This is because in our&#10;calculations we fixed metallicity and overshooting parameter compared to&#10;the cited authors. Moreover, Moravveji et al. fitted coefficient of the&#10;extra diffusive mixing in the radiatively stable envelope whereas we&#10;employed rotational induced mixing with fixed coefficients. In Fig.1 on&#10;the right Y-axis there is also shown the instability parameter ( –&#10;stable mode, – unstable mode). As one can see modes with the lowest&#10;frequencies in our best models are predicted to be stable. This is&#10;obviously contrary to the observations and needs to be improved.&#10;&#10;The quality of the fit is quantitatively the same for each considered&#10;opacity source but for models with OPLIB opacities the theoretical&#10;instability domain is in an excellent agreement with the observed&#10;frequencies. This is shown in Fig.\[fig-2\], in which three best OPLIB&#10;models are plotted. As one can see only 3–4 modes are marginally stable,&#10;. Parameters of these models as well as obtained with the OPAL opacities&#10;are summarised in Table\[tab-1\].&#10;&#10;Then, we recalculated the best OPLIB model with different values of the&#10;metallicity and overshooting parameter as well as with the modified&#10;OPLIB opacity profile. The modifications of the OPLIB data consisted of&#10;an enhancement of the opacity at the depths corresponding to&#10;temperatures , 5.46 and . The increase of the opacity at mimics the new&#10;opacity bump identified in Kurucz models by Cugier . The modified models&#10;are shown in Fig.\[fig-3\]. The increase of the opacity at by about 50%&#10;gives theoretical instability in the whole range of the observed&#10;frequencies. Moreover, for each observed frequency we found a&#10;corresponding unstable mode. Increasing opacity at helps in exciting low&#10;frequency modes whereas instability of high frequencies is unchanged. On&#10;the other hand, adding the Kurucz bump results in reducing the&#10;pulsational instability, both, at low and high frequencies. Larger value&#10;of the metallicity gives the instability domain shifted towards higher&#10;frequencies whereas more effective overshooting from the convective core&#10;acts in the opposite direction.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="Our calculations confirmed P[á]{}pics et al. finding that 36&#10;quasi-equidistant in period frequencies observed in KIC7760680 are most&#10;probably associated with the consecutive prograde dipole modes. However,&#10;our best models have slightly higher masses (from 3.340 to 3.525&#10;depending on the opacity data) compared to 3.25 obtained by Moravveji et&#10;al. . The reason is that we used rotating evolutionary models which give&#10;lower effective temperature for the same mass. Rotational induced mixing&#10;can contribute to the differences as well. We got a little worse quality&#10;of the fit, , compared to the cited authors, but in our calculations we&#10;have fixed the metallicity and the parameter of the core overshooting,&#10;which Moravveji et al. set as free. It is prominent that instability&#10;domain of the (1,+1) modes obtained with the OPLIB data (see&#10;Fig.\[fig-2\]) nearly cover the range of the observed 36 frequency&#10;peaks. A slight increase of the opacity at gives an excellent agreement.&#10;On the other hand, adding the Kurucz bump at spoils the agreement.&#10;Finally, it should be added that series of frequencies equidistant in&#10;period may be accidental as it can be reproduced by modes of various&#10;angular numbers (; see e.g. ). Therefore, it is desirable to confirm the&#10;results of mode identification using another method, e.g., using&#10;multicolour time-series photometry.">
