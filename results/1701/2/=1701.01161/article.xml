    <title>The World’s First Real-Time Testbed for Massive MIMO: Design,
Implementation, and Validation</title>
    <abstract>This paper sets up a framework for designing a massive testbed by
investigating and system-level requirements such as processing
complexity, duplexing mode and frame structure. Taking these into
account, a generic system and processing partitioning is proposed which
allows flexible scaling and processing distribution onto a multitude of
physically separated devices. Based on the given constraints such as
maximum number of links and maximum throughput for interconnections
combined with processing capabilities, the framework allows to evaluate
modular components. To verify our design approach, we present the LuMaMi
(Lund University Massive MIMO) testbed which constitutes the first
reconfigurable real-time platform for prototyping massive MIMO.
Utilizing up to 100 antennas and more than 50 , up to 12 are served on
the same time/frequency resource using an LTE-like -based transmission
scheme. Proof-of-concept tests with this system show that massive MIMO
can simultaneously serve a multitude of users in a static indoor and
static outdoor environment utilizing the same time/frequency resource. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="an unconventionally high number of antennas (hundreds or even higher) is&#10;employed to serve a factor of ten less . Due to the excess number of&#10;antennas, linear signal processing may be used to spatially focus energy&#10;with high precision, allowing to separate a multitude of in the spatial&#10;domain while using the same time/frequency resource . theory promises a&#10;variety of gains, increase in spectral and energy efficiencies as&#10;compared with single antenna and traditional MU-MIMO systems, thereby&#10;tackling the key challenges defined for 5G.&#10;&#10;Although is a promising theoretical concept, further development&#10;requires prototype systems for proof-of-concept and performance&#10;evaluation under real-world conditions to identify any further&#10;challenges in practice. Because of its importance, both industry and&#10;academia are making efforts in building testbeds, including the Argos&#10;testbed with 96-antennas, Eurecom’s 64-antenna compatible testbed,&#10;Samsung’s Full-Dimension (FD) testbed and Facebook’s Project Aries.&#10;Nevertheless, publications systematically describing the design&#10;considerations and methodology of a testbed are missing and real-time&#10;real-scenario performance evaluation of systems using testbeds have not&#10;been reported yet. At Lund University, the first real-time testbed, the&#10;testbed, showing successful transmission on the , was built. Ever since,&#10;many testbeds have been constructed based on identical utilizing the&#10;same generic design principle, the testbeds at the University of&#10;Bristol, Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim and&#10;University of Leuven in Belgium. The testbed provides a fully&#10;reconfigurable platform for testing under real-life conditions. To build&#10;a real-time testbed many challenges have to be coped with. For example,&#10;shuffling data from 100 or more antennas, processing large-scale&#10;matrices and synchronizing a huge number of physically separated&#10;devices. All this has to be managed while still ensuring an overall&#10;reconfigurability of the system allowing experimental hardware and&#10;software solutions to be tested rapidly.&#10;&#10;This paper discusses how implementation challenges are addressed by&#10;first evaluating high-level and system requirements, and then setting up&#10;a generic framework to distribute the data shuffling and processing&#10;complexity in a system based on the given constraints for&#10;interconnection network and processing capabilities. Taking into account&#10;the framework and requirements, a suitable modular platform is selected&#10;and evaluated. Thereafter, a thorough description of the testbed is&#10;provided including system parameters, base-band processing features,&#10;synchronization scheme and other details. The testbed constitutes a&#10;flexible platform that supports prototyping of up to 100-antenna&#10;bandwidth , simultaneously serving 12 in real-time using modulation in&#10;transmission mode. and constellations for real-time and uncoded&#10;transmission in a static indoor and static outdoor scenario are&#10;presented. Our first real-life proof-of-concept measurement campaigns&#10;show, that is capable of serving up to 12 in the same time/frequency&#10;resource even for high user density per unit area. The gathered results&#10;suggest a significant increase in spectral efficiency compared to&#10;traditional point-to-point systems. By building the testbed we now have&#10;a tool which supports accelerated design of algorithms and their&#10;validation based on real measurement data, with the additional benefit&#10;of real-world verification of digital base-band solutions.&#10;&#10;Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:&#10;&#10;We provide overall and thorough analysis for systems, especially from a&#10;signal processing perspective, and identify design requirements as well&#10;as considerations on building up a testbed.&#10;&#10;We propose signal processing breakdown and distribution strategy to&#10;master the tremendous computational complexity in a system and introduce&#10;general hardware architecture for a testbed.&#10;&#10;We present the world’s first real-time 100-antenna testbed, built upon&#10;technology.&#10;&#10;We validate the concept and its spatial multiplexing capability in&#10;real-life scenarios (both indoor and outdoor) with over-the-air&#10;transmission and real-time processing.">

Overall, utilizing this&#10;approach reduces the required detection matrix throughput to one matrix&#10;every 12 subcarriers, = .&#10;&#10;Two versions for detection were implemented. The first one based on a QR&#10;decomposition of the channel matrix augmented with the regularizations&#10;factors to a matrix of size . This is then formulated into a partial&#10;parallel implementation employing a systolic array. The latter one based&#10;on a Neumann-series. In the QR decomposition, each column is processed&#10;using the discrete steps of the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The&#10;logic on the co-processors can be reconfigured so that the same hardware&#10;resources that provide the decoder can also provide the and decoders,&#10;the detection / precoding schemes discussed in Sec. \[sec:MaMi\_Theory\]&#10;are supported with run-time switching. The Neumann-series based detector&#10;utilizes the unique property that in , the Gramian matrix shows dominant&#10;diagonal elements if use power control, or if scheduling is performed to&#10;serve with similar power levels in the same time/frequency block to&#10;mitigate the influence of path loss differences. This, allows the matrix&#10;inversion to be approximated with low overall error . The utilizations&#10;for the two designs are shown in Table \[tab:FPGA\_resources\].&#10;&#10;\[tab:FPGA\_resources\]&#10;&#10;Clearly, overall processing complexity and resource utilization can be&#10;significantly reduced by exploiting the special properties of .

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="This paper presented the testbed, which is the first fully operational&#10;real-time testbed for prototyping massive MIMO. Based on massive MIMO&#10;system requirements, system parameters were discussed and defined.&#10;Further, a detailed generic hardware partitioning to overcome challenges&#10;for data shuffling and link limitations while still allowing&#10;scalability, was proposed. By grouping and splitting overall bandwidth,&#10;implementation of massive MIMO signal processing was simplified to cope&#10;with challenges like precoding turnaround time and limited bandwidth&#10;enforcing strict design requirements when scaling the number of antennas&#10;up to 100 or higher. Based on the generic system partitioning and system&#10;requirements, a hardware platform was selected and evaluated. It was&#10;shown that internal system configuration is within throughput and&#10;processing capabilities before the complete testbed parameters were&#10;described. Finally, field trial results including performance&#10;measurements and constellations were presented from both indoor and&#10;outdoor measurement campaigns. The results showed that it is possible to&#10;separate up to 12 on the same time/frequency resource when using massive&#10;MIMO. Having established a flexible platform for testing new algorithms&#10;and digital base-band solutions we are able to take from theory to&#10;real-world tests and standardization for next generation wireless&#10;systems.">
