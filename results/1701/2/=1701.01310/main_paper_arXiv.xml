    <title>Direct Test of Supercooled Liquid Scaling Relations</title>
    <abstract>Diverse material classes exhibit practically identical behavior when
made viscous upon cooling toward the glass transition, suggesting a
common theoretical basis. The first-principles scaling laws that have
been proposed to describe the evolution with temperature have yet to be
appropriately tested due to the extraordinary range of time scales
involved. We used seven different measurement methods to determine the
structural relaxation kinetics of a prototype molecular glass former
over a temporal range of 13 decades and over a temperature range
spanning liquid to glassy states. For the material studied, our results
comprise a comprehensive validation of the two scaling relations that
are central to the fundamental question of whether supercooled liquid
dynamics can be described universally. The ultrabroadband mechanical
measurements demonstrated have fundamental and practical applications in
polymer science, geophysics, multifunctional materials, and other areas. </abstract>

<outline text="Experiments and Results" _note="We used seven complementary methods, based on six experimental setups,&#10;to compile ultrabroadband longitudinal compliance spectra for the&#10;glass-forming liquid tetramethyl tetraphenyl trisiloxane (sold&#10;commercially as DC704). Four of the methods were photoacoustic&#10;techniques through which acoustic waves in the frequency range  &#10;1 MHz–100 GHz were generated and detected optically. The corresponding&#10;acoustic wavelength range was  nm–2 mm. Longer acoustic wavelengths are&#10;comparable to sample sizes, so for lower frequencies in the range&#10; mHz–100 kHz, dynamical mechanical analysis methods involving&#10;piezo-ceramics that shear or compress the entire sample were used. The&#10;measurements spanned more than 13 orders of magnitude in frequency with&#10;less than three decades of gaps, yielding structural relaxation dynamics&#10;in the temperature range 200–320 K. Our earlier measurements in the low&#10;and high-frequency ranges lacked sufficient frequency coverage for&#10;comprehensive testing of the scaling predictions, but the gap was&#10;bridged by the newly developed Nanosecond Acoustic Interferometry (NAI)&#10;method. The experimental methods and data analysis through which we&#10;determined the compliance spectra and the elastic modulus (the inverse&#10;of the compliance) are described in the online Supporting Information .&#10;&#10;Figures \[fig:modcom\](a) and \[fig:modcom\](b) present the complex&#10;longitudinal modulus and compliance spectra of DC704 in the frequency&#10;range of approximately –- Hz. The imaginary parts of the spectra have&#10;gaps in the ranges of approximately –- Hz and 1–-10 GHz. In order to&#10;facilitate visualization of the temperature-dependent trends, the&#10;modulus and compliance spectra show only a subset of the data collected.&#10;&#10;The primary temperature dependence, observed clearly in both real and&#10;imaginary components of the modulus spectra, is the movement of the&#10;alpha relaxation peak across about nine decades to lower frequencies as&#10;the temperature is reduced toward the glass transition temperature  K.&#10;At any given frequency , the real part of the modulus increases as the&#10;sample is cooled, reflecting the stiffening of the liquid as it&#10;approaches the glassy state. At any given temperature , plateaus at&#10;frequencies above those of the alpha relaxation spectrum, since at such&#10;high frequencies the liquid cannot undergo structural relaxation during&#10;the acoustic oscillation period, resulting in a solid-like response.&#10;&#10;The compliance spectra show analogous behavior upon cooling: movement of&#10;the alpha relaxation spectrum across many decades and a decrease in the&#10;real part at low temperatures and high frequencies. The beta relaxation&#10;feature is observed most clearly in the imaginary parts of the modulus&#10;and compliance functions, which both rise at high frequencies.&#10;&#10;.">

<outline text="Scaling Analysis" _note="Time-temperature superposition states that for the alpha relaxation&#10;dynamics, the normalized density autocorrelation function can be written&#10;as , i.e., a single temperature independent form describes the&#10;relaxation dynamics at all temperatures, with the temperature dependence&#10;contained only in the values of the characteristic relaxation time . In&#10;that case the alpha relaxation spectrum displays analogous behavior. In&#10;order to test TTS, we normalized the imaginary compliance spectra by the&#10;peak heights and the real spectra by the high-frequency limiting value ,&#10;and shifted both by amounts that made the peak frequencies in coincide.&#10;The results are shown in Fig. \[fig:tts\]. The alpha relaxation features&#10;superpose well across the entire temperature regime studied. The&#10;imaginary parts have the characteristic asymmetric shape found for most&#10;glass-forming materials: the low-frequency sides of the alpha relaxation&#10;spectra follow the Maxwell behavior, , while the high-frequency sides&#10;follow a power-law . The shifting of the spectra to make the alpha peaks&#10;overlap separates the beta relaxation features (which all appear at the&#10;high-frequency range in Fig. \[fig:modcom\]) on the scaled frequency&#10;axis. The scaled plots highlight the increase in separation between&#10;alpha and beta relaxations upon cooling.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:mct\](a) shows the values of the characteristic relaxation&#10;time of the alpha process as a function of temperature determined from&#10;fits to the stretched exponential function with a&#10;temperature-independent stretching exponent and strongly temperature&#10;dependent values. The stretching exponent was fixed at , which at high&#10;frequencies corresponds to an decay of the imaginary part of the&#10;compliance . The observed non-Arrhenius temperature dependence is&#10;typical of glass-forming liquids and is associated generally with a&#10;complex energy landscape rather than a single activation energy for all&#10;relaxation processes . The relaxation time data were fit to the MCT&#10;power-law prediction with and as free parameters. This prediction is for&#10;temperatures above (taken as 240 K as described below), although as&#10;suggested heuristically we find that TTS applies also below 240 K. The&#10;full set of values was fitted to the commonly used empirical&#10;Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) function .&#10;&#10;The MCT interpolation formula connects the two relaxation features&#10;around the minimum between. This expression was fitted to the measured&#10;spectra in the region around the minimum. The fitted values for and are&#10;shown in Fig. \[fig:mct\](b). The uncertainty of the fits increases&#10;dramatically as the temperature increases due to the merging of the two&#10;processes making a distinction of the separate processes difficult. The&#10;MCT predicts a relation between the two exponents according to which&#10;where is the gamma-function defined as . The relation is tested in&#10;Fig. \[fig:mct\](c), which shows that the data are consistent with this&#10;prediction at temperatures above 240 K, but clearly breaks down below.&#10;We take this to define the MCT critical temperature. The value of the&#10;alpha relaxation time at , (240 K) s, is typical for , below which&#10;idealized MCT breaks down due to the onset of thermally assisted hopping&#10;through which alpha relaxation continues to occur.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:mct\](d) compares the alpha relaxation critical exponent&#10;determined in Fig. \[fig:mct\](a) based on  K to the MCT prediction that&#10;connects the power-law exponents to through the relation&#10;&#10;The above analysis indicates that MCT is valid at temperatures above&#10;240 K for the studied liquid. For the fits to be useful as a test of the&#10;MCT predictions, there must be sufficient separation between the alpha&#10;and beta relaxation spectra as from above that the and exponents can be&#10;associated distinctly with the two features. This was the case for our&#10;results below 248 K and thus MCT can be meaningfully tested in the&#10;temperature range 240–248 K.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:min\] shows the region around the minima between the alpha&#10;and beta features of the compliance loss spectra at temperatures 240 K&#10;and 248 K. As a final test Eq. (\[eq:min\]) was compared to the data&#10;with fixed exponent values. Only the minimum frequency and the minimum&#10;compliance loss positions of each curve were adjusted to fit the data.&#10;The exponent value was determined from the high-frequency wing of the&#10;alpha relaxation spectra evident in the TTS plot (Fig. \[fig:tts\]).&#10;From this the predicted value of the exponent could be calculated using&#10;Eq. (\[eq:lambda\]). This yielded the value , which should describe the&#10;low-frequency wing of the beta relaxation spectra. The resulting&#10;prediction completely determines the shape of the curves which go&#10;through the data well within the experimental scatter.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="Our measurements provide the first ultra-broadband mechanical relaxation&#10;spectra of a glass-forming liquid reaching the high frequencies of the&#10;beta relaxation spectrum and extending to the low frequencies of the&#10;alpha relaxation spectrum even as is approached. The results give direct&#10;experimental support for time-temperature superposition of the alpha&#10;relaxation spectrum above and below the MCT critical temperature&#10;(240 K), the validity of which is often assumed in empirical studies of&#10;glass-forming liquids and in modeling used for practical applications.&#10;Our results also permitted calculation of the dynamic critical exponents&#10;of MCT above , yielding results consistent with predictions that relate&#10;the alpha and beta relaxation dynamics. In continuing work, we are&#10;filling in the frequency gaps of just under three decades within the&#10;more than 13 decades that the present measurements cover. We are also&#10;extending the measurements to higher frequencies in order to improve the&#10;reliability of our tests. We also have measured shear relaxation&#10;dynamics across a wide frequency range , and filling in the frequency&#10;gaps for these measurements will permit comparison between longitudinal&#10;and shear dynamics that may show distinct temperature-dependent behavior&#10;.&#10;&#10;DC704 is the first sample for which mechanical relaxation dynamics have&#10;been measured across the frequency range we have explored. Additional&#10;glass-forming liquids must be examined in order to assess the generality&#10;of TTS and other MCT predictions. Our results demonstrate that access is&#10;now available to the extraordinarily wide frequency range needed for&#10;such comprehensive tests of supercooled liquids and a wide range of&#10;partially disordered materials including relaxor ferroelectrics, block&#10;copolymers, and many others.">

  <outline text="Overview" _note="The seven different measurement methods and the frequency ranges that&#10;they cover are summarized in Fig. \[fig:techniques\_survey\]; detailed&#10;descriptions of the techniques and data collected from them are&#10;discussed in the Supporting Information . The techniques include three&#10;low-frequency methods involving piezo-ceramics that shear or compress&#10;the entire sample quasi-statically and four higher-frequency methods&#10;utilizing short laser pulses to excite and subsequently detect acoustic&#10;waves in an irradiated region .&#10;&#10;The two lowest-frequency methods determine the complex&#10;frequency-dependent bulk modulus and shear modulus directly, where is&#10;the angular frequency. The longitudinal modulus is then given by . The&#10;four methods covering MHz-GHz frequencies determine acoustic parameters.&#10;The complex longitudinal modulus is given from the acoustic data as&#10;where is the temperature-dependent density and the complex&#10;frequency-dependent longitudinal sound velocity.&#10;&#10;In order to determine the modulus as a function of temperature from the&#10;sound velocity and damping rate, the thermal contraction of the sample&#10;must be accounted for. Using literature data of the thermal expansion&#10;coefficient and assuming this quantity is temperature independent, the&#10;following expression for the temperature dependence of the density can&#10;be derived . Once the modulus is obtained, the complex longitudinal&#10;compliance is given by .&#10;&#10;MCT relations are predictions for the mechanical susceptibility to which&#10;is proportional. Strictly speaking, is related to the density&#10;autocorrelation function and therefore to the bulk compliance, not the&#10;longitudinal compliance. However, the difference between and (and thus&#10;also the bulk and longitudinal compliances) is negligible because the&#10;shear modulus is considerably smaller than the longitudinal modulus, and&#10;their frequency-dependent dynamics are very similar at both low and high&#10;frequencies.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Sample Preparation" _note="For the PSG, PBG, and ISS measurements, DC704 was obtained from Sigma&#10;Aldrich and used without purification. For the ISS measurements, the&#10;liquid was transferred into the cell through a 0.22 m millipore filter&#10;into a fused quartz cuvette. During the ISS measurements, the sample was&#10;observed to become slightly opaque at the coldest temperatures. This is&#10;likely due to phase separation of dissolved impurities from the base&#10;liquid and disappeared when the liquid was reheated. The problem was&#10;overcome in subsequent experiments by mixing the sample with anhydrous ,&#10;combined with heating under vacuum before filtration. This approach was&#10;adopted for the NAI, TDBS, and PUI techniques. Comparison of data both&#10;with and without treatment by the drying agent showed no difference in&#10;the acoustic parameters. The DC704 samples never crystallized during the&#10;course of our experiments.&#10;&#10;The transducer techniques utilize home-built closed-cycle cryostats&#10;capable of keeping the temperature constant within a  mK , while the NAI&#10;and ISS measurements were performed in a commercially available&#10;cold-finger cryostat. In these measurements, temperature sensing was&#10;provided by a factory calibrated platinum resistors immersed in the&#10;liquid a few millimeters away from the optical beams. The TDBS and PUI&#10;techniques were performed in a commercial sample-in-vapor cryostat and&#10;the temperature was monitored at a position a few millimeters away from&#10;the sample.&#10;&#10;We did not carry out any calibration of temperatures between the&#10;cryostats of the different labs. However, the low-frequency part of the&#10;longitudinal spectrum was obtained as the sum of two individual&#10;measurements, which were carried out in the same experimental set-up&#10;(same cryostat, same electronics). We estimate that the uncertainty on&#10;the absolute temperature is less than the overall noise in the&#10;high-frequency methods.&#10;&#10;The work at MIT was supported in part by National Science Foundation&#10;Grant No. CHE-1111557 and Department of Energy Grant No.&#10;DE-FG02-00ER15087.

With this construction&#10;the gap between the discs is field free, and the liquid is subjected to&#10;a purely mechanical perturbation.&#10;&#10;The capacitance of each disc depends on its strain state, so if the&#10;liquid is partially clamping the disc (thus hindering its motion), the&#10;measured capacitance is lower than that of freely moving discs. By a&#10;precise measurement of the electrical capacitance of the PSG one can&#10;obtain the stiffness of the liquid in contact with the disc. In other&#10;words, knowing the exact relationship between the two, we can convert&#10;the electric impedance into the shear modulus.&#10;&#10;The elasto-electric compliance matrix describes the connection between&#10;the components of the stress and strain tensors and the electrical field&#10;of the piezo-electric material. The equations describing a axially&#10;polarized ceramic can be split into four independent parts, the relevant&#10;components of which can be reduced to the following where and are&#10;elastic constants of the ceramic, is the dielectric constant, and is the&#10;coupling constant.&#10;&#10;The measured capacitance of the disc can be found by integrating the&#10;charge density and dividing by the voltage where the charge density is&#10;given by Eq. (\[eomatrix\]) and is the thickness of the disc. depends&#10;both on the strain state and the applied electrical field . Evaluating&#10;this integral it is found that the capacitance is a function of the&#10;radial displacement at the edge of the disc where and are known&#10;constants. It remains to determine the displacement at the edge of the&#10;disc as a function of rigidity of the liquid. The displacement is found&#10;by solving the radial equation of motion, which reduces to where the&#10;prime indicates the derivative with respect to , is the thickness of the&#10;disc and is the tangential stress that the liquid exerts on the disc. is&#10;by definition proportional the shear modulus of the liquid , where is&#10;the thickness of the liquid layer (or equivalently the distance between&#10;the discs), which is the quantity relevant to determining the&#10;relaxation.&#10;&#10;Figure \[rawshear\] shows the measured capacitance of the empty (black&#10;trace) and liquid-filled (blue trace) PSG. At high temperatures there is&#10;no influence from the liquid at these frequencies and the two spectra&#10;are identical. The resonances in the spectrum are mechanical resonances&#10;of the discs. At lower temperatures, the shear modulus of the liquid&#10;increases and partially clamps the discs. This is observed as a drop in&#10;the capacitance below the first resonances. We will refer to the range&#10;of frequencies below the first resonance ( kHz) of the system as the&#10;QUASI-STATIC region. The liquid also influences the positions of the&#10;overtones as compared with the spectrum of the empty device. In the&#10;quasi-static region, the shear modulus is found via the described&#10;inversion procedure. The inverted data, i.e., the inferred complex shear&#10;modulus, are shown in Fig. \[sheardata\].&#10;&#10;">

    <outline text="Piezo-electric Bulk Modulus Gauge" _note="The PBG, which was also depicted in Fig. \[PGsetups\], consists of a&#10;spherical shell of a piezo-electric ceramic material polarized in the&#10;radial direction. The shell is covered by an electrode material both on&#10;the inside and the outside. Applying an electric field to the capacitor,&#10;which these electrodes constitute, deforms the ceramic (expanding or&#10;contracting depending on the direction of the field) and effectively&#10;changes the inner volume of the sphere.&#10;&#10;A liquid inside the shell will oppose this deformation and thus change&#10;the measured capacitance. The difference in capacitance between the&#10;empty, freely moving shell and the partially clamped shell can be&#10;related to the bulk modulus of the liquid. The deformation is radial. An&#10;analysis of forced vibrations in a visco-elastic sphere shows that in&#10;the low-frequency (quasi-static) region of the measurement this&#10;corresponds to an isotropic compression of the liquid, while at high&#10;frequencies it is a mixture of bulk and shear deformations.&#10;&#10;In order to be able to fill the PBG with liquid, a hole is drilled in&#10;the shell. A tube is attached over the hole. Filling this tube, as well&#10;as the entire shell, allows the PBG to draw in extra liquid when the&#10;liquid in the shell contracts during cooling. Thus the liquid volume is&#10;constant throughout the duration of the measurement, i.e., at all&#10;temperatures.&#10;&#10;The modeling of the PBG is somewhat simpler than that of the PSG since&#10;one can assume that the thickness of the ceramic is negligible in the&#10;direction of its motion. Thus we can express the model in terms of an&#10;electrical equivalent diagram, shown in Fig. \[PBG\_model\], where the&#10;conversion from electrical to mechanical energy is modeled by a&#10;transducer . On the electrical side of the diagram there is a capacitor&#10;which corresponds to the actual capacitor constituted by the two&#10;electrodes. On the mechanical side, the capacitor models the elastic&#10;properties of the ceramic, the inductor models the inertance, and the&#10;resistor models the friction. The “black box” is the liquid capacitance&#10;which is what we want to determine.&#10;&#10;The capacitance of the model depicted in Fig. \[PBG\_model\] is given by&#10;All the constants can be determined from a measurement of the empty PBG.&#10;A subsequent measurement of the liquid-filled PBG allows for the&#10;determination of the liquid’s mechanical stiffness by isolating that&#10;term.&#10;&#10;Next, we wish to express the stiffness in terms of the elastic moduli.&#10;The mechanical stiffness is . Solving the equation of motion for forced&#10;vibrations in a visco-elastic sphere one finds the displacement field ,&#10;which leads to the following expression for the stiffness of the liquid&#10;Here is the volume of the sphere, and are the (adiabatic) bulk and&#10;longitudinal moduli, and .

  <outline text="Nanosecond Acoustic Interferometry" _note="In Nanosecond Acoustic Interferometry (NAI) acoustic wavepackets with a&#10;distribution of frequency components in the low MHz range are generated&#10;by a picosecond duration pump beam loosely focused in the sample. Weak&#10;absorption leads to heating and thermal expansion of the excited region,&#10;impulsively generating an outward propagating cylindrical wave . This&#10;wave is sequentially detected at the two arms of grating interferometer&#10;due to the phase difference created by density-mediated changes in the&#10;refractive index. The interferometer arms are recombined at a&#10;diffraction grating, and we measure time-dependent changes in the&#10;intensity of the resulting single beam directed to a detector.&#10;&#10;The setup is depicted in Fig. \[fig:intersetup\]. To achieve maximum&#10;sensitivity, the incoming continuous wave probe beam passes through a&#10;polarizing beam splitting cube (PBS) and then a quarter waveplate (QWP)&#10;to induce circular polarization. After passing through the diffractive&#10;optic (binary phase mask pattern: PM), the diffraction orders are&#10;brought parallel and focused by a lens through the sample cell to a&#10;dichroic mirror at the back of the sample, which reflects the probe&#10;beams and transmits the pump. The returning beams recombine at the phase&#10;mask, pass again through the QWP, and the resulting single beam is of&#10;correct polarization for transmission through the PBS to a fast&#10;detector. A glass plate in the path of one interferometer arm was&#10;rotated for relative phase control. Signals were recorded at the&#10;relative phases and , midway between maximum constructive and&#10;destructive interference, where the induced phase change, and therefore&#10;the detected response, was greatest .&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:tdeptraces\](a) shows a recorded trace of an acoustic pulse&#10;generated in liquid DC704 passing through the first probe arm at and the&#10;second at later times. The inset shows the Fourier amplitude of the&#10;pulse at each point, where the attenuation of the wave is apparent&#10;through the relative change in spectral amplitude. In&#10;Fig. \[fig:tdeptraces\](b), we show traces recorded at a number of&#10;different sample temperatures for a set of traces normalized to the&#10;maximum amplitude.&#10;&#10;The effect of the coupling of structural relaxation to the acoustic&#10;waves is twofold. First, we observe that as temperature is decreased,&#10;the wavepacket arrives at the second probe point more quickly,&#10;corresponding to an increasing speed of sound at lower temperatures.&#10;Second, we note that the amplitude of the wavepacket has a strong&#10;temperature dependence; acoustic damping is relatively low at high&#10;temperatures in the liquid state, but as temperature is reduced, strong&#10;damping is evident due to the alpha-relaxation. As temperature is&#10;decreased further, the alpha-relaxation shifts to lower frequencies and&#10;the damping is reduced at the acoustic frequencies of our measurement&#10;where we see a solid-like response. We note that even in the absence of&#10;acoustic damping, the amplitude of the pulse at the second probe point&#10;decreases solely due to the divergent nature of the cylindrical&#10;wavepacket, which is accounted for in the analysis below.&#10;&#10;The velocity and attenuation of the excited frequency components are&#10;determined using the Fourier transform of the acoustic pulse at each&#10;detection point according to Using the shift theorem, i.e., that , and&#10;the distance between interferometer probe arms, we can recover the speed&#10;of sound for the excited frequency components via the phase. The&#10;acquired phase of the Fourier transform is , and thus by taking the&#10;derivative of the phase with respect to frequency, we recover the&#10;frequency-dependent shift in time . Using the Fourier transforms of the&#10;wavepacket at the first probe point and second probe point, we can&#10;determine the frequency-dependent sound speed via where the subscripts 1&#10;and 2 refer to the first and second probe point, respectively. In&#10;practice, the amplitude of the phase recovered from a numerical Fourier&#10;transform may depend on the number of time points in the time-domain&#10;trace, and so we needed to multiply Eq. \[eq:velo\] by a constant&#10;calibration factor. All recorded traces contained an identical number of&#10;time points, and therefore a single calibration factor for all analysis&#10;was sufficient. The calibration factor was picked to recover the sound&#10;speed of the solid phase determined at low temperatures from the PBG/PSG&#10;and ISS data; this calibration factor also recovered the liquid sound&#10;speed at high temperatures (in comparison to ISS data), and so we use it&#10;with confidence for all temperatures. All points presented here were&#10;also collected with the same probe distance , which can be determined&#10;using the grating period and the lens focal distance according to where&#10;is the lens focal length, is the probe wavelength, and is the grating&#10;period. Using our experimental parameters of a 532 nm probe wavelength,&#10;85 mm lens focal length, and m grating period, this translated to  mm&#10;distance between probe beams which agreed with a physical measurement of&#10;the distance.&#10;&#10;The frequency-dependent acoustic attenuation can be determined by the&#10;amplitude of the Fourier transform of the acoustic pulse at each probe&#10;point according to the Beer-Lambert law as Here denotes the magnitude&#10;and denotes the phase of the complex Fourier transform of the acoustic&#10;pulse at each point. As we used a round excitation spot to generate&#10;cylindrical acoustic waves with a well-defined reduction in amplitude,&#10;we account for the correction due to the acoustic wave divergence by the&#10;constant , which is given in terms of and the distance between pump spot&#10;and probe as We note that the attenuation is given here in units of&#10;inverse distance, whereas the damping rate is in units of inverse time;&#10;conversion between the two can be performed using the speed of sound.&#10;&#10;For the broadband spectral analysis we can then construct the complex&#10;acoustic modulus by which were the quantities used in our analysis&#10;below.&#10;&#10;Determination of very weak attenuation coefficients becomes unreliable&#10;for a particular frequency when the signal-to-noise ratio in the Fourier&#10;domain is too low. In practice this was observed when, for a particular&#10;frequency in the Fourier domain, the ratio of the magnitude of the&#10;difference in acoustic signal amplitudes between the first and second&#10;detection points (the amplitude at the second point being corrected by&#10;the factor A) and the magnitude of the noise at the second detection&#10;point was lower than approximately three to one. For such low&#10;attenuation rates, the imaginary part of the modulus could not be&#10;determined.">

  <outline text="Impulsive stimulated scattering" _note="In an impulsive stimulated scattering (ISS) experiment conducted in a&#10;heterodyned four-wave mixing geometry, light from a pulsed laser is&#10;incident on a diffractive optical element, typically a binary phase mask&#10;(PM) pattern, and split into two parts ( diffraction orders; other&#10;orders are blocked), which are recombined at an angle as depicted in&#10;Fig. \[fig:expt\]. The crossed excitation pulses excite an acoustic wave&#10;with wavelength given by the interference or “transient grating” period&#10;where is the excitation laser wavelength. Probe light (in the present&#10;case from a CW diode laser) is also incident on a phase mask pattern&#10;(the same one or another with the same spatial period) and split into&#10;two parts, which are recombined at the sample to serve as probe and&#10;reference beams. The signal arises from diffraction of probe light off&#10;the acoustic wave and any other spatially periodic responses induced by&#10;the excitation pulses. The diffracted signal field is superposed with&#10;the reference field for heterodyned time-resolved detection of the&#10;signal, which typically shows damped acoustic oscillations from which&#10;the acoustic frequency and damping rate can be determined.&#10;&#10;In an experiment where all four beams share common polarization V&#10;(denoted VVVV), the action of the excitation pulses is twofold. First,&#10;depending upon the absorbance at the pump wavelength, a fraction of the&#10;light is absorbed into the sample and this energy is very rapidly&#10;converted into heat. Sudden thermal expansion launches&#10;counter-propagating acoustic waves with the acoustic period . In&#10;addition to acoustic oscillations, the signal may also show slower,&#10;nonoscillatory density responses and thermal diffusion from which&#10;complex structural relaxation dynamics and thermal diffusivities may be&#10;determined . This excitation mechanism is labeled Impulsive Stimulated&#10;Thermal Scattering (ISTS) and is the dominant mechanism in the VVVV&#10;measurements.&#10;&#10;The second excitation channel arises from the electrostrictive work done&#10;on the liquid by the V-polarized excitations pulses. The electric field&#10;of the interference maxima both induces a polarization and does&#10;compressive work on the induced dipoles, resulting in impulsive&#10;excitation of counterpropagating longitudinal acoustic waves of&#10;wavelength even in the absence of optical absorption. This excitation&#10;mechanism is termed impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering (ISBS). As&#10;the force scales with the gradient of the light intensity, the&#10;efficiency of ISBS excitation scales as the acoustic wavevector .&#10;Therefore this mechanism becomes more important as the scattering&#10;wavevector is increased.&#10;&#10;The excitation pulses may also induce molecular orientational responses&#10;that can contribute to signal, analogous to depolarized quasielastic&#10;scattering , as well as contributions due to flow. In order to avoid&#10;this complication, careful selection of the probe polarization relative&#10;to the grating wavevector direction was used to eliminate these&#10;contributions to signal.&#10;&#10;The signal traces are fit to the model function  where and are ISTS&#10;amplitudes, is the amplitude for the ISBS signal, is the thermal decay&#10;time, and is the characteristic structural relaxation time stretched by&#10;the exponent n. Finally, is the observed acoustic frequency, and is the&#10;acoustic damping rate. In regimes of extremely low damping, the effect&#10;of finite pump and probe spot sizes was explicitly taken into account&#10;using the results of Yan and Nelson  via a multiplication of the&#10;acoustic damping term by a factor , where is given terms of the spot&#10;sizes of the probe beam and the excitation beam as&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:dc704lsig\] details a representative trace with m which&#10;shows excellent agreement with the model function, Eq. (\[eq:5gsol\]).&#10;These data, plotted on a logarithmic time scale to cover signal&#10;extending over 6 decades, were taken in the regime where the&#10;alpha-relaxation dynamics extend to time scales significantly longer&#10;than that of the acoustic response, resulting in insignificant acoustic&#10;damping and slow components of thermal expansion that are observed&#10;directly in the data. This slow component is represented by the&#10;stretched exponential function in the time-domain signal function of&#10;Eq. (\[eq:5gsol\]). In principle this slow signal reveals structural&#10;relaxation dynamics in the 0.1-100 s temporal range and we could equate&#10;. However, in addition to structural relaxation dynamics, this component&#10;of the signal includes heat capacity relaxation dynamics that may yield&#10;a complicated time-dependent evolution of the sample temperature at the&#10;heated interference maxima. We expect that this is a small contribution&#10;to the signal, but because we are not able to determine it through&#10;independent measurement, we did not use the slow component of our ISS&#10;data or the stretched exponential fits to them in construction of our&#10;modulus curves.&#10;&#10;For this study we focused exclusively on the acoustic contribution.&#10;Figure \[fig:longfig2\] shows three more representative traces of ISTS&#10;data recorded with 24.9 m grating spacing. In all traces there are&#10;oscillations due to counterpropagating acoustic waves. The data in (a)&#10;are taken in the high-temperature liquid state, showing weak damping of&#10;the acoustic wave. In the regime where the alpha-relaxation is on the&#10;time scale of an acoustic period, mechanical energy is quickly&#10;dissipated into structural relaxation and the acoustic signal is&#10;strongly damped, as shown in (b). Finally, when the liquid is cooled&#10;into the very viscous state as in (c), the damping rate is observed to&#10;decrease significantly. Here the effects of finite beam spot sizes lead&#10;to non-exponential decay, which is modeled by the correction term&#10;described above.&#10;&#10;The transient grating spacing (I.E., wavevector magnitude ) can be&#10;varied by changing the phase mask pattern to make the excitation pulses&#10;cross at different angles in the sample, and new data can be recorded&#10;which will reveal different acoustic frequencies and damping rates as&#10;functions of temperature. Using these acoustic parameters determined at&#10;many wavevectors at a common temperature, the complex&#10;frequency-dependent longitudinal modulus at that temperature can be&#10;determined from&#10;&#10;The excitation beams were focused to a spot 2.5 mm in the grating&#10;dimension and 100 m in the perpendicular dimension so that the acoustic&#10;waves would have many periods and the decay of signal would be due&#10;primarily to acoustic damping rather than propagation away from the&#10;excitation and probing region of the sample. In regions of extremely low&#10;damping the effects of finite spot size were taken into account, as&#10;detailed above. Damping rates as low as 2 could be measured reliably.&#10;&#10;The probe was focused to a spot of 1 mm in the grating dimension by 50 m&#10;in the perpendicular dimension. We used a common phase mask optimized&#10;for diffraction into 1 orders at 800 nm for both pump and probe beams.&#10;The local oscillator was attenuated by a factor of . Approximately of&#10;the pump power was lost into zero order with this configuration, but the&#10;pump intensity still had to be reduced significantly to avoid unwanted&#10;nonlinear effects. The signal was collected with a fast amplified&#10;photodiode with 3 GHz bandwidth and processed in a 4 GHz bandwidth&#10;digitizing oscilloscope. When slower signals were studied, we used a New&#10;Focus Model 1801-FS detector with a bandwidth of DC to 125 MHz.&#10;Depending upon signal-to-noise ratios, signals from 2,000 to 4,000&#10;repetitions of the measurement were averaged for each data trace, with&#10;total data acquisition times of less than a minute per trace.&#10;&#10;The acoustic wavelength was calibrated through ISTS measurements in&#10;ethylene glycol, for which the speed of sound is known accurately , and&#10;cross-checked with internal measurements of DC704 at high temperature&#10;where the speed of sound is constant across the range of measured&#10;acoustic wavelengths. This calibration was double-checked after all of&#10;the data collection was finished, and the variation in acoustic&#10;wavelength ranged from approximately 0.1% to 1.8%, with an average of&#10;0.7%. This determined our uncertainties in the sound speeds, but did not&#10;affect the uncertainties in the damping rate.&#10;&#10;To build acoustic spectra, data were taken by fixing the sample&#10;temperature and using every available phase mask pattern to provide&#10;wavelengths in the range from 1.75 m to 101 m. These grating spacings&#10;were 1.71 m, 1.97 m, 2.33 m, 2.68 m, 3.14 m, 3.64 m, 4.20 m, 4.85 m,&#10;5.66 m, 6.56 m, 6.70 m, 7.61 m, 9.13 m, 10.2 m, 11.7 m, 13.7 m, 15.7 m,&#10;18.3 m, 21.3 m, 24.9 m, 28.5 m, 33.0 m, 38.1 m, 44.2 m, 49.8 m, 50.7 m,&#10;56.9 m, 65.9 m, 76.0 m, 88.0 m, and 101 m. The procedure was repeated&#10;for different temperatures until the desired range was covered.">

  <outline text="Time-Domain Brillouin Scattering (3–23 GHz)" _note="In time-domain Brillouin scattering (TDBS), acoustic wave propagation at&#10;low GHz frequencies is monitored by an optical, time delayed probe at a&#10;fixed wave vector and a complex frequency is measured. The detection&#10;scheme is based on the coupling of mechanical strain with laser light&#10;through the so-called photoelastic or Brillouin effect.&#10;&#10;A schematic illustration of this technique is shown in&#10;Figure \[fig:TDBS\_sketch\]. Acoustic waves are excited by a&#10;sub-picosecond optical pump pulse which deposits energy in a&#10;photo-acoustic aluminum transducer thin film. The subsequent sudden&#10;thermal expansion launches an acoustic strain pulse into the adjacent&#10;liquid film. Probing of the propagation and attenuation of the strain&#10;pulse away from the transducer is accomplished by a second optical pulse&#10;mechanically delayed by a variable time relative to the pump. The&#10;reflected probe light consists of a number of superposing beams with a&#10;principal reflection from the transducer and minor reflections from the&#10;strain pulse . These reflections arise from the local change in&#10;refractive index produced by the presence of the strain pulse via the&#10;photoelastic or Brillouin effect. Depending on the distance of the&#10;strain pulse from the transducer film, the reflected beams interfere&#10;either constructively or destructively. This results in an oscillatory&#10;modulation of the total reflected intensity as a function of time, which&#10;can be used to determine the acoustic speed of the strain pulse in the&#10;sample while the amplitude of the modulation can be related to the&#10;amplitude of the strain.&#10;&#10;At normal incidence of the probe beam with respect to the transducer,&#10;the measured Brillouin scattering frequency is where is the index of&#10;refraction and is the optical wavelength. A measurement of this&#10;frequency can thus give the sound velocity when the refractive index of&#10;the sample is known. To determine the acoustic attenuation rate at this&#10;frequency, the raw data were fit to the time-domain form of a damped&#10;oscillator, i.e., .&#10;&#10;For the purpose of compiling broad relaxation spectra, we recorded&#10;time-domain Brillouin scattering data at many different temperatures&#10;with probe light at the laser fundamental wavelength, centered at 790&#10;nm, and frequency doubled light, centered at 395 nm. The sample was&#10;constructed from a 20 nm aluminum transducer film on a sapphire&#10;generation-side substrate and a many-micron thick liquid layer held by&#10;another sapphire substrate. This construction allowed us to monitor the&#10;propagation of the acoustic strain pulse until it was attenuated to&#10;below our detection limit.&#10;&#10;Selected raw data at several different temperatures are shown in&#10;Figure \[fig:TDBS\_rawdata\] and clearly illustrate the strong acoustic&#10;attenuation at temperatures above the glass transition temperature, K.&#10;The attenuation rate is observed to decrease as the liquid is cooled&#10;into the glassy state. Results for the extracted Brillouin scattering&#10;frequency and attenuation rate were obtained by fitting a Lorentzian&#10;oscillator as described above.">

  <outline text="Picosecond Ultrasonic Interferometry (25-120 GHz)" _note="Here we describe the manner in which a specialized picosecond laser&#10;ultrasonic technique may be combined with interferometric detection for&#10;probing longitudinal acoustic waves in the tens to hundreds of gigahertz&#10;frequency range. This method, depicted in Fig.\[fig:PUI\_sketch\], is&#10;performed in a similar sample geometry as in time-domain Brillouin&#10;scattering. Single-cycle acoustic waves are generated in a thin metal&#10;transducer film on one side of a liquid film and their arrival and shape&#10;is measured by a Sagnac interferometer  at the receiver metal film. In&#10;our analysis we compared transmitted strain pulses through different&#10;liquid thicknesses with each other in order to extract the liquid&#10;response at a fixed frequency.&#10;&#10;Our approach is to compare signals transmitted through different&#10;thicknesses of sample material. In a manner similar to the NAI&#10;experiment detailed in Sec. \[sec:NAI\], we compare the amplitudes and&#10;phases at a given frequency by Fourier transformation of the two&#10;time-domain signals and , which constitute two signals transmitted&#10;through different sample thicknesses and   (e.g., and in&#10;Fig. \[fig:PUI\_different\_strains\]).&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:PUI\_different\_strains\](a) shows a selection of the&#10;measured displacements for several different thicknesses of DC704.&#10;Typically, we measured the strain transmitted through about 50 different&#10;liquid thicknesses. A signal () from the part of the sample assembly&#10;where the transducer films were in contact is added to the plot. We did&#10;not use such signal amplitudes for our analysis since the acoustic&#10;strain in this case did not experience exactly the same conditions (due&#10;to the contact between the metal thin films) as in the other cases, but&#10;the signal provided calibration for essentially zero liquid thickness.&#10;&#10;We assume that the displacement can be described by a plane wave&#10;equation. The time-derivative of the displacement is then proportional&#10;to the strain , where is the acoustic phase velocity (assuming is&#10;non-dispersive).&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:PUI\_different\_strains\](b) shows the transmitted strain&#10;through a selection of different liquid thicknesses, labeled , , , , ,&#10;and . The shape of the strain after transmission through different&#10;liquid thicknesses is simply related to a set of acoustic parameters&#10;which includes the complex speed of sound or equivalently the complex&#10;longitudinal modulus. After traveling through an additional distance in&#10;the liquid, the Fourier domain ‘output’ strain is related to the ‘input’&#10;strain by the complex wavevector, , While the real portion of the&#10;wavevector shifts the phase of the input strain, the imaginary component&#10;of the wavevector dampens the amplitude. If we denote the transmitted&#10;strain as we can write the complex acoustic velocity as From this, the&#10;complex acoustic modulus and the acoustic compliance spectrum can be&#10;determined directly from a broadband measurement of the transmitted&#10;strain:&#10;&#10;In order to account for different attenuation strengths at different&#10;frequencies in the most reliable manner, we conducted our analysis on&#10;data sets having about 50 strain profiles, each recorded at a different&#10;liquid thickness using a fixed excitation pulse shape and at a constant&#10;sample temperature.">

We note that the measurements were typically conducted with&#10;small temperature steps (usually  K) but the measurements conducted with&#10;different methods were not all made at exactly the same temperatures. In&#10;order to show results spanning the entire frequency range at selected&#10;temperatures (e.g., 215 K, 225 K, and 235 K in Fig. 3a), we interpolated&#10;at the lower frequencies between data measured at very nearby&#10;temperatures, e.g., 214 K and 216 K for the results shown at 215 K. This&#10;procedure allowed us to reliably connect results from our highest to&#10;lowest frequency ranges despite the number of measurement methods&#10;involved.&#10;&#10;The KWW form describes only alpha relaxation, not the faster beta&#10;relaxation dynamics which clearly appear in the imaginary compliance&#10;spectra at high frequencies. In order to extend our fits to this part of&#10;the spectra, we used an alpha-beta merging model that has been described&#10;elsewhere. The fitted alpha and beta relaxation times from this model&#10;are shown in in Fig. \[fig:alphabeta\]. The alpha relaxation times show&#10;excellent agreement with the values obtained from the stretched&#10;exponential fits. The beta relaxation time is nearly constant over the&#10;range of temperatures explored here, i.e.,  ps, as expected. Although&#10;the alpha-beta model fits were not used to test MCT, they can provide&#10;insights based on their parameter values and on their implications for&#10;the connections between the real and imaginary parts of the compliance.&#10;Both the KWW and the alpha-beta fits are illustrated in&#10;Fig. \[fig:kramerskronigcheck\_dc704\] for a single temperature, 275 K.&#10;The alpha-beta model fit overshoots the real part dramatically at the&#10;highest frequencies. However, the resonance region is approached here,&#10;and we can add this to our alpha-beta model and obtain a curve that&#10;matches the rise in the imaginary part while the real part remains flat.&#10;This is shown in Fig.\[fig:kramerskronigcheck\_dc704\] in red. The fit&#10;is not perfect; the purpose here is merely to show that although beta&#10;relaxation is apparent in the imaginary spectrum only, the data do not&#10;violate the Kramers-Kronig relations. Owing to the consistency of the&#10;KWW fitting scheme with the alpha-beta analysis, as shown in&#10;Fig. \[fig:alphabeta\], the KWW fits were used in Fig. 3(b) of the main&#10;text and the subsequent analysis.">

  <outline text="Temperature dependent compliance minimum values" _note="Using the fits described in the previous section, the imaginary&#10;compliance plots may be superposed upon each other by scaling the axes&#10;by the frequency minimum and the imaginary compliance value , shown in&#10;Fig.\[mct\_pl\_pred\](a). The determined frequencies and compliance&#10;values at the minima between the alpha and beta relaxation features may&#10;be used in conjunction with the dynamic exponent to test additional MCT&#10;predictions. These predictions indicate the scaling of the imaginary&#10;susceptibility minimum as and of the minimum frequency as . In&#10;Fig. \[mct\_pl\_pred\](b) we plot both and versus temperature. The lines&#10;shown are the predictions of MCT based on the value  K. As in&#10;Figs. 5(b)–5(d) of the main paper, the parameters can be determined over&#10;a wide temperature range, but only the 240–248 K range is useful for&#10;comparison to MCT predictions. However, the uncertainties in and make&#10;this assessment difficult.&#10;&#10;[27]{}ifxundefined \[1\][ ifx[\#1]{} ]{}ifnum \[1\][ \#1firstoftwo&#10;secondoftwo ]{}ifx \[1\][ \#1firstoftwo secondoftwo ]{}““\#1””@noop&#10;\[0\][secondoftwo]{}sanitize@url \[0\][‘\&#10;12‘\$12&#10;‘&amp;12‘\#12‘12‘\_12‘%12]{}@startlink\[1\]@endlink\[0\]@bib@innerbibempty&#10;@noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} , @noop&#10;[Ph.D. thesis]{},  () , @noop [Ph.D. thesis]{},  () @noop [****,  ()]{}&#10;@noop [****,  ()]{} , @noop , , () @noop [****,  ()]{} , @noop [Ph.D.&#10;thesis]{},  () @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****, &#10;()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [ ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop&#10;[****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [Ph.D. thesis]{},  () @noop&#10;[****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****, &#10;()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop [****,  ()]{} @noop&#10;[****,  ()]{}">
