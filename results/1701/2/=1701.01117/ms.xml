    <title>A Massive Shell of Supernova-formed dust in SNR G54.1+0.3</title>
    <abstract>While theoretical dust condensation models predict that most refractory
elements produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) efficiently condense
into dust, a large quantity of dust has so far only been observed in
SN 1987A. We present the analysis of [SPITZER ]{}SPACE TELESCOPE,
[HERSCHEL ]{}SPACE OBSERVATORY, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA), and AKARI observations of the infrared (IR) shell
surrounding the pulsar wind nebula in the supernova remnant G54.1+0.3.
We attribute a distinctive spectral feature at 21  to a magnesium
silicate grain species that has been invoked in modeling the
ejecta-condensed dust in Cas A, which exhibits the same spectral
signature. If this species is responsible for producing the observed
spectral feature and accounts for a significant fraction of the observed
IR continuum, we find that it would be the dominant constituent of the
dust in G54.1+0.3, with possible secondary contributions from other
compositions, such as carbon, silicate, or alumina grains. The smallest
mass of SN-formed dust required by our models is 1.1  0.8 . We discuss
how these results may be affected by varying dust grain properties and
self-consistent grain heating models. The spatial distribution of the
dust mass and temperature in G54.1+0.3 confirms the scenario in which
the SN-formed dust has not yet been processed by the SN reverse shock
and is being heated by stars belonging to a cluster in which the SN
progenitor exploded. The dust mass and composition suggest a progenitor
mass of 16–27  and imply a high dust condensation efficiency, similar to
that found for Cas A and SN 1987A. The study provides another example of
significant dust formation in a Type IIP SN and sheds light on the
properties of pristine SN-condensed dust. </abstract>

<outline text="INTRODUCTION" _note="Interstellar dust plays a significant role in virtually all processes&#10;governing the evolution of galaxies and is a key ingredient in chemical&#10;evolution models and feedback processes important for star formation.&#10;Dust can be produced in the stellar wind outflows of massive stars and&#10;in the ejecta of core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions. However, the&#10;quantity and relative fraction of dust formed in these sources are still&#10;not well understood. The question of whether SN explosions are primary&#10;sources of dust in the Universe is still under debate. High dust masses&#10;observed in high-redshift galaxies suggest that large quantities of dust&#10;had to form on timescales of only a few hundred million years , pointing&#10;to core-collapse SNe as the most likely sources. Dwek, Galliano &amp; Jones&#10;(2009) find that an average SN explosion would need to produce anywhere&#10;from 0.1 to 1.0 of dust in order to explain the observed dust mass of in&#10;the galaxy SDSS J1148+5251 at a redshift of 6.4. The range of required&#10;masses is strongly dependent on the efficiency of dust destruction in&#10;the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Theoretical dust formation models using classical nucleation theory and&#10;the chemical kinematic approach for the formation of molecular&#10;precursors do indeed predict that 0.03-0.7 of dust can form in the&#10;ejecta of core-collapse SNe, and that the grain properties and masses&#10;depend on factors such as the type of SN explosion, the mass of the SN&#10;progenitor, metallicity, and clumping and mixing of the SN ejecta .&#10;However, observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) and extragalactic SNe&#10;in the mid-infrared (IR) have generally revealed dust masses that are&#10;orders of magnitude lower, in the range of (see Gall et al. 2011 for a&#10;review). While it was hypothesized that a large mass of SN dust may be&#10;cooler and emitting primarily at far-IR wavelengths, the lack of&#10;sensitivity and spatial resolution, in addition to high confusion noise,&#10;prohibited clear detections of SN-formed dust in many SNe and SNRs.&#10;&#10;Far-IR [HERSCHEL ]{}observations provided evidence for a significant&#10;amount of dust in only three SNRs; the Crab Nebula, Cas A, and SN 1987A.&#10;The dust mass in the Crab Nebula is estimated to be between 0.02-0.3 ,&#10;while the current mass in Cas A is   , with 0.8-1.0 predicted to have&#10;formed initially, before being sputtered away by the SN reverse shock .&#10;&#10;[HERSCHEL ]{}observations of SN 1987A led to an exciting discovery of a&#10;significant mass of dust that likely formed in the SN ejecta . The&#10;ejecta origin was later confirmed with Atacama Large&#10;Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations . The latest estimate&#10;indicates that at least 0.5 of dust formed in the explosion. However,&#10;the composition of the dust is still a matter of debate , and how much&#10;will eventually survive the passage of the SN reverse shock is still&#10;unknown.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we present a follow-up study of the dusty shell in the&#10;SNR G54.1+0.3, indicating that this system contains a significant mass&#10;of SN-formed dust. G54.1+0.3 contains a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with a&#10;well-defined jet and torus structure, exhibiting properties similar to&#10;the Crab Nebula . The age of the system is estimated to be 1500–3000 yrs&#10;. Based on the spectral types of stars in the surrounding stellar&#10;cluster, constrain the range of the progenitor mass to be 18–35 that&#10;likely resulted in a Type IIP SN explosion. This range overlaps with the&#10;results of who derived a progenitor mass of 15–20 using a model for the&#10;dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN inside an SNR.&#10;&#10;The [SPITZER ]{}mid-IR images of this system revealed a shell of&#10;emission surrounding the PWN and a dozen point sources embedded in the&#10;shell with an apparent 24  IR excess. Due to this excess, the point&#10;sources were originally attributed to young stellar objects (YSOs) whose&#10;formation was triggered by the progenitor star . However, the analysis&#10;of line emission detected with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) aboard&#10;[SPITZER ]{} revealed that the shell has a high expansion velocity of up&#10;to 500 and that the emission likely originates from SN ejecta. The IR&#10;excess in the point sources can be attributed to SN-formed dust that is&#10;heated to higher temperatures as it blows past early-type stars that are&#10;members of the cluster in which the SN exploded . used near-IR&#10;spectroscopic observations of the stellar sources to determine their&#10;spectral types and concluded that they are indeed late O- or early&#10;B-type stars that show no evidence for emission lines often present in&#10;Herbig Ae/Be stars. also also constrained the distance to G54.1+0.3 by&#10;calculating the photometric distances to the stars in the shell based on&#10;their spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitted temperatures. Their&#10;derived distance range is 4.6–8.1 kpc, with an average of 6.0  0.4 kpc.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we analyze the mid- and far-IR emission from the shell&#10;surrounding the PWN in G54.1+0.3 using the [SPITZER ]{}SPACE TELESCOPE,&#10;[HERSCHEL ]{}SPACE OBSERVATORY, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared&#10;Astronomy (SOFIA), and AKARI observations in order to confirm the origin&#10;and determine the properties of the dust in the IR shell.">

The PACS observations were performed on&#10;2011 Nov 5 using the “scan map” mode and a scan speed of 20 arcsec&#10;(proposal ID: OT1\_TTEMIM\_1, observations IDs: 1342231919-1342231922).&#10;The SPIRE observations were performed on 2011 May 2 and 2011 Oct 23 in&#10;the “parallel mode&quot;, under the proposal ID KPOT\_SMOLINAR\_1&#10;(observation IDs: 1342219812, 1342219813, 1342231341, and 1342231342).&#10;The imaging observations were processed and reduced with the HERSCHEL&#10;Interactive Processing Environment version 14.0.0 and images produced&#10;using the MADMAP software . The resulting PACS and SPIRE images are in&#10;units of Jy/pixel with pixel scales (full width at half-maxima, FWHM) of&#10;1.6, 1.6, 3.2, 6, 10, and 14/pixel (6, 8, 12, 18.1, 24.9, and 36.4) for&#10;the 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500  images, respectively.

  <outline text="SOFIA Imaging" _note="G54.1+0.3 was observed by SOFIA on 2016 Feb 18 (OC4-A Flight 8), using&#10;the Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST).&#10;Simultaneous imaging in the short and long wavelength channels, using a&#10;cold dichroic beamsplitter, was done in F197 (+F315) and F253 (+F348)&#10;broadband filters with effective wavelengths of 19.7 (31.5), and 25.3&#10;(34.8) m and bandwidths of 5.5 (1.86), 5.7 (3.8) m, respectively.&#10;G54.1+0.3 is an extended (5 in size) IR source that fits nicely into the&#10;FORCAST field-of-view. Chopping and nodding were done symmetrically&#10;about the telescope’s optical axis, using symmetric nod-match-chop (NMC)&#10;with a chop throw (the nod throw is matched to the chop throw in this&#10;chopping and nodding mode). This fairly large chop throw degrades the&#10;image quality by asymmetric smearing of the PSF at a level of per of&#10;chop amplitude. The resulting image degradation at the long wavelengths&#10;(31.5 m and 34.8 m) is quite modest, but at short wavelengths it becomes&#10;noticeable for unresolved point sources. No image dithering was&#10;employed. After postprocessing, the image pixel is . Data reduction was&#10;done at the SOFIA Science Center . We use the processed, flux calibrated&#10;(Level 3) images obtained from the raw (Level 1) observations of&#10;G54.1+0.3 using the standard FORCAST processing pipeline. The total&#10;exposure times are 1625, 1750, 1875, and 1670 s in F197, F253, F315, and&#10;F348 filters, respectively. The calibration uncertainty for each band is&#10;assumed to be  20% . The measured flux of the 25.3  image in particular&#10;is significantly lower than the measured MIPS 24  flux. We suspect that&#10;this observation was not sensitive to the fainter extended emission due&#10;to the poor throughput of the FORCAST 25.3  filter. The lack of faint&#10;extended emission is also evident in the FORCAST 25.3  image shown in&#10;Figure \[imgpanel\]. Due to the unreliable flux estimate for the&#10;extended emission, we exclude the 25.3  SOFIA data point from our&#10;analysis and fitting of the IR SED.">

<outline text="General Morphology" _note="The individual IR images of G54.1+0.3 from 15–500  are shown in&#10;Figure \[imgpanel\], while the morphological comparison of X-ray, radio,&#10;and IR wavelengths is shown in the color images of Figure \[3color\].&#10;The left panel of Figure \[3color\] shows the three-color image, with&#10;the [CHANDRA ]{}X-ray emission in blue, and [SPITZER ]{}8 and 24&#10; emission in green and red. The X-ray image clearly shows the location&#10;of the pulsar (white point source), surrounded by a PWN with a well&#10;defined torus structure . There is a jet extending from the pulsar&#10;directly towards the west. The 8  emission in green primarily shows&#10;emission from stellar sources. The 24  image shows that the PWN is&#10;surrounded by a shell of IR emission, approximately 13 in radius. The&#10;dozen point sources that appear yellow in the image also have strong 24&#10; fluxes. This is more clearly seen in the individual 24  image in&#10;Figure \[imgpanel\]. The sources appear to be embedded in the diffuse IR&#10;emission and arranged in a ring-like structure.&#10;&#10;The middle panel of Figure \[3color\] shows the PWN’s 4.8 GHz radio&#10;emission from the Very Large Array (VLA) in red , and [HERSCHEL ]{}PACS&#10;100  emission in cyan. The location of the pulsar is marked by the white&#10;plus symbol. The PWN has a similar spatial extent at radio and X-ray&#10;wavelengths. The radio nebula fills the cavity of the shell that is&#10;traced by the 100  emission and appears to have expanded into this&#10;material. The complementary morphology of the radio and IR emission&#10;confirms the association and possible interaction between the PWN and&#10;the IR shell.&#10;&#10;The 15 and 24  images show point-like emission that coincides with the&#10;stellar sources observed at 8  (see Figure \[imgpanel\]). In the higher&#10;resolution SOFIA images, these sources appear to be somewhat more&#10;extended. While the 31.5–100  images do show some structure and regions&#10;of enhanced emission, there is no clear evidence for point-like&#10;emission. At 160  and above, the shell emission appears more uniform,&#10;partly due to the lower resolution at these wavelengths. While a full&#10;shell is still apparent in the 160 and 250  images, the emission at 350&#10;and 500  primarily arises from a more localized region in the western&#10;part of the shell. This may suggest that there is either a higher&#10;fraction of colder dust present in this region of the shell, leading to&#10;a higher flux density at 500 , or that there is more mass, and therefore&#10;higher emission, concentrated in the western region. The shell&#10;morphology in the mid- and far-IR appears to be different. The emission&#10;at 70 and even at 100  appears more circular, while the shell structure&#10;at 250  appears more elongated in the north/south direction. This is&#10;most apparent in the two-color image shown in the third panel&#10;Figure \[3color\], in which the 70  image shown in teal has been&#10;convolved to the resolution of the 250  image shown in red. The 160&#10; emission in Figure \[imgpanel\] seems to be a blend of these two&#10;morphologies. In later sections, we will show that the emission in the&#10;far-IR either arises from distinct dust component than the one producing&#10;the mid-IR emission, or that it is associated with background emission.">

<outline text="Origin of the IR Shell" _note="The study of the [SPITZER ]{}IR imaging and spectroscopy of the shell in&#10;G54.1+0.3 concluded that the emission most likely arises from newly&#10;formed dust in the SN ejecta . In this scenario, the IR emitting&#10;material is the inner SN ejecta that the PWN is expanding into and that&#10;has not yet been reached by the SNR reverse shock. In addition to the&#10;complementary morphologies of the PWN and the shell that suggest that&#10;they are interacting, modeling of the observed IR line intensities from&#10;the shell implies that the PWN is driving a 25-30 shock into the ejecta.&#10;In one particular location (coinciding with Region 2 in&#10;Figure \[3color\]), the measured gas density is as high as 500–1300 .&#10;This region coincides with a brightness peak in the MIPS 24  image and&#10;may represent ejecta material that has been compressed by the shock&#10;driven by the pulsar’s jet . Another piece of evidence that suggests&#10;that the shell material is composed of SN ejecta is the composition of&#10;the dust itself (see Section \[comp\]).&#10;&#10; argued that the IR excess in the point sources in the [SPITZER ]{}24&#10; image (see Figures \[3color\] and \[imgpanel\]) is not stellar in&#10;origin, but that the emission instead arises from ejecta dust that is&#10;being radiatively heated by early-type stars belonging to a stellar&#10;cluster in which the SN exploded. The stars heat the dust in their&#10;immediate vicinity to higher temperatures, giving rise to a mid-IR&#10;excess that appears point-like due to the limited spatial resolution.&#10;This scenario is consistent with the morphology of the images in&#10;Figure \[imgpanel\], in which we see that the regions with enhanced&#10;brightness in the long wavelength SOFIA and the MIPS 70  images and&#10;longward do not appear point-like, but are instead more extended.&#10;classified the spectral type of each star in the shell and concluded&#10;that they are indeed late O- and early B-type stars with no evidence for&#10;any emission lines that are typically associated with Herbig Ae/Be&#10;stars. This provides further evidence that the 24  point-like emission&#10;is not intrinsic to the stars.&#10;&#10;The evidence outlined above strongly suggests that the IR shell is not&#10;circumstellar in origin and that the mid-IR point sources are not YSOs.&#10;An additional argument against a circumstellar origin is the lack of any&#10;X-ray thermal emission that would results from the interaction of the SN&#10;blast wave with the surrounding dense material. Additionally, a reverse&#10;shock would have formed as the SN blast wave encountered the cloud and&#10;significantly disrupted the PWN. However, the well-defined torus and jet&#10;structures and the modeling of the PWN evolution strongly suggest that&#10;this has not occurred and that the material that we observe in the shell&#10;arises from inner SN ejecta.&#10;&#10;The G54.1+0.3 system is analogous to the Crab Nebula, which also&#10;consists of a PWN expanding into and radiatively heating SN ejecta and&#10;dust . However, in the case of G54.1+0.3, the stars that are part of the&#10;cluster in which the progenitor was born serve as the primary heating&#10;sources for the SN-condensed dust as it blows past them. We note that&#10;additional ejecta material may be present beyond the radius of the&#10;observed IR shell, but remain undetected due to its cold temperature.">

  <outline text="Extraction of Source Fluxes" _note="The source fluxes for the entire IR shell in G54.1+0.3 were measured&#10;from the AKARI, SOFIA, [SPITZER ]{}MIPS 24 , and [HERSCHEL ]{}PACS and&#10;SPIRE images that are shown in Figure \[imgpanel\]. The SOFIA FORCAST&#10;fluxes were extracted from the images using a circular aperture with a&#10;radius of 10, centered on the IR shell. Since the observations were&#10;performed using the chop/nod technique, the background was already&#10;removed from the images. The AKARI, [SPITZER ]{}and [HERSCHEL ]{}fluxes&#10;were extracted using an aperture around the IR shell, approximately a&#10;circle with a 15 radius, and a 41 45 rectangular region for the&#10;background, centered on the shell and excluding the source extraction&#10;region. We used the average value in the rectangular region as the&#10;background flux and the standard deviation of the pixel-to-pixel fluxes&#10;within the region as the background uncertainty. Significant spatial&#10;variations in the brightness of the background are evident in the&#10;160-500  images shown in Figure \[imgpanel\]. In calculating the average&#10;background in the SPIRE 250-500  images, we masked the brightest cores&#10;of the surrounding clouds. The overall uncertainties in the measured&#10;flux densities longward of 100  are dominated by background confusion.&#10;The foreground/background stellar sources that appear in the 15  AKARI&#10;image, but not at 24 , were excluded from the flux measurement.&#10;&#10;The IR flux densities for the G54.1+0.3 shell are listed in&#10;Table \[tab1\]. We applied an extinction correction to the&#10;15.0–34.8  flux densities using the mid-IR interstellar extinction law&#10;derived by from the SDSS- III/APOGEE spectroscopic survey. For the bands&#10;that were not explicitly calculated in , we used the average of the and&#10;the =5.5 extinction curves . These two curves diverge only for our 15&#10;and 19  data points. In deriving the corrections, we assume =7.3 ,&#10;leading to =0.82. The final extinction correction factors that were used&#10;in the SED fitting are listed in Table \[tab1\].">

  <outline text="Fitting of the IRS Spectra" _note="In Figure \[irsspec\], we show the line-subtracted continuum emission at&#10;the two IRS positions shown in Figure \[3color\]. The prominent emission&#10;feature at 21  has been attributed to dust grains and used by to fit the&#10;dust continuum in Cas A. The mass absorption coefficient that clearly&#10;shows this feature is plotted as the purple curve in Figure \[kappas\].&#10;The spectra in Figure \[irsspec\] show that the feature is much more&#10;prominent in position 2 than position 1. We find that the IRS spectra&#10;are well fitted by a hotter dust component of either carbon or silicate&#10;grains, plus a dust composition emitting at cooler temperature. The hot&#10;component has a best-fit temperature of 147 2 K (152 1 K) for carbon&#10;grains and 146 1 (133 1) for silicate grains at positions 1 (2). The&#10;best-fit temperatures of the dust are 47 1 and 58 1 at positions 1 and&#10;2, respectively, independent of whether the carbon or silicate grains&#10;are used to model the hot dust component. The fits indicate that the hot&#10;dust component dominates the spectra shortward of 17 , while the warm&#10;component dominates at longer wavelengths. The difference in the shapes&#10;of the mid-IR continua at the two positions appear to be caused by&#10;variations in the dust temperature of the warm component and not by&#10;variations in the grain composition, with the less prominent 21  feature&#10;at position 1 being an effect of a colder dust temperature that peaks at&#10;longer wavelengths.">

  <outline text="Global SED Fits" _note="The global SED of the IR shell is shown in Figures \[dustfits\] and&#10;\[dustfits2\], with individual flux density values listed in&#10;Table \[tab1\]. show that the 21  spectral feature is present in all&#10;regions covered by the [SPITZER ]{}low-resolution IRS slits, and since&#10;the slits span the entire length of the IR shell in the east/west&#10;direction, this suggests that the feature is likely present throughout&#10;the shell. We also verified that the hot dust component arising from the&#10;fits to the IRS high-resolution spectra in Figure \[irsspec\] is also&#10;present in all regions covered by the low-resolution slits. We therefore&#10;included the hot dust component from either carbon grains&#10;(Figure \[dustfits\]) or silicate grains (Figure \[dustfits2\]), as well&#10;as a contribution from grains in all of our SED fits. While an&#10;additional third component was not statistically significant in the fit,&#10;we explored the possibility of its presence using various grain&#10;composition.&#10;&#10;As part of our fitting method, we convolved the model spectra with the&#10;spectral response of each instrument to derive the expected flux density&#10;in each bandpass, applied extinction to each of the values by dividing&#10;by the extinction factors in Table \[tab1\], and then fitted the&#10;resulting values to the observed flux densities. Figures \[dustfits\]&#10;and \[dustfits2\] show the observed flux densities and their&#10;uncertainties in red, the best-fit model spectra as the black curves,&#10;and the bandpass-integrated and reddened model flux densities in black,&#10;with the filter widths indicated by the horizontal black lines.&#10;&#10;We first fitted the global SED with two dust components; a hot dust&#10;component of either carbon or silicate grains, and a cooler component of&#10;grains. We fixed the hot component’s temperatures to those found in the&#10;spectral fits in Figure \[irsspec\], 150 K for carbon and 140 K for&#10;silicates, while letting their normalizations vary. The resulting&#10;best-fit normalization leads to a dust mass of (4.6 1.2) and (2.2 0.5)&#10;for carbon and silicate grains, respectively. The resulting relative&#10;normalizations of the hot and warm components are consistent with those&#10;found for the spectral fits.&#10;&#10;We then performed fits to the global SED using an additional (third)&#10;cold component composed of various grain compositions. In addition to&#10;trying an additional cold component of grains (Figure \[dustfits\]b), we&#10;also tested amorphous carbon , silicates , , and grains. The mass&#10;absorption coefficients for these grain species are shown in&#10;Figure \[kappas\], while the best fits to the SED are shown in&#10;Figure \[dustfits\]c–\[dustfits\]f with carbon as the hot component, and&#10;Figure \[dustfits2\]c–\[dustfits2\]f with silicates as the hot&#10;component. The best-fit dust temperatures and masses for all models in&#10;Figures \[dustfits\] and \[dustfits2\] are listed in Table \[tab2\] and&#10;will be discussed in detail in Sections \[temp\] and \[mass\].&#10;&#10;The hot carbon/silicate plus a single warm model gives a best-fit&#10;temperature of 47 K and a mass of 1.8 0.3 , assuming a distance of 6.0&#10;kpc. The implausibly large dust mass suggests that the grains are not&#10;the sole contributors to the mid-IR SED and that other grain&#10;compositions are likely also present. The addition of another&#10;composition resulted in a lower for all models, with carbon grains&#10;providing a somewhat higher than the others due to its flatter slope in&#10;emissivity at longer wavelengths (see Figure \[kappas\]). The best-fit&#10;temperature of the primary dust component is 47–49 K for all model&#10;combinations. The temperature and mass of the secondary dust composition&#10;are not well constrained and this produces very large uncertainties in&#10;the relative masses of the different grain compositions as well as in&#10;the total dust mass in the shell.&#10;&#10;The relative flux densities of the best fit models plotted in&#10;Figures \[dustfits\] and \[dustfits2\] appear to be consistent with the&#10;observed morphologies in Figure \[imgpanel\]. For instance, as mentioned&#10;in Section \[morph\], the morphology at 100  and below is different than&#10;the observed structure at 250 . The best fits to the global SED show&#10;that the emission up to 100  is dominated by the warm dust component,&#10;while the colder dust component that may have a different spatial&#10;morphology dominates at 250  and above. In the 160  band, the warm and&#10;cold component have comparable contributions. In later sections, we will&#10;explore the possibility that the emission at 250  and above actually&#10;arises from a background cloud.">

  <outline text="Spatially Resolved Fits: Dust Mass &amp;amp; Temperature Maps" _note="In order to explore the spatial variations in the dust temperature and&#10;mass of the shell, we fitted the SEDs of individual pixels across the&#10;shell using a single dust component of grains. In order to preserve the&#10;spatial resolution, minimize the effects of the background confusion,&#10;and also to only model wavelengths that appear to have similar&#10;morphologies, we only used the 15–100  images in our fits. The SOFIA&#10;images were also excluded due to the poor sensitivity to the fainter&#10;emission in the shell. The images were all convolved to the PACS 160&#10; resolution using the convolution kernels, resulting in a pixel size of&#10;32. The SED fits provided a temperature and corresponding dust mass for&#10;each pixel. These maps are shown in Figure \[dustmaps\], with the left&#10;panel showing the temperature map and the right panel showing the dust&#10;mass surface density map. The black contours represent the [CHANDRA&#10;]{}X-ray emission from the PWN seen in Figure \[3color\], while the “x&quot;&#10;symbols represent the locations of the stars identified by and .&#10;&#10;The temperature in the shell varies from 42 – 57 K with an average&#10;temperature and standard deviation of 46 4 K. The sum of the individual&#10;pixels in the dust mass surface density map leads to a total dust mass&#10;of , consistent with the mass derived from fitting the integrated SED of&#10;the shell using only grains (see Table \[tab2\]). The dust mass and&#10;temperature maps are consistent with the physical scenario proposed by&#10;in which the stellar sources heat the surrounding SN-condensed dust,&#10;since the temperature clearly peaks at the locations of the stellar&#10;sources, while the dust mass surface density shows no such correlation.&#10;The dust mass surface density map does show a slight deficiency in dust&#10;mass at the locations of the brightest stellar sources. The most likely&#10;explanation for this deficiency is that the temperature at the locations&#10;of the stars was slightly overestimated due to the inclusion of 15  data&#10;that has a significant contribution from hot dust.&#10;&#10;In order to determine how well the single-component spatial fits match&#10;the global SED, we compared the observed and model-predicted flux&#10;densities of the shell at all observed wavebands. While the 19-70  data&#10;are well represented by the model, the 15  flux is underestimated by&#10;35%. The model also underestimates the observed emission at 100, 160,&#10;250, 350, and 500 , by 28%, 44%, 43%, 23%, and 16%, respectively. In&#10;order to investigate the nature of the excess emission above the&#10;best-fit spatial model, we used the dust mass and temperature maps in&#10;Figure \[dustmaps\] to produce model-predicted flux density images at&#10;15, 24, 70, 100, and 160 , and then divided the observed images by these&#10;maps to produce ratio maps. The ratio maps are shown in&#10;Figure \[ratios\], all using the same linear scale (0.8–3.3) and color&#10;scheme. The blue color indicates a ratio of 1, where the model most&#10;closely matches the observation, while the values above unity show the&#10;spatial distribution of the emission excess that was not well-predicted&#10;by the model. The 24 and 70  emission is clearly well-described by the&#10;model across the entire shell, while there is a clear excess at 15, 100,&#10;and 160 .&#10;&#10;The spatial distribution of the excess at 15  is particularly&#10;interesting. It does not at all correlate with the shell morphology at&#10;24 , but is instead concentrated along a thin shell on the outskirts of&#10;the observed mid-IR shell, as well as a couple of point sources, one of&#10;which is a background source not associated with the SNR. This suggests&#10;that the 15  excess emission does not belong to the same dust component&#10;that emits at 24 , but instead may be produced by hot dust grains that&#10;have a different spatial distribution or by line emission that could&#10;partly contribute to the 15  AKARI band. One hypothesis is that very&#10;small dust grains in the shell are heated to temperatures much higher&#10;than the equilibrium temperature due to their lower heat capacity, and&#10;that their emission is more pronounced at the outskirts of the cluster&#10;where the radiation field starts to drop off and where the temperature&#10;of the larger grains is cooler. The presence of this hot component is&#10;also supported by the fits to the IRS spectra shown in&#10;Figure \[irsspec\]. We note here that the average contribution of the&#10;hot dust component in the IRS fits to the 15  AKARI waveband is 35%, the&#10;same fraction that is seen in the 15  excess above the best spatial fit&#10;(first panel of Figure \[ratios\]).&#10;&#10;The ratio maps at 100 and 160  show that the morphology of the excess&#10;emission resembles the morphology in the far-IR. This is seen more&#10;clearly in Figure \[160\], where we show the observed 160  image in&#10;panel (a), the spatial model-predicted 160  flux arising from in panel&#10;(b), the residual between the observed image and the fitted model in&#10;panel (c), and the 250  observed image in panel (d). For comparison, we&#10;also show a map of the \[\] 157.7  line emission from the PACS spectral&#10;observations in Figure \[160\]e, which does not seem to correlate with&#10;the 160  dust emission, but instead shows a spatial distribution more&#10;similar to the morphology of the 15  excess in Figure \[ratios\]. The&#10;residual map in panel (c) of Figure \[160\] clearly shows that the&#10;excess emission at 160  closely resembles the morphology at 250 ,&#10;suggesting that the 100 and 160  excess above the spatial model either&#10;arises from a distinct dust component that dominates the emission at&#10;longer wavelengths or from background emission not associated with the&#10;SNR.&#10;&#10;In Section \[globalfit\], we explored the possibility that an additional&#10;dust component with a different composition contributes to the global&#10;SED of the shell and dominates the emission at wavelengths longer than&#10;100 . The best-fit parameters for the models that include this secondary&#10;component are listed in Table \[tab2\]. Another possibility is that the&#10;emission at long wavelengths actually originates from a background&#10;cloud, since the morphology at wavelengths longer than 160   differs&#10;from the morphology at shorter wavelengths. If we assume that the&#10;emission at 24-70  is dominated by a single dust component of , as was&#10;assumed in the spatial fit, we can then test whether the level of&#10;residual emission at longer wavelengths is consistent with the&#10;surrounding background. In Figure \[colorplot\], we show a scatter plot&#10;of the 100 versus 160  flux densities for the observed emission in the&#10;shell, the best-fit spatial model for a single component of grains, the&#10;residual emission after the subtraction of the spatial model, and&#10;finally, the background emission in an annulus surrounding the source.&#10;The gray lines represent the 160/100  ratios for various temperature of&#10;grains. As can be seen from the plot, the best-fit spatial model is&#10;composed of grains emitting in a narrow temperature range between 45 and&#10;55 K (also seen in the left panel of Figure \[dustmaps\]), while the&#10;long-wavelength residual is seen to have the same properties as&#10;surrounding background emission.&#10;&#10;In this scenario, the grains with a temperature and mass distribution&#10;shown in Figure \[dustmaps\] dominate the emission from 15–100 , while&#10;residual background emission significantly contributes to the 160  flux&#10;and dominates at the far-IR SPIRE wavelengths. We therefore performed&#10;additional fits to the global SED, assuming that the residual&#10;long-wavelength emission arises from the background. We used the same&#10;compositions as in Section \[globalfit\], but subtracted the residual&#10;long-wevelength emission from the integrated flux densities. Since the&#10;fit, by definition, is well described by a single component of warm&#10;grains (in addition to the hot component derived from the spectral&#10;fits), a third component is not statistically significant. However,&#10;adding this component allowed us to test whether an addition of grains&#10;of a different composition affects the best-fit dust parameters. The&#10;results of the fits are included in Table \[tab2\], in the subsections&#10;indicating that the long-wavelength residual emission has been excluded,&#10;and will be discussed in Sections \[temp\] and \[mass\].">

  <outline text="Composition" _note="The prominent spectral feature that is observed at 21  has the same&#10;spectral profile as the feature observed in the spectrum of the&#10;SN-condensed dust in Cas A . As far as we know, Cas A and G54.1+0.3 are&#10;the only two sources whose spectra exhibit a feature of this particular&#10;shape. attributed the feature to grains, characterized by an MgO to SiO&#10;ratio of 0.7. Out of sixty different grain compositions that they&#10;tested, this species is the only one that has a 21  spectral feature&#10;that fits the width and shape of the feature observed in Cas A. As&#10;discussed in Section \[specfit\], we confirmed that the same grain&#10;species can fit the [SPITZER ]{}high-resolution spectra of G54.1+0.3&#10;that are shown in Figure \[irsspec\]. Since the 21  feature is present&#10;throughout the low-resolution IRS slits that run across the IR shell ,&#10;we used the grains as the primary component in all our fits, but also&#10;included other common grain compositions predicted by dust condensation&#10;models in Type IIP SNe for possible secondary components. For example,&#10;the models of and predict that 80–100% of the SN-condensed dust in&#10;Type IIP explosions of  20  progenitors is made up of carbon, alumina,&#10;and some form of magnesium silicate grains. The mass absorption&#10;coefficients of the grain species used in our fits are shown in&#10;Figure \[kappas\], and they include amorphous carbon, silicates, , and .&#10;Another common dust composition predicted by is MgO, but our fits&#10;disqualify a major contribution from this species due its spectral&#10;feature at  100  that does not appear in the SED of the shell.&#10;&#10;The best fits in Figure \[dustfits\] and Table \[tab2\] indicate that if&#10;the grains are indeed responsible for producing the feature and account&#10;for a significant fraction of the observed emission at mid-IR&#10;wavelengths, they are a major component of the total dust mass in the&#10;shell. Any additional component is equally well fitted by the other&#10;grain species we tested (see Table \[tab2\]), with the exception of&#10;carbon component, which results in a somewhat larger . This is due to&#10;the fact that the absorption coefficient for carbon grains (see&#10;Figure \[kappas\]) produces a somewhat flatter slope at longer&#10;wavelengths than indicated by the SPIRE data.">

  <outline text="Temperature" _note="The map in Figure \[dustmaps\] shows the temperature distribution of the&#10;grains. Since the grains at any given location will likely have a&#10;distribution of grain sizes, the temperature for any given pixel should&#10;be thought of as the average temperature for that location. The&#10;temperature of the dust in the shell ranges from 42 to 57 K, with an&#10;average temperature and standard deviation of 46 4 K. The plot in&#10;Figure \[dustplot\] shows the mass-temperature distribution in the&#10;shell, and indicates that most of the mass is actually emitting in a&#10;narrow temperature range of 43–52 K. This explains why the mass of the&#10;single-temperature warm component fit in Table \[tab2\] is similar to&#10;that found from the spatially resolved fit, unlike what would be&#10;expected for a very wide dust temperature distribution in the shell .&#10;&#10;The left panel of Figure \[dustmaps\] clearly shows that the temperature&#10;peaks at the location of the stars that are embedded in the shell,&#10;confirming that the stars are the primary heating sources for the&#10;surrounding dust. In order to verify that this is plausible, we compared&#10;the total luminosity of the eleven O and B stars in the shell analyzed&#10;by to the total luminosity of the IR SED seen in Figure \[dustfits\].&#10;Based on the spectral classification of the stars, we assume a&#10;luminosity of 25,000  for each star. We calculate an IR luminosity of&#10;the shell to be  9500 , which is only a small fraction of the total&#10;luminosity of the stars, approximately 3.5%. We note that there may be&#10;additional stars present inside the volume of the shell for which&#10;near-IR spectroscopy was not obtained by these authors. In particular,&#10;the bright extended region in the left panel of Figure \[3color\] that&#10;coincides with position 2 of the IRS slit and also shows up as a hot&#10;region in the dust temperature map in Figure \[dustmaps\] is likely&#10;heated by an early-type star identified by , but not studied by . The&#10;location of this star is marked by the green“x&quot; in Figure \[dustmaps\].&#10;This region also has a higher gas density that is likely produced by the&#10;compression of the ejecta material by the pulsar’s jet , but while the&#10;jet may contribute to some heating of the dust in this location, the&#10;dust temperature distribution and total luminosity imply that the stars&#10;are responsible for most of the heating.&#10;&#10;The results from the global SED fits in Table \[tab2\] show that all&#10;model combinations result in grains that are warmer on average than the&#10;secondary dust component of a different composition. While a physical&#10;dust heating model for the dust in the shell will be explored in a&#10;future publication, our preliminary model for heating of dust around a&#10;single B0V star confirms that the grains are heated to higher&#10;temperatures than carbon or silicate grains with comparable sizes. It&#10;furthermore shows that a typical grain size of the dust would need to be&#10;relatively large (on the order of  ) to achieve the temperatures&#10;produced by the best fits in Table \[tab2\].">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Mass" _note="The dust mass surface density map in the right panel of&#10;Figure \[dustmaps\] shows that the dust in the G54.1+0.3 is fairly&#10;uniformly distributed throughout the shell, with one region of&#10;enhancement corresponding to Region 1 of Figure \[3color\]. The dust&#10;mass associated with this enhancement is approximately  5% of the total&#10;dust mass in the shell. We note that this region does not coincide with&#10;the temperature peak at the western edge of the PWN where the gas&#10;density enhancement is found by , but instead seems to spatially&#10;coincide with the \[\] peak seen in Figure 11 of . The emission from&#10;this region was suggested to arise from ejecta material swept-up by the&#10;PWN .&#10;&#10;The best-fit total dust masses for various composition combinations are&#10;listed in Table \[tab2\]. We present the results that assume the&#10;long-wavelength emission originates from the shell, as well as the&#10;results that treat this emission as background emission. The models for&#10;which the mid-IR emission arises solely from grains produce unreasonably&#10;large best-fit dust masses that are inconsistent with nucleosynthetic&#10;yields for SN ejecta. This suggests that other grain species with higher&#10;emissivities at longer wavelengths are also present in the shell. When a&#10;secondary dust composition is included in the models, the best-fit dust&#10;masses are somewhat lower, but still higher than what might be expected&#10;for SN-condensed dust. For example, for models considering carbon,&#10;silicate, or alumina grains as secondary components, the best-fit dust&#10;masses range from 1.1-1.5 . However, since the temperature and mass of&#10;the secondary component are poorly constrained, the uncertainty on the&#10;total mass can be as high as  . The lower dust mass limit for the best&#10;fit models in Table \[tab2\] (the best-fit value minus the uncertainty)&#10;ranges from 0.26 to 1.0 , depending on the chosen composition of the&#10;secondary component. These lower limits are achieved when the flux&#10;density contribution of the secondary dust component to mid-IR&#10;wavelengths is at a maximum, which slightly raises the temperature and&#10;decreases the normalization of the primary dust component, effectively&#10;decreasing the total dust mass in the shell.&#10;&#10;We emphasize that the inferred dust masses are highly dependent on the&#10;model that we use to fit the SED. While our choice of grain compositions&#10;was motivated by the observed spectral feature and most common dust&#10;species arising from dust condensation models, the relative&#10;contributions and temperatures of the various dust component will need&#10;to be verified by physical dust heating models that properly take into&#10;account the radiation field produced by the stellar cluster and a&#10;distribution of dust grain sizes and temperatures. For example, a model&#10;that included radiative heating of dust grains with a continuous size&#10;distribution in the Crab Nebula resulted in a total dust mass that is a&#10;factor of two lower than for a two-temperature model that fits the data&#10;equally well and uses the same dust grain composition . In future work,&#10;it will be important to determine whether the parameter space produced&#10;by a heating model will allow for a significantly lower total dust mass&#10;in G54.1+0.3. Additional limitations and sources of uncertainty are&#10;discussed in Section \[caveats\].">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Caveats and Limitations" _note="The estimated dust masses in this work are highly dependent on the&#10;chosen model parameters and would vary with changes in the source&#10;distance and dust grain composition, shape, size distribution, porosity,&#10;and clumping. One of the main assumptions that drives the total dust&#10;mass is that the 21  feature and a significant fraction of the mid-IR&#10;continuum in the spectrum of the G54.1+0.3 shell arise from grains.&#10;Based on the available optical constants, this grain composition is the&#10;only one that reproduces the precise shape of the 21  feature . However,&#10;there may be other grain compositions with higher emissivities at&#10;wavelengths longward of this feature that reproduce it equally well,&#10;which would in turn lower the estimated dust mass.&#10;&#10;As mentioned in Section \[mass\], introducing a wide distribution of&#10;grain sizes, and therefore temperatures, may also affect the relative&#10;contribution of the various dust species to the global SED and change&#10;the derived dust mass. The dust mass would also change if the grains are&#10;porous or not spherical. While we cannot rule out porous grains in our&#10;model, studies of meteoritic grains that likely originate from SNe show&#10;that they are compact . Since compact grains were also used to estimate&#10;the the dust mass in of SN 1987A, for example, our estimate for&#10;G54.1+0.3 at least provides a relative dust mass in relation to those&#10;estimated for other SNRs that contain SN-condensed dust.&#10;&#10;Another matter of concern is the balance of heating and cooling of the&#10;dust in the shell. The IR observations show that only a small fraction&#10;of the stellar radiation is reradiated by the dust in the shell. While&#10;the available data on the UV absorption properties of grains in&#10;particular are incomplete, silicate grains in general are opaque at&#10;these wavelengths, so we would expect a much higher fraction of the&#10;stellar flux to be absorbed if the total dust mass exceeded a few tenths&#10;of solar masses. However, if the grains are indeed as large as 1  (see&#10;Section \[temp\]), their effective absorption per unit mass will be&#10;smaller, so the larger dust masses would likely not be in conflict with&#10;the inferred low value of the UV optical depth. A more detailed physical&#10;heating model will be necessary to resolve these ambiguities and&#10;determine whether including these additional effects will significantly&#10;alter the dust mass estimate for G54.1+0.3.">

<outline text="Discussion" _note="The fact that the dust in the G54.1+0.3 IR shell shows a fairly uniform&#10;spatial mass distribution and no evidence for enhancements at the&#10;locations of the stellar sources confirms that the point-like 24  excess&#10;(Figure \[3color\]) does not originate from dust intrinsic to the stars.&#10;The dust mass surface density map is consistent with the scenario in&#10;which the stars are heating a shell of dust that condensed from the SN&#10;ejecta. The lower mass limit of at least 0.26 of SN-formed dust derived&#10;from the SED fits would be the second largest observationally confirmed&#10;dust mass after SN 1987A , assuming that the grains are compact and that&#10;the grains are responsible for the observed 21  feature and a&#10;significant fraction of the mid-IR continuum (additional caveats are&#10;discussed in Section \[caveats\]). A large dust mass of 0.8 requiring a&#10;high condensation efficiency was also inferred for Cas A, accounting for&#10;the fact that some of the dust has already been destroyed by the reverse&#10;shock . The comparison of the estimated dust mass in G54.1+0.3 with&#10;nucleosynthetic yields implies a similarly high condensation efficiency.&#10;&#10;The PWN in G54.1+0.3 has not yet been overtaken by the SNR reverse&#10;shock, so it is not unexpected that the mass of the SN-formed dust is&#10;still high. Just how much of the observed dust will eventually survive&#10;the shock and be injected into the ISM remains uncertain. estimate that&#10;only 12–16% of dust grains will survive the passage of the reverse shock&#10;in Cas A. However, this percentage may be higher in the case of Type IIP&#10;progenitors that are expected to form larger grains that are not as&#10;easily destroyed. For example, in their models that account for the for&#10;the gas-phase chemistry, nucleation, and coagulation of grains, find&#10;that Type IIP SNe tend to form larger grains, especially if the ejecta&#10;are clumpy, and that ejecta clumpiness also leads to somewhat higher&#10;dust masses and a higher fraction of metallic grains. In addition, if&#10;the SN that produced G54.1+0.3 occurred in a low density bubble produced&#10;by the OB association, the reverse shock may be very weak once it&#10;encounters the SN-condensed dust that surrounds the PWN, leading to a&#10;higher survival rate of grains and a higher eventual dust mass input&#10;into the ISM. This hypothesis will need to be tested with more detailed&#10;modeling of the dust destruction by the SN reverse shock.&#10;&#10;In order to compare our estimated dust masses with nucleosynthetic&#10;yields, we list the yields of C, O, Mg, Al, and Si for different&#10;progenitor masses in Table \[tab3\], based on the models of and . The&#10;table also lists the maximum possible mass of , MgO + SiO, , and carbon&#10;dust that could form in the ejecta assuming a 100% condensation&#10;efficiency. The amount of is limited by the total number of the Mg or Si&#10;atoms, depending on whether is less or greater than 0.7. The mass of&#10;MgO+SiO2 assumes that all Mg and Si in the ejecta are locked up in MgO&#10;and SiO and/or one or more forms of grains. We compare these values to&#10;the lower dust mass limit in the G54.1+0.3 shell, listed in&#10;Table \[tab2\]. The lower mass limit of 0.25 of grains is consistent&#10;with nucleosynthetic constraints for a progenitor of at least  15 , but&#10;this requires a mass of  0.03 , which corresponds to a progenitor mass&#10;of at least 21 (see Table \[tab3\]). However, slightly increasing the&#10;mass of would decrease the required mass of and therefore lower this&#10;limit on the progenitor mass. The next lowest dust mass lower limit of&#10;0.28 is for the plus carbon dust model, and implies a progenitor mass of&#10;at least 16 .&#10;&#10;The primary composition of the grains may also offer some clues about&#10;the SN progenitor. For example, the grains that make up a large fraction&#10;of the dust are characterized by a Mg to Si ratio of 0.7. The sixth&#10;column of Table \[tab3\] lists the ratio of the numbers of Mg to Si&#10;atoms in the ejecta () for different progenitor masses. This ratio is&#10;less than unity for progenitor masses of  27  and below. A ratio below&#10;unity may explain the formation of the less common magnesium silicate&#10;grain species, such as , instead of the more common ones like forsterite&#10;(MgSiO) for which Mg/Si = 2. The mass and the composition of the grains&#10;in G54.1+0.3 therefore suggest that the mass of the SN progenitor was in&#10;the 16–27  range, consistent with the estimate of and the range of&#10;18–35  suggested by the analysis of the stellar cluster by . We note&#10;here that a dust condensation efficiency of 100% would lead to a more&#10;massive progenitor.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="We analyzed the 15–500  IR emission from a dusty shell of SN-formed dust&#10;surrounding the PWN in the SNR G54.1+0.3. We find that the SED, and in&#10;particular a spectral feature at 21 m, is well described by a dust&#10;composition of grains, with a secondary component possibly arising from&#10;carbon, silicate, or alumina grains. Through a spatially resolved&#10;analysis of the IR emission, we derive dust temperature and mass surface&#10;density maps that confirm the scenario in which stellar members of the&#10;SN progenitor’s cluster are the primary heating sources for the SN dust.&#10;The smallest total dust mass resulting from our models is 1.1  0.8 ,&#10;assuming compact grains and a distance of 6 kpc. Self-consistent&#10;radiative heating models that invoke a continues distribution of grain&#10;sizes may affect this estimate and allow for a lower mass. Nevertheless,&#10;the large quantity of dust inferred from our model implies a high dust&#10;condensation efficiency, as has been suggested for both SN 1987A and&#10;Cas A . A comparison of the dust mass and composition with&#10;nucleosynthetic yields suggests that G54.1+0.3 resulted from a 16–27 &#10;progenitor. Since the dusty shell has not yet been encountered by the SN&#10;reverse shock, the ultimate survival of the dust remains unclear. This&#10;study implies that dust can efficiently form in the ejecta of Type IIP&#10;SN explosions, and that certain classes of SNe may indeed be significant&#10;sources of dust in the Universe. Future high spatial resolution imaging&#10;and spectroscopic observations, particularly with the JAMES WEBB SPACE&#10;TELESCOPE, as well as detailed physical dust heating models will be&#10;necessary to confirm these results.&#10;&#10;This work is based in part on observations made with HERSCHEL.
