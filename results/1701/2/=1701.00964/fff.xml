    <title>Hamiltonian of mean force and a damped harmonic oscillator in an
anisotropic medium</title>
    <abstract>The quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator is investigated in
the presence of an anisotropic heat bath. The medium is modeled by a
continuum of three dimensional harmonic oscillators and anisotropic
coupling is treated by introducing tensor coupling functions. Starting
from a classical Lagrangian, the total system is quantized in the
framework of the canonical quantization. Following Fano technique,
Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized in terms of creation and
annihilation operators that are linear combinations of the basic
dynamical variables. Using the diagonalized Hamiltonian, the mean force
internal energy, free energy and entropy of the damped oscillator are
calculated. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Quantum damped harmonic oscillators appear in different branches of&#10;physics like condense matter , crystallin media and Quantum optics .&#10;Classical and quantum treatment of a damped harmonic oscillator has been&#10;extensively studied in .&#10;&#10;The first attempts to describe the quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic&#10;oscillator was to find a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian from which desired&#10;equations of motion be derived. In this approaches, the effects of&#10;external fields where considered implicitly classically by considering&#10;Lagrangian or Hamiltonian of the system to be explicitly time-dependent.&#10;These schemes lead to some inconsistencies in fundamental principles of&#10;quantum mechanics like the violation of Heisenberg equations of motion.&#10;There are several approaches to investigate the quantum dynamics of a&#10;damped harmonic oscillator. In one of these approaches, known as the&#10;phenomenological approach , the fundamental ingredient is the&#10;fluctuation- dissipation theorem . In this approach, the dissipation is&#10;introduced to the system by adding some physically acceptable terms to&#10;the equations of motion. Another approach known as system plus reservoir&#10;approach, is based on Huttner-Barnett method where dissipation is&#10;introduced by modeling the reservoir by a continuum of harmonic&#10;oscillators interacting with the main system . The idea of a continuum&#10;set of harmonic oscillators, originally appeared in , has been extended&#10;and applied in electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of a&#10;medium and also in related topics such as macroscopic quantum&#10;electrodynamics and Casimir Physics .&#10;&#10;The thermodynamic equilibrium free energy of an open quantum system in&#10;contact with a thermal environment is equal to the difference between&#10;the free energy of the total system and free energy of the solely&#10;environment . The Hamiltonian of mean force is the effective Hamiltonian&#10;describing the Boltezmann-Gibbs equilibrium of the probability density&#10;of the open quantum system of interest .&#10;&#10;In the present paper, we follow the second approach that is&#10;Huttner-Barnett approach and model the medium by a continuum of three&#10;dimensional harmonic oscillators. The anisotropic property is also taken&#10;into account by considering a tensorial or dyadic coupling function.&#10;Therefore, we start from a total Lagrangian and quantize the total&#10;system in the framework of canonical quantization. The Hamiltonian is&#10;diagonalized using Fano diagonalization technique . The response or&#10;memory function, known also as susceptibility function, obeys&#10;Kramers-Kronig relations and can be obtained in terms of dyadic coupling&#10;function and vice versa. The total system is assumed in a thermal&#10;equilibrium state and using the Hamiltonian of the mean force, the&#10;thermal-energy and free energy of the damped oscillator or main system&#10;are calculated in an anisotropic medium. The quantum dynamics of a&#10;damped harmonic oscillator in an isotropic medium has been discussed in&#10;.&#10;&#10;The layout of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II, a classical&#10;Lagrangian for the total system is introduced, Langevin type equations&#10;of motion for the main system and reservoir oscillators are obtained.&#10;The response function and its connection to the dyadic coupling function&#10;is also discussed in this section. In Sec. III, The total system is&#10;quantized in the framework of canonical quantization approach and&#10;Hamiltonian is diagonalized using Fano diagonalization technique. In&#10;Sec. IV, thermal correlation functions, Hamiltonian of mean force, mean&#10;force thermal energy, free energy and entropy of the system are&#10;obtained. Finally, conclusions are given in Sec. V.">

<outline text="Classical dynamics" _note="Following Huttner-Barnett approach, let us consider the total classical&#10;Lagrangian of the system plus reservoir as The first term is the&#10;Lagrangian of a unit mass harmonic oscillator or main system with&#10;displacement and frequency the second term, is the Lagrangian of a&#10;reservoir or heat bath consisting of a continuum of three dimensional&#10;harmonic oscillators with displacements and frequencies and the last&#10;term is the interaction term where the main oscillator is coupled to the&#10;reservoir oscillators linearly and anisotropic property of the medium is&#10;considered by introducing dyadic or tensorial coupling functions . For&#10;an isotropic medium we have . The classical equations of motion from&#10;Euler-Lagrange equations are and In equations (\[5\], \[6\]), the&#10;summation rule is applied over repeated indices. The formal solution of&#10;the equation (\[6\]) is the first term is the solution of the&#10;homogeneous equation and after quantization becomes a noise operator,&#10;the second term is the particular solution given by the Green’s function&#10;of the harmonic oscillator where is Heaviside step function. The&#10;dimensionless memory or response function is defined by The real and&#10;imaginary parts of Fourier transform of response function satisfy&#10;Kramers-Kronig relations. From definition (\[i0\]) and making use of&#10;inverse sine transform, one finds For convenience, from now we assume a&#10;symmetric coupling function (), then So for a given susceptibility&#10;function, one can adjust coupling function according to (\[CC\]). From&#10;(\[i0\]), we find where means principal value. Now by substituting&#10;(\[8\]) into (\[5\]), a classical Langevin equation is obtained for the&#10;main oscillator where is a classical noise force.">

<outline text="Quantum dynamics" _note="To quantize the system plus reservoir in the framework of canonical&#10;quantization scheme, we need canonical conjugate variables corresponding&#10;to the dynamical variables and . From total Lagrangian we have The&#10;quantization is achieved by imposing equal-time commutation relations&#10;and all other equal-time commutation relations are zero. The Hamiltonian&#10;of the total system is obtained as where is the dyadic coupling&#10;function. In Heisenberg picture, one finds the equations of motion as&#10;operator analogs of classical equations of motion (\[5\], \[6\]). To&#10;have a better understanding of the quantum dynamics of the system and&#10;also subsystems, we try to diagonalize the Hamiltonian using Fano&#10;diagonalization technique. Therefore, we assume that is the total&#10;Hamiltonian is assumed to be a continuum of uncoupled harmonic&#10;oscillators with creation and annihilation operators and , respectively.&#10;These ladder operators satisfy bosonic commutation relations where is a&#10;unit matrix. Generally, the annihilation operator , is a linear&#10;combination of the original dynamical degrees of freedom The following&#10;relations among coefficients can be determined from fundamental&#10;commutation relations From these equations we find easily Equations&#10;(\[gg1\], \[gg2\]) are similar to Eqs.(\[5\], \[6\]) in frequency&#10;domain, so using (\[8\]), the general solution of these equations can be&#10;written as where is an arbitrary tensorial function. The general&#10;solution for is where the Green’s function is defined by the inverse of&#10;the matrix and is the solution of The explicit form of the function can&#10;be determined from the commutation relations (\[66\]) and (\[73\]). One&#10;finds which has a simple solution We can also show that the&#10;diagonalizing transformation requires the choice The set of coefficients&#10;of the diagonalizing transformation is now determined by Eqs. (\[73\]),&#10;(\[75\]), (\[79\]) and (\[82\]). The canonical operators can also be&#10;expressed in terms of the annihilation and creation operators as">
