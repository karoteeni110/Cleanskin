    <title>Minimally-Supervised Attribute Fusion for Data Lakes</title>
    <abstract>Aggregate analysis, such as comparing country-wise sales versus global
market share across product categories, is often complicated by the
unavailability of common join attributes, e.g., category, across diverse
datasets from different geographies or retail chains, even after
disparate data is technically ingested into a common DATA LAKE.
Sometimes this is a missing data issue, while in other cases it may be
inherent, e.g., the records in different geographical databases may
actually describe different product ‘SKUs’, or follow different norms
for categorization. Record linkage techniques, such as can be used to
automatically map products in different data sources to a common set of
GLOBAL attributes, thereby enabling federated aggregation joins to be
performed. Traditional record-linkage techniques are typically
unsupervised, relying textual similarity features across attributes to
estimate matches. In this paper, we present an ensemble model combining
minimal supervision using Bayesian network models together with
unsupervised textual matching for automating such ‘attribute fusion’. We
present results of our approach on a large volume of real-life data from
a market-research scenario and compare with a standard record matching
algorithm. Finally we illustrate how attribute fusion using machine
learning could be included as a data-lake management feature, especially
as our approach also provides confidence values for matches, enabling
human intervention, if required. </abstract>
