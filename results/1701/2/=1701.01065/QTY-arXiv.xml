    <title>Min-max formulas and other properties of certain classes of nonconvex
effective Hamiltonians</title>
    <abstract>This paper is the first attempt to systematically study properties of
the effective Hamiltonian arising in the periodic homogenization of some
coercive but nonconvex Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Firstly, we introduce
a new and robust decomposition method to obtain min-max formulas for a
class of nonconvex . Secondly, we analytically and numerically
investigate other related interesting phenomena, such as
“quasi-convexification" and breakdown of symmetry, of from other typical
nonconvex Hamiltonians. Finally, in the appendix, we show that our new
method and those a priori formulas from the periodic setting can be used
to obtain stochastic homogenization for same class of nonconvex
Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Some conjectures and problems are also
proposed. </abstract>

  <outline text="Overview" _note="Let us describe the periodic homogenization theory of Hamilton-Jacobi&#10;equations. For each , let be the viscosity solution to Here, the&#10;Hamiltonian is of separable form with , which is coercive (i.e., ), and&#10;, which is -periodic. The initial data , the set of bounded, uniformly&#10;continuous functions on .&#10;&#10;It was proven by Lions, Papanicolaou and Varadhan that converges to&#10;locally uniformly on as , and solves the effective equation The&#10;effective Hamiltonian is determined in a nonlinear way by and through&#10;the cell problems as following. For each , it was shown in that there&#10;exists a unique constant such that the following cell problem has a&#10;continuous viscosity solution where is the -dimensional flat torus .&#10;&#10;Although there is a vast literature on homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi&#10;equations in different settings after , characterizing the shape of&#10;remains largely open even in basic situations. Let us summarize quickly&#10;what is known in the literature about . It is not hard to see that is&#10;coercive thanks to the coercivity of . If one assumes furthermore that&#10;is convex, then is also convex and the graph of can contain some flat&#10;parts (i.e., has interior points). See and the works of Concordel .&#10;Furthermore, in this convex setting, we have the following&#10;representation formula, thanks to the results of Contreras, Iturriaga,&#10;Paternain and Paternain , and Gomes , Note that the above representative&#10;formula still holds if is quasiconvex (level-set convex), in which case&#10;is also quasiconvex. More interestingly, in case , and , a deep result&#10;of Bangert says that the level curve for every must contain line&#10;segments (i.e., not strictly convex) unless is a constant function.&#10;Bangert’s result relies on detailed information about the structure of&#10;Aubry-Mather sets in two dimension (). See also Jing, Tran, Yu for&#10;discussion regarding locations of line segments of the level curves for&#10;Mañé type Hamiltonians.&#10;&#10;The first numerical computation of effective Hamiltonians is due to Qian&#10;based on the so called [BIG-T METHOD]{}, that is, , where is the unique&#10;viscosity solution to For other numerical schemes, we refer to Gomes,&#10;Oberman , Falcone, Rorro , Achdou, Camilli, Capuzzo-Dolcetta , Oberman,&#10;Takei, Vladimirsky , Luo, Yu, Zhao and the references therein.&#10;&#10;It is worth mentioning that cell problem and representation formula&#10;appear also in weak KAM theory (see E , Evans, Gomes , Fathi for the&#10;convex case, and Cagnetti, Gomes, Tran for the nonconvex case). In fact,&#10;a central goal of the weak KAM theory is to find information of&#10;underlying dynamical system encoded in the effective Hamiltonian.&#10;&#10;In the case where is nonconvex, to identify the shape of is highly&#10;nontrivial even in the one dimensional space. This was settled only very&#10;recently by Armstrong, Tran, Yu , and Gao . One fundamental feature&#10;obtained is the “[QUASI-CONVEXIFICATION]{}&quot; phenomenon, that is, the&#10;effective Hamiltonian becomes quasiconvex (level-set convex) when the&#10;oscillation of is large enough. See Section \[sec:quasi\] for more&#10;precise statements. In multi-dimensional spaces, Armstrong, Tran, Yu&#10;obtained a qualitative shape of for a representative case where . Other&#10;than , very little is known about finer properties of nonconvex in&#10;multi-dimensional spaces, partly due to the extreme complexity of&#10;dynamics associated with nonconvex Hamiltonians. Furthermore, as far as&#10;the authors know, there is no numerical study of in this case.&#10;&#10;Let us also call attention to an extrinsic way to study via inverse&#10;problems.

  <outline text="Main results" _note="Reducing a complex quantity to relatively simpler objects is a very&#10;natural and common idea in mathematics. For a class of nonconvex&#10;Hamiltonians , we introduce a new decomposition method to obtain min-max&#10;type representation formulas for . These formulas consist of effective&#10;Hamiltonians of quasiconvex Hamiltonians which are presumably less&#10;challenging to analyze. The most general statement is given by inductive&#10;formulas (Theorem \[Maintheorem\]). Two specific (but important) cases&#10;of Theorem \[Maintheorem\] are provided in Theorem \[thm:rep1\] and&#10;Lemma \[thm:rep2\]. One immediate corollary is the evenness of&#10;associated with a certain class of radially symmetric Hamiltonians,&#10;which is otherwise not obvious at all. Given the vast variety of&#10;nonconvex functions, our surgical approach is only a preliminary step&#10;toward understanding the shape of nonconvex . In Section 2.4, we present&#10;some natural obstacles to decomposing a nonconvex . In particular, there&#10;is a connection between “non-decomposability&quot; and loss of evenness.&#10;&#10;As another interesting application, the method and the representation&#10;formulas are robust enough that we are also able to prove stochastic&#10;homogenization for the same class of nonconvex in the appendix. For&#10;instance, Theorem \[thm:random\] includes the result in as a special&#10;case with a much shorter proof. The detailed discussion on this&#10;(including a brief overview of stochastic homogenization) is left to the&#10;appendix. We would like to point out that a priori identification of&#10;shape of is currently the only available way to tackle homogenization of&#10;nonconvex Hamilton-Jacobi equations in general stationary ergodic&#10;setting.&#10;&#10;In Section 3, we provide various numerical computations of in&#10;multi-dimensional spaces for general radially symmetric Hamiltonians and&#10;a double-well type Hamiltonian. These provide insights on how the&#10;changes of potential energy affect the changes in shape of effective&#10;Hamiltonian . The important “quasi-convexification&quot; phenomenon is&#10;observed in multi-dimensional cases as well. Nevertheless, verifying it&#10;rigorously seems to be quite challenging. Interesting connections&#10;between decomposition, loss of evenness and quasi-convexification are&#10;demonstrated in Section 2.4 and Remark \[rem:conj\]. Several open&#10;problems are provided based on the numerical evidences we have in this&#10;section.">

Let us first give a brief overview of stochastic&#10;homogenization.">
  <outline text="Brief overview of stochastic homogenization" _note="Let be a probability space. Suppose that is a measure-preserving&#10;translation group action of on which satisfies that&#10;&#10;([**Semi-group property**]{})&#10;&#10;([**Ergodicity**]{}) For any ,&#10;&#10;The potential is assumed to be stationary, bounded and uniformly&#10;continuous. More precisely, for all and , and for some function&#10;satisfying .&#10;&#10;For , denote as the unique viscosity solution to Here is coercive. A&#10;basic question is whether , as , converges to the solution to an&#10;effective deterministic equation (\[HJ-hom\]) almost surely as in the&#10;periodic setting.&#10;&#10;The stochastic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations has received&#10;much attention in the last seventeen years. The first results were due&#10;to Rezakhanlou and Tarver and Souganidis , who independently proved&#10;convergence results for general convex, first-order Hamilton-Jacobi&#10;equations in stationary ergodic setting. These results were extended to&#10;the viscous case with convex Hamiltonians by Kosygina, Rezakhanlou and&#10;Varadhan and, independently, by Lions and Souganidis . New proofs of&#10;these results based on the notion of intrinsic distance functions&#10;(maximal subsolutions) appeared later in Armstrong and Souganidis for&#10;the first-order case and in Armstrong and Tran for the viscous case. See&#10;Davini, Siconolfi , Armstrong, Souganidis for homogenization of&#10;quasiconvex, first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations.&#10;&#10;One of the prominent open problems in the field is to prove/disprove&#10;homogenization in the genuinely nonconvex setting. In , Armstrong, Tran&#10;and Yu showed that, for , homogenizes in all space dimensions . In the&#10;next paper , Armstrong, Tran and Yu proved that, for , homogenizes for&#10;general coercive . Gao generalized the result in to the general non&#10;separable Hamiltonians in one space dimension. [A COMMON STRATEGY IN&#10;PAPERS IS TO IDENTIFY THE SHAPE OF IN THE PERIODIC SETTING FIRST AND&#10;THEN RECOVER IT IN THE STATIONARY ERGODIC SETTING. ]{} In particular, in&#10;contrast to previous works, our strategy does not depend on finding some&#10;master ergodic quantities suitable for subadditive ergodic theorems.&#10;Such kind of ergodic quantities may not exist at all for genuinely&#10;nonconvex .&#10;&#10;Ziliotto gave a counterexample to homogenization of in case . See also&#10;the paper by Feldman and Souganidis . Basically, show that, if has a&#10;strict saddle point, then there exists a potential energy such that is&#10;not homogenizable.&#10;&#10;Based on min-max formulas established in Section \[sec:min-max\], we&#10;prove that, for the Hamiltonians appear in Theorem \[thm:rep1\],&#10;Corollary \[cor:rep3\], Lemma \[thm:rep2\], and Theorem \[Maintheorem\],&#10;is always regularly homogenizable in all space dimensions . See the&#10;precise statements in Theorems \[thm:random\], \[thm:random-m\], and&#10;Corollary \[cor:random\] in Subsection \[sec:stoc-main\]. Theorem&#10;\[thm:random\] includes the result in as a special case. Also, the&#10;result of Corollary \[cor:random\] implies that, in some specific cases,&#10;even if has strict saddle points, is still regularly homogenizable for&#10;every with large oscillation. See the comments after its statement and&#10;some comparison between this result and the counterexamples in .&#10;&#10;The authors tend to believe that a prior identification of the shape of&#10;might be necessary in order to tackle homogenization in the general&#10;stationary ergodic setting. In certain special random environment like&#10;finite range dependence (i.i.d), the homogenization was established for&#10;a class of Hamiltonians in interesting works of Armstrong, Cardaliaguet&#10;, Feldman, Souganidis . Their proofs are based on completely different&#10;philosophy and, in particular, rely on specific properties of the random&#10;media.&#10;&#10;In the viscous case (i.e., adding to equation (\[RamHJ-eq\])), the&#10;stochastic homogenization problem for nonconvex Hamiltonians is more&#10;formidable. For example, the homogenization has not even been proved or&#10;disproved for simple cases like in one dimension. Min-max formulas in&#10;the inviscid case are in general not available here due to the nonlocal&#10;effect (or regularity) from the viscous term. Nevertheless, see a&#10;preliminary result in one dimensional space by Davini and Kosygina .&#10;&#10;The following definition was first introduced in .&#10;&#10;\[regularhomo\] We say that is regularly homogenizable if for every ,&#10;there exists a unique constant such that, for every and for a.s. , Here,&#10;for , is the unique bounded viscosity solution to&#10;&#10;According to Lemma 5.1 in , is equivalent to saying that for a.s. ,&#10;Clearly, if is regularly homogenizable, then random homogenization&#10;holds, that is, solution of converges to , the solution to with defined&#10;by , as .">

  <outline text="Stochastic homogenization results" _note="The main claim is that is regularly homogenizable provided that is of a&#10;form in Theorem \[thm:rep1\], Corollary \[cor:rep3\], Lemma&#10;\[thm:rep2\], and Theorem \[Maintheorem\]. The proof is basically a&#10;repetition of arguments in the proofs of the aforementioned results&#10;except that the cell problem in the periodic setting is replaced by the&#10;discount ergodic problem in the random environment. This is because of&#10;the fact that the cell problem in the random environment might not have&#10;sublinear solutions at all. Here are the precise statements of the&#10;results.&#10;&#10;\[thm:random\] Assume that satisfies [(H1)–(H3)]{}. Assume further that&#10;. Then is regularly homogenizable and&#10;&#10;As mentioned, this theorem includes the result in as a special case. An&#10;important corollary of this theorem is the following:&#10;&#10;\[cor:random\] Let be a coercive Hamiltonian satisfying [(H1)–(H3)]{},&#10;except that we do not require to be quasiconcave. Assume that , , and&#10;Then is regularly homogenizable and In particular, is quasiconvex in&#10;this situation.&#10;&#10;It is worth emphasizing that we do not require any structure of in&#10;except that there. In particular, is allowed to have strict saddle&#10;points in . Therefore, Corollary \[cor:random\] implies that, in some&#10;specific cases, even if has strict saddle points, is still regularly&#10;homogenizable provided that the oscillation of is large enough. In a&#10;way, this is a situation when the potential energy has much power to&#10;overcome the depths of all the wells created by the kinetic energy and&#10;it “irons out&quot; all the nonconvex pieces to make quasiconvex. This also&#10;confirms that the counterexamples in are only for the case that has&#10;small oscillation, in which case only sees the local structure of around&#10;its strict saddle points, but not its global structure.&#10;&#10;Let us now state the most general result in this stochastic&#10;homogenization context that we have.&#10;&#10;\[thm:random-m\] Assume that [(H6)]{} holds for some . Assume further&#10;that , . Then and are regularly homogenizable. Moreover, (\[mainfor-1\])&#10;and (\[mainfor-2\]) hold in this random setting as well and In&#10;particular, and are both even. Here we use same notations as in Theorem&#10;\[Maintheorem\].&#10;&#10;We also have the following conjecture which was proven to be true in one&#10;dimension .&#10;&#10;\[conj:ran\] Assume that is continuous and coercive. Set for . Then is&#10;regularly homogenizable.&#10;&#10;We believe that Conjecture \[conj:convex\] should play a significant&#10;role in proving the above conjecture as in the one dimensional case. An&#10;initial step might be to obtain stochastic homogenization for the&#10;specific satisfying (H8). Below is closely related elementary question&#10;&#10;\[quest3\] Let be a periodic semi-concave (or semi-convex) function.&#10;Denote as the collection of all regular gradients, that is, Is a&#10;connected set?&#10;&#10;The periodic assumption is essential. Otherwise, it is obviously false,&#10;e.g., for .

  <outline text="Proof of Theorem [thm:random]" _note="As a demonstration, we only provide the proof of Theorem \[thm:random\]&#10;in details here. The extension to Theorem \[thm:random-m\] is clear.&#10;Compared with the proof for the special case in , the following proof is&#10;much clearer and simpler.&#10;&#10;We need the following comparison result.&#10;&#10;\[lem:comparison\] Fix .

It is clear that Once again, we divide&#10;our proof into few steps.&#10;&#10;[**Step 1.**]{} Assume that .

We proceed in the same way as in Step 1&#10;(except that we use instead of because of the quasiconcavity of ) to get&#10;that Compare this to Step 3 in the proof of Theorem \[thm:rep1\] for&#10;similarity.&#10;&#10;[**Step 3.**]{} We now consider the case . Our goal is to show This step&#10;basically shares the same philosophy as Step 4 in the proof of Theorem&#10;\[thm:rep1\].
