    <title>Meromorphic solutions of algebraic difference equations</title>
    <abstract>It is shown that the difference equation where and are meromorphic
functions, possesses a continuous limit to the differential equation
which extends to solutions in certain cases. In addition, if possesses
two distinct transcendental meromorphic solutions, it is shown that
these solutions satisfy an algebraic relation, and that their growth
behaviors are almost same in the sense of Nevanlinna under some
conditions. Examples are given to discuss the sharpness of the results
obtained. These properties are counterparts of the corresponding results
on the algebraic differential equation . </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="According to the classical Malmquist’s theorem , if the differential&#10;equation where is rational in both arguments, has a transcendental&#10;meromorphic solution, then reduces into a Riccati equation. Steinmetz ,&#10;Bank and Kaufman have generalized Malmquist’s result by showing that the&#10;equation where again is rational in both arguments, reduces into one in&#10;a list of six simple differential equations, after a suitable Möbius&#10;transformation. One of these six equations is where are constants and&#10;and are rational functions. Equation can be transformed into by a simple&#10;linear transformation, provided that the coefficient is a constant.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we are concerned with meromorphic solutions of a&#10;difference equation of the form where and are meromorphic functions, and&#10;is the difference operator . We will show in Section \[limitSec\] below&#10;that possesses a continuous limit to , which, in some cases, extends to&#10;an explicit limit between the solutions of and , as well. In addition,&#10;we consider the order of growth and the value distribution of a&#10;meromorphic solution of , see e.g., , ,  for a description of&#10;Nevanlinna’s value distribution theory. One of the questions to be&#10;considered is whether holds for distinct meromorphic solutions and of ,&#10;where is an exceptional set with finite logarithmic measure. In , an&#10;algebraic relation for distinct meromorphic solutions to differential&#10;equation is obtained, which yields that is satisfied for any distinct&#10;transcendental meromorphic solutions to in place of , . We discuss this&#10;result in more detail in Section \[periodicSec\] below.&#10;&#10;Nevanlinna growth considerations of an equation related to were&#10;considered by Liu in in the following sense. Equation  can be also&#10;written in the form which belongs to a class of algebraic difference&#10;equations of first order, where and are polynomials in with meromorphic&#10;coefficients. Assume that all coefficients in are rational functions and&#10;possesses a transcendental meromorphic solution of finite order. Suppose&#10;in addition that and (or ). Then, by means of the difference analogues&#10;of the lemma on the logarithmic derivatives, has infinitely many poles,&#10;see e.g., , , . On the other hand, by the power test for poles of a&#10;meromorphic solution to , has only finitely many poles. This&#10;contradiction implies that has no meromorphic solution of finite order,&#10;that is a generalization of Yanagihara’s theorem  in some sense. By&#10;following this argument, and by using an extension of the the difference&#10;analogues of the lemma on the logarithmic derivatives obtained in , it&#10;follows that does not have any transcendental meromorphic solutions of&#10;hyper-order .&#10;&#10;This paper consists of five sections. In Section \[examplesSec\], we&#10;give several examples of . Section \[limitSec\] is devoted to showing&#10;that can be obtained from by a continuous limit, which also extends to&#10;solutions under some conditions. We consider the case when and are&#10;periodic functions of period 1 in Section \[periodicSec\]. An algebraic&#10;relation among solutions to is discussed. With some conditions in&#10;Section \[VG\] it is shown that holds for transcendental meromorphic&#10;solutions to .&#10;&#10;\[rem1.1\] We consider the case and are constants in . For a solution to&#10;, we define , where is a periodic function of period 1. Substituting in&#10;in place of , we see that is also a solution of , since . This means&#10;that the order of may be bigger than the order of , and hence is not&#10;always valid in general.">

<outline text="Continuous limit" _note="In this section we apply continuous limits to give connections between&#10;solutions of certain classes of difference equations and solutions of&#10;the corresponding differential equations. Shimomura  applied the&#10;continuous limit from the discrete second Painlevé equation to the&#10;second differential Painlevé equation in order to observe asymptotic&#10;expansions of solutions. Continuous limit has been contributed mostly to&#10;Painlevé analysis, e.g., , , . In , the difference Riccati equation was&#10;discussed.&#10;&#10;By a continuous limit we mean broadly the following. Let be a positive&#10;integer. We consider a difference equation Let be a complex number. We&#10;set a pair of relations According to , we transform to a certain&#10;difference equation with some conditions on coefficients of . Letting ,&#10;we derive a differential equation Depending on the conditions on&#10;coefficients, the arguments above give wide scope of ideas. On the other&#10;hand, it would remain generally within the framework of the formal&#10;discussion.&#10;&#10;We discuss next a continuous limit from to . To do this, we set in and&#10;give and in place of and , respectively. Since , we have Assume that&#10;Letting , we see that , if exists, satisfies the differential equation&#10;with and . If we set then this builds a DIRECT CONNECTION. When we do&#10;not assume , we call the derivation an INDIRECT CONNECTION. We compare&#10;these connections in Examples \[ex3.1\] and \[ex3.2\] below.&#10;&#10;\[ex3.1\] We observe in Example \[2.4\] in view of the continuous limit&#10;assuming the condition , i.e., a direct connection. According to and ,&#10;we derive a difference equation of the form from . We compute and which&#10;implies that and . The corresponding equation given by possesses a&#10;solution , where is an arbitrary constant. By and , we have which&#10;corresponds to if would hold for some , . In fact, we assume that is a&#10;non-constant meromorphic periodic function of period 1. Since is&#10;transcendental, has infinitely many zeros , for fixed and with at most&#10;two exceptions. Then we define , which implies the assertion.&#10;&#10;\[ex3.2\] Consider in Example \[2.2\]. Here we do not assume the&#10;condition , i.e., we are aiming for an indirect connection. By , the&#10;difference equation is transformed We set in place of in , where , and&#10;in place of in . Then we obtain a difference equation corresponding to&#10;The function satisfies , which is confirmed by the formula . Assume that&#10;. Then letting in , we see that satisfies a differential equation&#10;corresponding to with and , i.e., Applying an indirect connection, we&#10;can start to discuss a difference equation which has close properties to&#10;a differential equation . This argument could yield various discoveries.&#10;On the other hand, indirect connections might lose some properties of&#10;the original difference equation . For example, a transcendental&#10;meromorphic solution to given by possesses infinitely many poles.&#10;However, any transcendental meromorphic solution of has no poles.&#10;&#10;Most of the continuous limits obtained so far in the literature, see,&#10;e.g., and the reference therein, are indirect.">

Remark \[rem1.1\] implies that , or an&#10;identity like it, cannot be obtained in general for all pairs of&#10;distinct solutions to , since there may exist solutions to of distinct&#10;order of growth. However, we are still interested in whether there&#10;exists an algebraic relation for solutions to under some conditions. In&#10;the case of periodic coefficients, we have&#10;&#10;\[thm4.1\] Suppose that and are periodic functions of period 1 in , and&#10;suppose that possesses distinct transcendental meromorphic solutions and&#10;such that , .

If both and are periodic functions of&#10;period , then the Casoratian vanishes and does not hold.&#10;&#10;\[ex4.1\] Suppose that , in Example \[ex2.1\]. Then and are not periodic&#10;functions of period 2, and the Casoratian . In this case and . The&#10;relation now reduces to i.e., .">
