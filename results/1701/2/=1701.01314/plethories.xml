    <title>Classification of plethories in characteristic zero</title>
    <abstract>We classify plethories over fields of characteristic zero, thus
answering a question of Borger-Wieland and Bergman. All plethories over
characteristic zero fields are linear, in the sense that they are free
plethories on a bialgebra. For the proof we need some facts from the
theory of ring schemes where we extend previously known results. We also
classify plethories with trivial Verschiebung over a perfect field of
non-zero characteristic and indicate future work. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Plethories, first introduced by Tall-Wraith , and then studied by&#10;Borger-Wieland , are precisely the objects which act on -algebras, for a&#10;commutative ring. There are many fundamental questions regarding&#10;plethories which remain unanswered. One such question is, given a ring&#10;whether one can classify plethories over in this paper we will take a&#10;first step towards a classification.\&#10;For some motivation, let us start by looking at the category of modules&#10;over a commutative ring If we consider the category of representable&#10;functors there is a monoidal structure given by composition of functors.&#10;Then one defines a -algebra as a -module together with a comonad&#10;structure on the representable endofunctor with respect to composition&#10;of functors. Heuristically, this says that a -algebra is precisely the&#10;kind of object which knows how to act on -modules. This can be extended&#10;to a non-linear setting, so that instead of looking at -modules we look&#10;at -algebras and consider representable endofunctors A comonoid with&#10;respect to composition of functors is then called a plethory and&#10;analogously, a plethory is what knows how to act on -algebras. One&#10;particular important example of a plethory is the -algebra which consist&#10;of the ring of symmetric functions in infinitely many variables with a&#10;certain biring structure. The functor represents the functor taking a&#10;ring to its ring of Witt vectors. Using plethories one gets a very&#10;conceptual view of Witt vectors and in James Borger develops the&#10;geometry of Witt vectors using the plethystic perspective.\&#10;Let now be a field. If we let denote the category of plethories over&#10;there is a forgetful functor into the category of cocommutative counital&#10;bialgebras over This functor has a left adjoint and we say that a&#10;plethory is linear if for some cocommutative, counital bialgebra&#10;Heuristically, a plethory is linear if every action of on an algebra&#10;comes from an action of a bialgebra on The main theorem of this paper&#10;is:&#10;&#10;Let be a field of characteristic zero. Then any -plethory is linear.&#10;&#10;This answers a question of Bergman-Hausknecht and Borger-Wieland in the&#10;positive. The theorem is proved by studying the category of affine ring&#10;schemes. We have the following results, extending those of Greenberg to&#10;arbitrary fields and not necesarily reduced schemes:&#10;&#10;Let be a field. Then any connected ring scheme of finite type is&#10;unipotent.&#10;&#10;Let be a connected ring scheme of finite type over Then is affine.&#10;&#10;For the case of characteristic our classification results on plethories&#10;are not as complete and further work is needed to have a complete&#10;classification. To explain our classification results here we need some&#10;definitions. Let be the Frobenius homomorphism of and be the&#10;non-commutative ring which as underlying set is and has multiplication&#10;given by and We define to be the category of cocommutative, counital&#10;bialgebras over which also are modules over Once again, for a plethory&#10;over a perfect field of char there is a forgetful functor which has a&#10;left adjoint Call a plethory -linear if for some We have then the&#10;following classification result:&#10;&#10;Let be a perfect field of characteristic Assume that is a plethory over&#10;such that the Verschiebung Then is -linear.&#10;&#10;The structure of this paper is as follows. In section we study ring&#10;schemes and prove some results which we will need for our classification&#10;theorem. The main theorems of this section that are needed for later&#10;purposes are Theorem \[ringunipotent\] and Theorem \[ringfiltered\]. In&#10;section we introduce plethories and -birings and provide some examples.&#10;This section contains no new results and gives just a brief introduction&#10;to the relevant objects as defined in Borger-Wieland . In section we&#10;prove that all plethories over a field of characteristic zero is linear&#10;using the results from section We also show that any -biring is&#10;connected. In section we prove some initial classification results&#10;regarding plethories in characteristic">

<outline text="Ring schemes" _note="Let be a commutative ring. Recall that is a ring scheme over if is a&#10;scheme together with a lift of the functor to We say that a ring scheme&#10;is a -algebra scheme if the lift factors through the category of&#10;-algebras. We will mostly be concerned with affine ring schemes. Ring&#10;schemes were studied by Greenberg in and he showed that for connected,&#10;reduced ring schemes of finite type over an algebraically closed field&#10;the underlying scheme is always affine. Further, he shows that the&#10;underlying group variety is always unipotent. We improve on these&#10;results by showing that any connected ring schemes of finite type over&#10;an arbitrary field is affine, and that the underlying group scheme is&#10;always unipotent. From now on, in this section, is always a field.&#10;&#10;A -scheme is anti-affine if We say that a group scheme is anti-affine if&#10;its underlying scheme is anti-affine&#10;&#10;For example, abelian varieties are all anti-affine group schemes. An&#10;anti-affine group scheme has the property that any morphism from it into&#10;an affine group scheme is trivial. Anti-affine groups are very important&#10;for the structure of group schemes as the following theorem shows:&#10;&#10;\[[]{}\] \[Brionstructure\] If is a group scheme of finite type over a&#10;field there is an exact sequence of group schemes such that is&#10;anti-affine and is affine.&#10;&#10;We will now want to show that all connected finite type ring schemes are&#10;affine, i.e that in the above exact sequence For this, we will need the&#10;following lemma.&#10;&#10;Let be -schemes with quasi-compact and anti-affine and locally&#10;noetherian and irreducible.Suppose that is a morphism such that there&#10;exist k-rational points such that for all Then for all&#10;&#10;see .&#10;&#10;\[ringaffine\] Let be a connected ring scheme of finite type over Then&#10;is affine.&#10;&#10;We know by Theorem \[Brionstructure\] that sits in the middle of an&#10;extension of an affine group scheme by an anti-affine group. Let be the&#10;corresponding extension where is anti-affine and the affine quotient.&#10;Since is of finite type, is a ring scheme. This follows from the fact&#10;that if are quasi-compact -schemes, then the obvious map is an&#10;isomorphism (see ). This implies that defines an ideal scheme in i.e for&#10;all rings over is an ideal of Now, we will apply the above lemma with&#10;(note that is irreducible) and Taking and to be the rational points&#10;corresponding to the additive identity of and respectively, we have that&#10;is identically equal to zero. Thus, we have that is identically zero.&#10;But, letting be the rational point corresponding to the multiplicative&#10;identity of we have that is zero. But multiplication by is always&#10;injective, and thus, is trivial and is affine.&#10;&#10;We don’t know if the condition for to be of finite type is necessary in&#10;\[ringaffine\]. Let us recall the following definition from the theory&#10;of algebraic groups.&#10;&#10;Let be a commutative group scheme over . We say that is unipotent if it&#10;is affine and if every non-zero closed subgroup of admits a non-zero&#10;homomorphism&#10;&#10;The data of a homomorphism is the same as specifying an element in the&#10;underlying Hopf algebra of that satisfies i.e specifying a primitive&#10;element. If is an affine group scheme and the Hopf algebra associated to&#10;then saying that is unipotent is the same as saying that it is&#10;coconnected (or conilpotent). The following definition will be useful&#10;for the proof of Theorem \[ringunipotent\].&#10;&#10;Let be a commutative affine group scheme over a field. We say that is&#10;multiplicative if every homomorphism is zero.&#10;&#10;An example of a multiplicative group is There can in general be no&#10;homomorphism from a multiplicative group into a unipotent group and no&#10;morphisms from a unipotent group to a multiplicative group (for a proof,&#10;see ).\&#10;The following theorem was shown for reduced ring varieties over an&#10;algebraically closed fields by Greenberg, but the results carry over for&#10;perfect fields without any modification. We improve on this by carrying&#10;through the proof when is not necesarily reduced and over any field .&#10;Further,the theorem can be extended to ring schemes not necesarily of&#10;finite type if the ring scheme is already known to be affine.&#10;&#10;\[ringunipotent\] Over a field all connected ring schemes of finite type&#10;are unipotent.&#10;&#10;By Theorem \[ringaffine\], a connected ring scheme is affine. We know&#10;that contains a greatest multiplicative subgroup that has the property&#10;that for all endomorphisms of (where is the base change of to ) for a&#10;-algebra, that (). Thus, since any defines an endomorphism of (as a&#10;group scheme) through multiplication by we have that is an ideal of It&#10;is known that any action of a connected algebraic group on a&#10;multiplicative group must be trivial, i.e for connected and&#10;multiplicative, a map must have image the identity. We will need the&#10;following, which says that any map where is any connected group scheme&#10;and is multiplicative is trivial. This is basically just deduced,&#10;mutatis mutandis, from the proof of . So, we see that and defines the&#10;same endomorphisms on the ideal scheme But this is only the case if&#10;&#10;To extend this to all connected ring schemes, we need the following:&#10;&#10;\[ringfiltered\] Let be a field and be an affine ring scheme over Then&#10;is a filtered limit of ring schemes of finite type.&#10;&#10;The following proof is inspired by the analogue theorem for Hopf&#10;algebras over a field, as occurs in for example Milne . Write We know&#10;that is a bialgebra and we see that we can reduce to proving that any is&#10;contained in a sub-bialgebra of finite type. Let be the coaddition&#10;giving the additive group structure on and the comultiplication defining&#10;the multiplication on Consider with and linearly independent. Now, by&#10;the fundamental theorem of coalgebras, we know that if we take to be the&#10;subspace of generated by then this is a subcoalgebra, i.e that Now, for&#10;each in this system, consider with and linearly independent. With the&#10;same arguments, one sees that for the subspace generated by we have Let&#10;now be subalgebra generated by the finite-dimensional subspace spanned&#10;by We claim that actually is closed under both the operation and It is&#10;clear that and the same holds for coaddition. It is also easy to verify&#10;that We will now prove that and for this, consider the following diagram&#10;which is easily verified if we reverse all arrows and think of it in&#10;terms of rings.\&#10;&#10;A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\&#10;A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\&#10;A\_ A\_ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\&#10;A\_ A\_ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\&#10;A\_ (A\_ A\_) (A\_ A\_) A \_ &amp; A\_ A\_\&#10;(A\_ A\_) A\_ A\_ (A\_ A\_) &amp; (A\_ A\_) A\_\&#10;A\_ A\_ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_ A\_ A&#10;&#10;\&#10;\&#10;Here is the multiplication map and swithces the factors. What the&#10;diagram is saying, is just relating different ways of forming for in a&#10;ring. So this says, that Now, since are independent, this means that and&#10;by linear independence of each this means that Now, let be the&#10;sub-algebra generated by where is the antipode. It is easily verified&#10;that and that follows from the identity We thus see that is a bialgebra&#10;and we are done.&#10;&#10;Any affine connected ring scheme over a field is unipotent.&#10;&#10;Indeed, we know that we can write where ranges over ring schemes of&#10;finite type. Now, unipotence is stable under inverse limits and this&#10;immediately gives that is unipotent.">

<outline text="Classification of plethories over a field of characteristic zero." _note="In this section we will prove that all plethories over a field of&#10;characteristic zero are linear. This question was asked by&#10;Bergman-Hausknecht and Borger-Wieland . To understand what it means for&#10;a plethory to be linear, we will introduce some terminology.&#10;&#10;Let be a cocommutative bialgebra (not necesarily commutative) over with&#10;comultiplication Then there is a free -plethory on over The underlying&#10;algebra structure is the symmetric algebra on and the coaddition is&#10;induced from the map sending to The comultiplication is similarily&#10;induced from The plethysm is given by where is the multiplication on&#10;Among the pairs consisting of a plethory and a morphism of bialgebras&#10;the pair and is initial with this property.&#10;&#10;Call a plethory linear if for some bialgebra The reason for calling it&#10;linear is that if for some bialgebra then Let us note now that by&#10;Theorem \[ringunipotent\] any connected ring scheme of finite type is&#10;unipotent. Over (or more generally any field of characteristic zero) all&#10;group schemes are reduced by a theorem of Cartier. We say that a group&#10;scheme is étale if is a finite scheme and geometrically reduced. This is&#10;equivalent to asking for the underlying Hopf algebra to be an étale&#10;algebra. Let us recall the following definition from the theory of group&#10;schemes (see for example or )&#10;&#10;Let be a group scheme of finite type over Let be the underlying Hopf&#10;algebra of and consider the largest étale k-subalgebra of then has a&#10;Hopf algebra structure induced from the one on and we let be the group&#10;scheme associated to this Hopf algebra.&#10;&#10;Note that there is a canonical map It is easy to see that if then is&#10;geometrically connected since in that case has no nontrivial&#10;idempotents.&#10;&#10;Any -algebra scheme of finite type over any infinite field is&#10;geometrically connected.&#10;&#10;Consider the connected-étale exact sequence of group schemes where is&#10;the identity component of We will first show that has a natural -algebra&#10;scheme structure. Indeed, for this it is enough to show that is a -ideal&#10;scheme in . Let us start by proving that We know that the multiplication&#10;takes the additive identity to itself, i.e for any Further, the -algebra&#10;structure on is induced from the -algebra structure on This clearly&#10;implies that is a -ideal scheme. Thus, the quotient is a -algebra&#10;scheme. Let us see that is isomorphic to One knows that the underlying&#10;algebra of is a product of finite separable -extensions. We consider&#10;this is a -algebra (since is a ring scheme). Because the underlying&#10;algebra of is a finite product of finite separable field extensions, is&#10;a finite set. However, for a finite set to have a -algebra structure it&#10;must just contain one element, i.e it has to be the zero ring. This&#10;implies that so is geometrically connected.&#10;&#10;Now, let us consider a Hopf algebra and denote the primitive elements of&#10;by We say that a Hopf algebra is primitively generated if generates as&#10;an algebra. Over characteristic zero all unipotent affine group schemes&#10;are primitively generated. We then have the classical Milnor-Moore&#10;theorem .&#10;&#10;For any commutative connected affine unipotent group scheme over a field&#10;of characteristic zero, the canonical map is an isomorphism of group&#10;schemes. In particular, the underlying scheme is affine space.&#10;&#10;Let us note that we can view as a Lie algebra with trivial commutator.&#10;Then the construction is the same as the universal enveloping Lie&#10;algebra of&#10;&#10;In it is shown that if is a plethory over a field , then the primitives&#10;with respect to is a cocommutative -bialgebra. Briefly, the&#10;multiplication in is given by the plethysm and the maps induces a&#10;comultiplication respectively a counit on making it a cocommutative&#10;counital bialgebra.&#10;&#10;Let be a plethory over a field of characteristic zero . Then is linear,&#10;i.e where has the plethory structure as given in Definition 3.1.&#10;&#10;Suppose that is a plethory over . naturally has a bialgebra structure as&#10;explained above. Given this, we can form the free plethory on We always&#10;have a natural map of Hopf algebras, and this is bijective by&#10;Milnor-Moore. Thus to show that any plethory is linear, it suffices to&#10;show that this is actually a morphism of plethories. But this is clear:&#10;the pair and is initial in the category of pairs consisting of a&#10;plethory and a morphism of bialgebras. It is immediate that the&#10;canonical map is induced by this universal property, when we note that&#10;there clearly is a map of bialgebras. We will of course need to show&#10;that is an isomorphism in the category of plethories. This follows&#10;easily from the fact that is an isomorphism of affine schemes and thus&#10;has an inverse in the category of affine schemes. What remains to be&#10;checked is that this inverse is a morphism of plethories, but this is&#10;immediate since is.&#10;&#10;Let be a field of characteristic zero. Then the category of plethories&#10;over is equivalent to the category of cocommutative -bialgebras.&#10;&#10;By the above theorem, the counit map is an isomorphism and it is&#10;immediate to see that the unit map is an isomorphism as well.&#10;&#10;If is a field of characteristic zero and a plethory over this shows that&#10;the category of -rings is equivalent to the category of rings with an&#10;action of the bialgebra">

<outline text="Some classification results in characteristic" _note="In this section we will start a classification for plethories over a&#10;perfect field of characteristic Our classification results here only&#10;apply to a certain class of plethories. We state future research&#10;directions, as well as give some ”pathological” examples which a&#10;complete classification must take into account. For any scheme over with&#10;structure map we let be the pullback of along the Frobenius.\&#10;\&#10;Let us briefly recall that for perfect fields group schemes over have&#10;two especially important maps, the (relative) Frobenius and the&#10;Verschiebung These satisfy the property that A ring scheme is called&#10;elementary unipotent if i.e the Verschiebung is zero. Call a plethory&#10;weakly linear if there is a map of plethories where is a linear plethory&#10;(as defined in the previous section) such that when viewed as a map of&#10;algebras is surjective. This will, in particular, imply that is&#10;primitively generated and is a quotient of by a -ideal as defined in .&#10;Not all plethories over a perfect field are primitively generated, as&#10;the following example shows (built on an example from , Remark 1.6.2).&#10;&#10;Let be the group scheme which as a scheme, is just We let the the group&#10;structure be given by for where This is a -torsion group scheme but is&#10;not elementary unipotent. One can define a non-unital ring scheme&#10;structure on be definining the multiplication to be trivial and then,&#10;when is finte, i.e ”unitalize” this by taking the direct product with to&#10;get a ring scheme, as we did in Example 3.3. The underlying group scheme&#10;of this ring scheme is clearly not elementary unipotent, since the&#10;Verschiebung acts on each factor separately. Taking the free plethory on&#10;a biring (see 2.1 ) will then give us a plethory with its underlying&#10;group scheme not elementary unipotent.&#10;&#10;Another feature which differs from the case over a field of&#10;characteristic zero is that there are plethories which have a&#10;non-trivial multiplicative subgroups. This stems from the fact that&#10;there are ring schemes with non-trivial multiplicative subgroups.&#10;&#10;Consider with comultiplication and counit This is an example of a&#10;multiplicative group scheme which is p-torsion and we can as before&#10;define a trivial multiplication on making it a non-unital ring scheme.&#10;We can then as previously stated, for finite fields, unitalize it to get&#10;a ring scheme by taking the direct product with and after that we can&#10;form the free plethory to get a plethory with a non-trivial&#10;multiplicative subgroup.The fact that it has a non-trivial&#10;multiplicative subgroup comes from , for example, the fact that there is&#10;a non-zero homomorphism of group schemes&#10;&#10;These two examples are rather artificial, but they show that plethories&#10;behave wildly different in characteristic than in characteristic We know&#10;that for any group scheme over a perfect field of characteristic the&#10;group of primitive elements has a natural action of the Frobenius,&#10;taking to In fact, becomes a module over a certain ring. As we&#10;previously stated, We thus have that is naturally a module over the&#10;endomorphism ring&#10;&#10;Let be the non-commutative polynomial ring over in one variable with&#10;multplication given by, for where is the Frobenius endomorphism of&#10;&#10;It is a quick calculation to show that We now see that is a module over&#10;Let us denote the category of modules over by Given a -module one can&#10;construct an elementary unipotent group scheme as follows (for details&#10;we refer the reader to ) . Form the symmetric algebra on with its&#10;obvious Hopf algebra structure and consider the map We then quotient out&#10;by the ideal generated by the elements to get One notes that for any&#10;commutative algebraic group one always has a map We have the following&#10;classical theorem (see )&#10;&#10;Let be an affine group scheme. The following are equivalent:\&#10;(i) The Verschiebung is zero.\&#10;(ii) is a closed subgroup of for some \&#10;(iii) The canonical homomorphism is an isomorphism.&#10;&#10;What we call is the same as the enveloping -algebra (also called the&#10;restricted universal enveloping algebra) on the -Lie algebra where has&#10;trivial commutator.&#10;&#10;When is a plethory, then has the structure of a plethory.&#10;&#10;We know that has a module structure where the action of is just taking&#10;the th power. Further, is the quotient of which we know is a plethory,&#10;by the ideal generated by , where is the inclusion in degree It now&#10;suffices to show that this is a -ideal (see 6.1) for to be a plethory.&#10;This is equivalent to showing that for a generating set of that and and&#10;that The first is immediate, since taking to be the set of all we have&#10;which is equal to Further, and this is equal to but this is in We also&#10;need to show that this is clear. The last containment is similarily easy&#10;to verify.&#10;&#10;When is a plethory over a perfect field such that then We then say that&#10;is a -linear plethory.&#10;&#10;All one has to verify is that the canonical map is a map of plethories.&#10;But this is obvious since this map is just the composition of the two&#10;plethory maps and&#10;&#10;We have seen that plethories need not be elementary unipotent and not&#10;purely unipotent either (i.e it can have a non-trivial multiplicative&#10;subgroup) Let us note that there can be no non-trivial finite plethories&#10;over an infinite perfect field Indeed, from what we have seen all&#10;plethories are connected over an infinite field. By classical Dieudonné&#10;theory we can then decompose as This would imply that the Frobenius is&#10;nilpotent, but this can never happen: the Frobenius is always a map of&#10;ring schemes.&#10;&#10;It seems to us that to classify plethories over a perfect field one&#10;should establish an extension of ordinary Dieudonné theory to account&#10;for ring schemes, which has been done to some extent by Hedayatzadeh in&#10;and for Hopf rings by Goerss and Buchstaber-Lazarev . Note that&#10;Hedayatzadeh work with finite / profinite group schemes and with local&#10;group schemes, which limits their applications to ring schemes since we&#10;have seen that there are no non-trivial finite connected ring schemes&#10;over a perfect field.">
