<outline text="Introduction" _note="The evolution of molecular clouds is controlled by a complex interplay&#10;of large-scale phenomena and microphysics: chemistry and interaction of&#10;the matter with the surrounding far-UV and cosmic-ray radiation control&#10;the thermodynamic state of the gas and its coupling to the magnetic&#10;field. The medium is highly turbulent, with Reynolds numbers reaching&#10;and magnetic Reynolds numbers reaching . Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)&#10;turbulence is one of the main counter-actions to gravity , as well as&#10;the major mechanism that shapes the clouds: their fractal geometry is&#10;related to the properties of their turbulent velocity field . The&#10;dissipation time scale for the turbulent energy of a molecular cloud is&#10;shorter than the age of such clouds . Hence, a continuous energy&#10;injection must exist . The proposed injection mechanisms may be either&#10;external, for instance Galactic shear or nearby supernovae explosions ,&#10;or internal, like the expansion of [&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} regions and molecular&#10;outflows of the recently formed stars . The nature of turbulence, and&#10;notably its solenoidal or compressive forcing, also plays a key role in&#10;the star formation efficiency (hereafter, SFE) of molecular clouds . In&#10;particular, compressive motions bear the mark of various phenomena&#10;related more or less directly to the formation of stars: infall on&#10;filaments, collapsing dense cores, expansion around young stars... As a&#10;result, we can expect that a more “compressive” cloud is a more “active”&#10;cloud, probably more likely to be forming stars, as proposed by .\&#10;In this work, we propose to measure for the first time (to our&#10;knowledge) the relative fractions of momentum in the solenoidal and&#10;compressible modes of turbulence in a molecular cloud, following a&#10;method devised and tested on numerical simulations by and . Our goal is&#10;to obtain a quantitative estimation of these fractions from&#10;observational data, and to compare their ratio with the star formation&#10;efficiency, derived from independent data. We investigate whether&#10;different fractions of compressive and solenoidal motions might provide&#10;a diagnostic for the variation of the star formation efficiency among&#10;molecular clouds. A different proportion of compressive forcing might be&#10;the reason why some molecular clouds form stars at a high rate while&#10;others do not .&#10;&#10;Our object of study is a large region of a nearby giant molecular cloud,&#10;namely the south-western edge of the OrionB cloud (Barnard33 or&#10;Lynds1630). OrionB is relatively close to us, at a typical distance of ,&#10;so that a spatial resolution of corresponds to 0.05pc or AU in the&#10;cloud. The total mass of OrionB is estimated to be , and the average&#10;incident FUV radiation field is . OrionB is located in the Orion GMC&#10;complex , east of the famous OrionBelt. Alnitak, the eastmost of the&#10;three belt stars shines in the foreground of the cloud. The&#10;south-western edge of the cloud represents an ideal laboratory to study&#10;star formation, and features several remarkable regions. First, the&#10;cloud is illuminated by the massive star Ori that creates an [&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} region, the emission&#10;nebula IC434, bounded on its eastern side by an ionization front.&#10;Silhouetted against this bright background, a dark cloud can be seen:&#10;the famous Horsehead nebula. HD38087 also creates a small &lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt; region, IC435. Still&#10;embedded in OrionB, the star-forming region NGC2024, known as the Flame&#10;Nebula, hosts several massive O-type young stellar objects, which have&#10;created compact [&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{}&#10;regions inside the cloud. NGC2024 lies just east of the Alnitak star,&#10;and is crossed by a filament which is seen in absorption in visible&#10;light, and in emission in the radio range. The reflection nebula NGC2023&#10;is a quieter counterpart of NGC2024, hosting young B-type stars. It lies&#10;North-East of the Horsehead nebula. The rest of the cloud contains&#10;extended and quieter areas with strong filamentary structures&#10;(Fig. \[fig:cloud\]). This area has been extensively observed in the 3mm&#10;range with the IRAM-30m telescope (PI: J. Pety). This survey has led to&#10;a series of papers (; ; ) to which this article belongs.\&#10;The paper is organised as follows. We briefly describe in Section 2 the&#10;observations by the ORION-B (Oustanding Radio Imaging of OrioN B)&#10;collaboration, and the data we use here. In Section 3, we present the&#10;concepts and equations of the statistical method and the details of its&#10;implementation, from noise filtering to the computation of power spectra&#10;and the estimation of velocity-density correlations. The results are&#10;described in Section 4, and discussed in Section 5 with a special&#10;emphasis on the relation of the turbulence properties with the star&#10;formation efficiency in OrionB. In the Appendix, we present our&#10;computation of the Mach number map in the cloud.">

  <outline text="The OrionB project dataset" _note="The OrionB project (PI: J. Pety) has already mapped with the IRAM-30m&#10;telescope the south-western edge of the OrionB molecular cloud over a&#10;field of view of 1.5 square degrees in the full frequency range from 84&#10;to 116[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} at 200[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} spectral resolution . The&#10;red rectangle in Fig. \[fig:cloud\] shows the field of view observed up&#10;to now, over an H column density map produced by the HERSCHEL Gould Belt&#10;Survey consortium . The mapped area covers arcminutes (about parsecs at&#10;the assumed distance of OrionB, 400[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}) in size.&#10;&#10;So far, the observations provided about 250000 spectra over a&#10;32[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} bandwidth, yielding a position-position-frequency&#10;cube of pixels, each pixel covering [[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} (at Nyquist&#10;sampling). The reduced dataset amounts to 100 GB of data. The data&#10;reduction is described in details in .&#10;&#10;This dataset is unique for its extensive coverage, both spatially and&#10;spectrally, at a typical resolution of and a median noise of&#10;0.1[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} per channel over a 32[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} spectral&#10;range. From the spatial point of view, the survey gives us access to a&#10;large range of scales in the molecular cloud, from 50[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} to&#10;10[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}. For the analysis of turbulence properties (see&#10;Sect. \[sec:turb\]), it means that we are able to study a large fraction&#10;of the inertial range of the turbulence, with a potential view on the&#10;injection scale. The dissipation scale, on the other hand, is of the&#10;order of a milli-parsec , and, at a distance of 400[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}, is&#10;only accessible using millimetre interferometers, and out of reach for&#10;the IRAM-30m telescope.&#10;&#10;From the spectral point of view, having such a large bandwidth observed&#10;in one go allowed us to image over 20 chemical species , among which&#10;those listed in Tab. \[tab:molecules\]. As opposed to several&#10;small-bandwidth mappings, the spectral lines in this survey are observed&#10;in the same conditions and are well inter-calibrated, which gives an&#10;unprecedented spectral accuracy for such a large field of view.">

  <outline text="The CO spectral data cube" _note="Most of the work presented here was performed on the CO() datacube,&#10;which covers a velocity range of 40[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} centred around the&#10;source systemic velocity of 10.5[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} and a rest frequency of&#10;. The datacube presents an RMS noise of , and a median signal-to-noise&#10;ratio of .&#10;&#10;The CO() line was chosen because it offers one of the highest&#10;signal-to-noise ratios over the whole map, but it does not feature as&#10;much saturation as the CO() line. Signal is present at a signal-to-noise&#10;ratio greater than 5 in the whole map, except in the &lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt; regions around Ori and&#10;HD38087 where molecular gas is photodissociated. The brightest regions&#10;are the NGC2023 nebula, the center of the NGC2024 nebula, and its&#10;northern edge (Fig. \[fig:moments\], left panel).&#10;&#10;CO is a good tracer of molecular gas, from moderately diffuse and&#10;translucent regions () up to moderately dense and shielded gas (, ). CO&#10;has a small dipole moment (0.11D), hence the rotational lines have low&#10;Einstein coefficients . This leads to relatively easy collisional&#10;excitation, excitation temperatures approaching the kinetic temperature,&#10;and moderate line opacities except for the most abundant species, CO.&#10;The abundance ratio CO/CO is equal to C/C or about 1/60 when chemical&#10;fractionation reactions, which are limited to the most diffuse regions,&#10;are inefficient . Therefore, the CO abundance relative to H remains&#10;approximately constant at a level of across most of the cloud volume. CO&#10;starts to be depleted on dust grains in cold cores, but these represent&#10;only a small fraction of the mass and a negligible fraction of the&#10;volume of the OrionB molecular cloud .&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig:channelmaps\] shows the CO() signal integrated over 4&#10;contiguous velocity ranges. It showcases the complexity of the spectral&#10;structure of the cloud, with prominent variations of the line profile&#10;with the position, which is a consequence of the strong turbulence at&#10;play in the molecular cloud.&#10;&#10;Up to four spectral components appear along each line-of-sight within&#10;the field (Fig. \[fig:spectra\]). A main component is visible around&#10;10[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}, and a secondary component at lower velocity (about&#10;5[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}). Sometimes an extra component at higher velocity&#10;(about 14[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}), or secondary peaks around 5 and&#10;10[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}appear too. The first two components are the most&#10;significant ones at the scale of the whole cloud, being the only ones&#10;visible in the mean spectrum of CO(), and have average velocities of&#10;9.7[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} and 4.9[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} respectively. All the&#10;components, despite being quite distinct on the spectral axis, are&#10;however thought to be part of the OrionB cloud .&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Deriving the relative fraction of solenoidal motions from a position-position-velocity cube" _note="In order to measure the fraction of the solenoidal and compressive&#10;turbulence modes, we apply the method developed by and . In this&#10;section, we first recall the method, its assumptions, and the way we&#10;implemented it.">
  <outline text="Description of the method">
    <outline text="Principles and assumptions" _note="The key point of this method is the fact that the objects we observe are&#10;fundamentally 3-dimensional ([[E.G.,]{}]{} a molecular cloud), but the&#10;observer only has access to a 2-dimensional projection along the line of&#10;sight of that object. developed a method to retrieve properties of the&#10;3-dimensional object that we are interested in, and which corresponds to&#10;a 3-dimensional field , via the properties of the 2-dimensional&#10;observational , which is a projection of along the axis. To achieve&#10;this, they use the fact that the Fourier transform of the 2-dimensional&#10;field is proportional to the cut through the Fourier transform of the&#10;3-dimensional field. In short, . If these fields are isotropic,&#10;[[I.E.,]{}]{} if they are functions of alone, with the wave vector and&#10;the wave number, the 2-dimensional field allows us to reconstruct&#10;average properties of the 3-dimensional field thanks to symmetry&#10;arguments.&#10;&#10;The method was developed as an application of the method to the case of&#10;vector fields. For a vector field such as a velocity or momentum field,&#10;the dimensionality reduction due to the projection is made worse by the&#10;fact that only one component of the vector (the line-of-sight one) can&#10;be measured, thanks to the Doppler effect. In that case, the next main&#10;tool to retrieve 3-dimensional properties is the Helmholtz theorem,&#10;which allows to decompose any vector field in its divergence-free&#10;(solenoidal) and curl-free (compressive) components, and . These&#10;components are related via a LOCAL orthogonality in Fourier space, .&#10;Solenoidal modes can be pictured as the modes of a turbulent&#10;incompressible field, made of vertices and eddies. On the other hand,&#10;compressive modes, made of compression and expansion motions, are more&#10;likely to be generated by phenomena linked to star formation.&#10;&#10;The application of these methods implies several requirements on the&#10;studied dataset. As mentioned earlier, the statistical isotropy of the&#10;cloud is the first necessary point, and enables the use of 2-dimensional&#10;averages as a means to estimate 3-dimensional properties. It means that&#10;the method cannot be applied to individual filaments, or to clouds where&#10;a strong anisotropy is suspected, [[E.G.,]{}]{} due to the presence of a&#10;strong magnetic field at low Mach numbers.&#10;&#10;Second, the field is required to go smoothly to zero on its borders.&#10;This property is needed to ensure that the decomposition of the field is&#10;unique, since the Helmholtz decomposition is, in theory, defined up to a&#10;vector constant. It is also a necessary condition for good behaviours of&#10;the Fourier transform, since actual observational data are not periodic&#10;fields, unlike hydro-dynamical simulations . This implies that the&#10;studied field should be bounded in space, like for example a&#10;gravitationally bound cloud. In the case where the signal extends up to&#10;the edge of the observed field, the dataset has to be apodized.&#10;&#10;Finally, from a practical viewpoint, have shown that their method works&#10;best for fields with power spectra that are not too steep. Steep power&#10;spectra give measurements that are very sensitive to the low spatial&#10;frequencies, which are usually uncertain due to poor statistics.&#10;&#10;The compliance of our dataset with these requirements is discussed in&#10;detail in Sect. \[sec:compliance\].">

    <outline text="Equations and notations" _note="The studied quantity is the momentum density field (hereafter&#10;“momentum”), , with and the volume density and the velocity.&#10;&#10;The 3-dimensional quantity we infer is the ratio of the variance of the&#10;transverse (solenoidal) momentum to the variance of the total momentum.&#10;For short, will be referred to as the “solenoidal fraction” in the rest&#10;of this paper.&#10;&#10;According to , at hypersonic Mach numbers () the solenoidal fraction&#10;does not depend any more on the type of forcing, but instead converges&#10;towards . note that this behaviour is different from what is observed by&#10;, where the solenoidal fraction converges to different values depending&#10;on the type of forcing, but this is due to the fact that consider the&#10;MOMENTUM density field, while describe the ENERGY density field.&#10;&#10;This value of can be simply explained in terms of equipartition of&#10;momentum between the compressive and solenoidal modes . A value of lower&#10;than 2/3 therefore means that there is more momentum in the compressive&#10;modes of the flow, and that the cloud is thus more likely to form stars.&#10;The influence of the Mach number is further discussed in&#10;Sect. \[sec:mach\].&#10;&#10;The available observables are a position-position-velocity cube, its&#10;velocity-weighted moments and the power spectra of these moments. We&#10;make two major assumptions about this datacube, namely that the CO()&#10;line is optically thin and that its emissivity only depends on the CO&#10;volume density. These assumptions are true within less than 20%, with&#10;the exception of a few lines of sight towards the center of NGC2024,&#10;which are more saturated, but represent about 2% of the whole field.&#10;Under these assumptions, the position-position-velocity cube can be seen&#10;as a density-weighted velocity field: the spectrum obtained for each&#10;line of sight results from the projection of the emission of the matter&#10;present along this line of sight, and moving at various velocities.&#10;&#10;The useful moments are the zero-th, first and second order moments of&#10;the momentum field, , and , which are defined as follows in :&#10;&#10;The spectral line intensity, , may have contributions from various&#10;positions along the line of sight. Given our assumptions on emissivity,&#10;and assuming that the natural linewidth is negligible compared to the&#10;overall velocity dispersion, we can describe these moments in an&#10;alternative way: The solenoidal fraction can be written in terms of&#10;these observational quantities as follows (see for details): The and&#10;factors are functions of the power spectra of and . where and are the&#10;angular averages of the power spectra and , respectively.&#10;&#10; introduce a statistical correction factor, , of order unity, which&#10;measures the correlations between the variations of the density and the&#10;velocity fields, and is defined as show that this may be written as The&#10;3-dimensional variance of the volume density, , can be derived using the&#10;method. The exponent is a small, positive constant, which can be&#10;obtained as the exponent of the vs. power law, [[I.E.,]{}]{} the typical&#10;velocity dispersion in the cloud as a function of volume density. If the&#10;density and velocity fields were uncorrelated, would be equal to 1.">

  <outline text="Implementation" _note="Actual data suffer from several limitations that need to be dealt with&#10;in order to apply the method described previously. The field of view,&#10;the angular resolution, and the sensitivity are limited. This section&#10;describes how these issues were dealt with.">
    <outline text="Noise filtering" _note="Computation of line moments is sensitive to noise in the line wings. It&#10;is well-known that masking the position-position-velocity cube where&#10;signal stays undetected improves the determination of the centroid&#10;velocity and linewidth. To define the mask containing the pixels&#10;detected at high significance, these pixels are first grouped into&#10;continuous brightness islands that are made of neighbouring pixels in&#10;the position-position-velocity space, whose signal-to-noise ratio is&#10;larger than 2. The noise level, , is measured outside the studied&#10;velocity range . The list of islands is then sorted by decreasing total&#10;flux. The first island contains about 97.8 % of the total signal. The&#10;following ones are small signal clumps that are spatially or spectrally&#10;isolated from this main block, and after about a few hundred islands we&#10;are left with single-cell islands which are just noise peaks.&#10;&#10;While it is easy to visually assess that the first few islands&#10;correspond to genuine signal, it is more complex to determine the&#10;transition to pure noise, as a significant fraction of the total line&#10;flux could be hidden in pixels of faint brightness, at low&#10;signal-to-noise ratio. We thus studied the influence of the number of&#10;islands used on , the solenoidal fraction in the studied cube. This&#10;influence is modest, mainly because over 97% of the signal is located in&#10;the first island. Using up to about 80 islands yields a very stable&#10;value of with less than 0.1% variation. A steep increase of is observed&#10;when we enter the noisy domain. We thus used the 80 brightest islands&#10;for all other calculations.">

    <outline text="Moment computation" _note="After selecting the signal islands in the position-position-velocity&#10;cube, the moments are integrated from to 20.5[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}. The&#10;calculations have to be performed in the center-of-mass frame of&#10;reference of the cloud, which implies determining the centroid velocity&#10;of the cloud in the LSR frame. This center-of-mass velocity is simply&#10;given by where is the first moment field in the observer’s frame of&#10;reference. , on the other hand, is not velocity-weighted, and therefore&#10;does not depend on the frame of reference.

    <outline text="Apodization" _note="Computing the power spectra of the and fields requires to take the&#10;Fourier transform of these fields. Although calculating the FFT of&#10;2-dimensional fields is an easy task, several numerical artefacts must&#10;be taken care of. In particular, the observed area does not reach the&#10;edges of the OrionB molecular cloud in all directions as illustrated in&#10;Fig.\[fig:cloud\]. This sharp truncation of the CO emission will create&#10;artefacts in the Fourier transform, due to the convolution of the true&#10;Fourier spectrum by a sinus cardinal function that oscillates at high&#10;frequencies. Apodizing the field is required to avoid this behaviour. We&#10;have chosen to multiply the intensity by , where is the pixel coordinate&#10;and the apodization width. This function goes from 0 to 1 over pixels.&#10;This apodization function is used in . We keep the region affected by&#10;apodization as small as possible to minimize signal alteration. An&#10;apodization width of about 5 % of the smallest dimension of the field&#10;([[I.E.,]{}]{} roughly 25 pixels) was the smallest value that&#10;efficiently smoothed out the high-frequency artefacts. This is&#10;consistent as well with the width determined in .&#10;&#10;Once the field is apodized, it must be made square to follow the&#10;isotropy requirements of the method. The square was built by padding&#10;with zeros the right side (west) of the observed area, as this is the&#10;location of the [&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{}&#10;region associated with Ori, [[I.E.,]{}]{} no signal is detected past the&#10;western edge of the field of view. After this, the Fourier transform is&#10;calculated using the FFT implementation of Numpy 1.8 .&#10;&#10;Apodization is a linear filter of the data, and thus has effects on the&#10;power spectrum at all frequencies. While apodization allows us to&#10;“clean” the spectrum at high spatial frequencies, it also alters the&#10;spectrum at the lowest frequencies. For example, – the value of the&#10;power spectrum at spatial frequency – is directly proportional to the&#10;spatial integral of , therefore losing some signal due to the&#10;apodization will reduce the value of . The method chosen to keep the&#10;good parts of the apodized and non-apodized spectra was the following:&#10;we first computed the FFT of both the apodized and non-apodized fields,&#10;respectively and , then mixed them smoothly around using a narrow (about&#10;10 Fourier-space pixels) 2-dimensional Gaussian . The resulting Fourier&#10;field is The power spectrum thus behaves as the non-apodized spectrum at&#10;low , keeping the correct value of the field integral , and as the&#10;apodized spectrum at high , free of the spectral parasites created by&#10;the sharp edges of the map.">

    <outline text="Power spectra computation and fit" _note="The apodized and corrected FFT of the field needs to be transformed into&#10;an angle-averaged power spectrum or . It is simply done by binning the&#10;modulus of the spatial frequencies, and averaging the points found in&#10;these radial bins. The resulting discrete function can then be linearly&#10;interpolated into a continuous function. A critical element to this&#10;exercise resides in the sampling of the spatial frequency axis. On the&#10;one hand, the resulting angle-averaged spectrum should be as detailed as&#10;possible, but on the other hand, a larger number of bins can lead to&#10;empty bins, containing no sampled points at all. As a result, we used a&#10;number of bins of , with the size in pixels of the square field, so that&#10;the size of a bin in the Fourier space corresponds to slightly more than&#10;the length of the diagonal of pixels in the Fourier space.&#10;&#10;Additional observational constraints (noise, beam shape, etc.) affect&#10;the determination of the power spectrum. Following , the power spectra&#10;are fitted with a power law, modified to take into account the&#10;single-dish beam and the noise. In our case, the beam is modelled as the&#10;Fourier transform of a Gaussian of FWHM equal to the cube resolution,&#10;[[I.E.,]{}]{} . This corresponds to about 2.61 pixels. The convolution&#10;in the image space corresponds to a multiplication in the Fourier space&#10;that mostly affects the high spatial frequencies.&#10;&#10;The noise is not a Gaussian white noise, because of inter-pixel&#10;correlations and systematics. We therefore use the power spectra of 30&#10;signal-free channels and average them to obtain a template of the noise&#10;power spectrum. In this case, we use the fully noisy data cube, not the&#10;80 first signal islands, in order to have the same spatial correlations&#10;in noise for each channel (with or without signal), which would not be&#10;the case with a masked data cube. The noise template intends to&#10;reproduce a systematic behaviour, but we can only use a finite number of&#10;channels with random noise. The noise template is therefore smoothed to&#10;make this systematic pattern stand out more. Given that is, just like ,&#10;a linear combination of the channel maps, the same noise template is&#10;used for both power spectra.&#10;&#10;The fit is performed in the log()-log() space, so that the straight line&#10;of the power law stands out more. The fitting function is therefore the&#10;logarithm of where is the Gaussian beam, is its (Gaussian) Fourier&#10;transform, and is our noise template. The fitted parameters are , and .&#10;During the fit, the data are weighted by the inverse of the variances&#10;obtained in each bin when computing the power spectrum.&#10;&#10;The choice of fitting the power spectrum with a modified power law&#10;implies that the underlying physical processes should produce a power&#10;law. This is indeed the case for the inertial range of scales in&#10;Kolmogorov turbulence, and can be applied as well to Burgers turbulence&#10;. However, the power spectrum of turbulence starts to deviate from a&#10;power law at scales where the energy is injected (low spatial&#10;frequencies) or dissipated (high spatial frequencies). The power spectra&#10;computed from our dataset somewhat deviates from a power law at low&#10;spatial frequencies (see Fig. \[fig:W0\]). The power law can therefore&#10;only be fitted and then used above a given spatial frequency. The&#10;power-law range starts around . At high spatial frequencies, no&#10;deviations from the power law are detected (the fits render the&#10;observations very well). This means that either the dissipation scale&#10;happens at lower angular scale than the resolution of the observations&#10;or it is hidden in the noise.\&#10;Once the fit has been performed, the final version of the power spectra&#10;is built using both the fit result and the observational angle-averaged&#10;power spectra, and used for further calculations. The final power&#10;spectrum is a pure power law (without the beam and noise) above the&#10;arcmin threshold, and is equal to the linearly interpolated&#10;angle-averaged power spectrum below this threshold. In particular, we&#10;enforce , since we are working in the cloud’s rest frame.">

  <outline text="Density-velocity correlations" _note="We used the information on the mean line profiles to estimate the slope&#10;of the relation between the velocity dispersion and the local density&#10;(see Eq. \[eq:g21\]). Among the lines detected in the mean spectrum, we&#10;have selected lines with different spatial distributions . To trace the&#10;low density gas, we have selected CO() and HCO() as these lines present&#10;very extended emission and have moderate excitation requirements . We&#10;have included CO() as our tracer of the bulk of the gas. The somewhat&#10;denser and more shielded gas is well traced by CO(), while we have&#10;selected NH() for the dense cores. For these five species, we determined&#10;the FWHM by fitting a Gaussian line profile to the mean profile of the&#10;whole map. Only the 10[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} component, which is present for&#10;all five species, was used for this fit. For NH we used the HFS fit&#10;method in GILDAS/CLASS[^1], which makes use of the information on the&#10;hyperfine structure.&#10;&#10;While these lines are emitted by gas over a wide range of densities,&#10;there is a minimum density under which the line is not detected, because&#10;of lack of excitation or because the molecule is not present in low&#10;density gas. It is this minimum density which corresponds to velocity&#10;dispersion of the line. To derive the densities associated with the line&#10;emission, we adopted three different methods.&#10;&#10;For the low density and extended emission tracers, we derived the volume&#10;density by comparing the minimum gas column density where the emission&#10;is detected and the resulting size of the emission regions. This leads&#10;to gas densities of a few hundred cm for CO(), HCO() and CO(). The&#10;emission of CO() is dominated by the low density regions . The emission&#10;of HCO() is also dominated by low to intermediate density regions, and&#10;comes from the weak excitation regime . In both cases, opacity&#10;broadening is not very significant. We must however consider that the&#10;line widths for these tracers are upper bounds, due to this effect of&#10;opacity broadening. For these molecules, we are also limited by the&#10;sensitivity of the observations, so that the densities should be&#10;regarded as upper limits. analysed the structure and kinematics of the&#10;Horsehead nebula and derived the density of the extended region traced&#10;by CO as  cm. We have kept this value as the typical density traced by&#10;CO. have shown that higher density regions exist with densities&#10;significantly larger than 10 cm. As very few pixels are detected in NH&#10;in the region of the Horsehead nebula, we have used the catalogue of&#10;dense cores identified by in their SCUBA2 map of the OrionB complex. We&#10;have found 55 cores associated with NH() emission. The densities have&#10;been derived using the extracted fluxes and effective radii, a uniform&#10;dust temperature of 20[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}, and assuming spherical geometry&#10;for all cores. The mean density is 10 cm with a scatter of about a&#10;factor of two. The temperature of the NH cores was not individually&#10;checked, but it is likely to be lower than 20[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}. In turn,&#10;this implies an even higher density of NH. Therefore, the derived&#10;density should be regarded as a lower limit.&#10;&#10;Table \[tab:molecules\] presents the resulting data, which are&#10;illustrated in Fig. \[fig:g21\]. The slope is derived from a least&#10;square fit of the variation of the FWHM with the density. We derive .&#10;The possible systematics on the densities traced by CO(), HCO() and&#10;NH(), as well as on the linewidths of CO() and HCO(), all tend to make&#10;the power law steeper. Therefore, we keep this value of as an upper&#10;limit.&#10;&#10;\[tab:molecules\]&#10;&#10;[^1]: See `http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/` for more details on the&#10;    GILDAS software.">

In our case, the different variables&#10;are strongly correlated, since they are all by-products of the same data&#10;cube. Therefore, we chose to use the average of the various relative&#10;errors as a rule-of-thumb estimate of the overall error. This approach&#10;yielded an overall relative error of 13% for the whole field, and 8% for&#10;the deepest zooms. We kept the highest value to allow for a safety&#10;margin.&#10;&#10;This 13% relative error corresponds to the median noise-to-signal ratio&#10;in the field, , which is also of the order of 13% – but testing with&#10;simulated noise whether this is a coincidence or not is out of the scope&#10;of this article.">

  <outline text="Turbulence mode ratio" _note="We have determined a relative error of about 13% on the calculation of&#10;the ratio from the position-position-velocity cube. The correction&#10;factor is determined independently, and we assume a range of possible&#10;values for , the lower limit being given by our calculations of&#10;Sect. \[sec:g21\], and the upper limit resulting from the minimum&#10;estimate of according to .&#10;&#10;For the entire CO field, we obtain the following range of values:&#10;&#10;In order to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics at stake in the&#10;OrionB cloud, the method was also applied to several sub-regions of the&#10;CO map.&#10;&#10;First, to check the reliability of the method and the homogeneity of the&#10;field, we applied a sliding square window, whose side is equal to the&#10;smallest dimension of the mapped area (Fig. \[fig:slide\]). This avoids&#10;zero-padding the studied field. The results show that even though the&#10;values are in general somewhat lower for these sub-fields than for the&#10;whole CO field, they remain marginally compatible with this result,&#10;within the estimated uncertainties.&#10;&#10;Second, we searched for systematic variations of the fraction of&#10;solenoidal modes when zooming into specific regions of the map. In&#10;particular, signs of the solenoidal or compressive forcing are expected&#10;to appear mainly in regions of low Mach numbers (see&#10;Sect. \[sec:mach\]). The zooms were thus performed into the NGC2023 and&#10;NGC2024 star-forming regions (Fig. \[fig:zoom\]) where the Mach number&#10;lies between about 3 and 5 (see Fig. \[fig:mach:ima\]), mostly because&#10;the speed of sound is higher in regions of higher gas temperature, but&#10;also because the velocity dispersion is a bit lower.&#10;&#10;Moreover, these regions offer the advantage of presenting a strongly&#10;localized emission. One of the requirements of the Brunt &amp; Federrath&#10;method is to use isolated fields. This is clearly not the case any more&#10;when zooming into these specific regions, and apodization is more&#10;necessary than ever to ensure that the signal falls smoothly to zero on&#10;the edges of the field. However, by using fields for which most of the&#10;signal is concentrated near the center, the effects of apodization are&#10;minimized, allowing us to stay as close as possible to the requirement&#10;of an isolated field. The smaller the field, the lower the value of :&#10;this indicates an increasing proportion of compressive forcing.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Discussion">
  <outline text="Compliance with the method’s assumptions" _note="In order to apply the Brunt &amp; Federrath method to real observational&#10;data, we were able to overcome several difficulties and sources of&#10;uncertainty.&#10;&#10;First, the compliance of the dataset with the requirements of the method&#10;must be checked, namely the isotropy of the studied cloud, and its&#10;isolation. The whole field and the zooms present two opposite&#10;situations. The isolation criterion is well met in the case of the whole&#10;field: we have almost no signal to the West and to the South of the&#10;field, and very diffuse regions to the North and to the East (see&#10;Fig. \[fig:moments\], first column), so that there is almost no need for&#10;apodization in order to have the signal going down to zero on the edges&#10;of the field. For the zooms, on the other hand, we are well into the&#10;cloud, so that there is signal all the way to the edges of the field.&#10;However, since we study local maxima of the emission, most of the signal&#10;is in the center, which minimizes the effects of the necessary&#10;apodization on the final results (only 7.9% of lost signal for the&#10;deepest NGC2023 zoom, 7.6% for NGC2024).&#10;&#10;As far as the isotropy criterion is concerned, the 2D projection is&#10;quite obviously isotropic in the case of the zooms, since the considered&#10;fields are square, and much less in the case of the whole field, in&#10;which the region with signal has an aspect ratio of about 2:1. The third&#10;dimension is unknown, and in any case cannot match simultaneously the&#10;dimensions of the whole field and those of the deepest zooms. However,&#10;for the large diffuse regions like for the bright, compact regions, the&#10;dimension along the line of sight is supposed to be of the order of the&#10;dimensions in the plane of the sky. In the case of a zoom on a bright&#10;region embedded in a diffuse one, the signal, and therefore the&#10;dimension on which it is emitted along the line of sight, is dominated&#10;by the bright gas. Therefore, since the zooms are centred on a bright&#10;region, the corresponding datacube behaves almost as if the bright&#10;region was isolated and isotropic. Besides, the non-angle-averaged power&#10;spectra of and do not show any apparent anisotropy at any scale (except&#10;for the windowing effects). If the power spectra are isotropic in two&#10;dimensions, then statistically we can expect the third dimension to&#10;follow this isotropy as well. Therefore, the isotropy requirement seems&#10;to be fulfilled by our dataset and the method can be applied.&#10;&#10;Second, as was mentioned by , the method is sensitive to values of the&#10;power spectra at large spatial scales (low frequencies of the power&#10;spectra) due to the characteristics of the sums in the parameters and .&#10;We therefore had to find a way to obtain a smooth and reliable function&#10;that would represent an angle-averaged power spectrum at all&#10;frequencies. Once the power spectra were binned and fitted, we have two&#10;versions of the spectra, each with its flaws. The binned (“data only”)&#10;spectrum suffers from observational effects (noise and beam) but has&#10;also larger uncertainties at low spatial frequencies. The fitted&#10;spectrum, if extrapolated to all spatial frequencies (“fit only”), can&#10;give unphysical results in the lowest frequencies because they lie&#10;outside the power law validity range. For example, if the field had been&#10;zero-padded all around to create a very large square, such an&#10;extrapolation would give very high values of the spectrum at low&#10;frequencies, whereas physically they should be very low, since the field&#10;would on average be almost empty. These flaws led us to choose the&#10;composite scheme described in Sect. \[sec:powerspectra\], where the fit&#10;result is used only in the “inertial domain”, and the low frequencies&#10;keep the angle-averaged power spectrum as it is. Using a different&#10;version of the power spectra leads to quite different final results, as&#10;illustrated in Fig. \[fig:compare\]. However, it is important to note&#10;that even though the absolute value of the solenoidal fraction varies,&#10;the relative variations are consistent across scales whatever the power&#10;spectra computing scheme. Thus, results such as the unusually high&#10;solenoidal fraction at the scale of the whole cloud, or the variations&#10;of when zooming out of the star-forming regions, stay valid, and are&#10;further discussed below.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Physical interpretation" _note="To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt at applying the Brunt &amp;&#10;Federrath method to actual observational data . The results need to be&#10;compared with what was done so far on numerical simulations.&#10;&#10;Both and our calculations (see Sect. \[sec:mach\] and Appendix) show&#10;that we are in a context of highly supersonic turbulence, with a mean&#10;Mach number of about 6. We therefore expect a full mixing of the&#10;turbulence modes, so that the energy equipartition would predict a&#10;solenoidal fraction of and a compressive fraction of . Deviations from&#10;this ratio can either be a sign of a specific forcing for the turbulence&#10;in the case of transonic Mach numbers, as shown in the case of&#10;simulations , or indicate that an ordered flow is superimposed on top of&#10;the turbulent flow.&#10;&#10;The global value of and the values on Fig. \[fig:slide\] can agree,&#10;within the error bars, with the expected value in case of equipartition.&#10;However, the value is still quite high. It can be the sign of a&#10;deviation in favour of solenoidal modes. At high Mach numbers, it would&#10;imply that an ordered solenoidal flow is superimposed on top of the&#10;turbulence. And Figure \[fig:moments\] (column 2) shows that there is a&#10;large-scale differential motion in the cloud with the southern part&#10;receding while the northern part is approaching. This velocity shift&#10;could be the sign of a large-scale rotation of the whole cloud, which&#10;could dominate the smaller-scale motions and be responsible for the&#10;large fraction of solenoidal modes.&#10;&#10;The fact that the turbulence in the OrionB molecular cloud is, on large&#10;scales, mostly solenoidal, is in agreement with the fact that, for its&#10;mass, OrionB has a low star-formation rate . Estimations of its SFE&#10;vary, with values ranging from 0.4% to 3% , but all studies show that&#10;the SFE in OrionB is about four times lower than in the neighbouring&#10;cloud Orion A. In general, OrionB’s SFE is regarded as particularly low,&#10;with stressing that is has the lowest SFE among all molecular clouds&#10;closer than 500[[[[]{}]{}]{}]{}. This remarkable feature of the OrionB&#10;cloud could be partially explained by the solenoidal flows that drive&#10;its velocity field, and hinder collapsing motions that could trigger&#10;star formation.\&#10;In contrast, Figure \[fig:zoom\] shows a major deviation from the&#10;equipartition in favour of compressive motions in two specific regions.&#10;When zooming deeply into the star-forming regions NGC2023 and NGC2024,&#10;we obtain solenoidal fractions as low as . The high fraction of&#10;compressive flow in these two regions most likely results from the&#10;infall of matter onto the star-forming region, and/or the expansion of&#10;the [&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} regions around&#10;the young massive stars . The [&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} regions themselves are&#10;not observed in molecular tracers, so that this expansion is detected&#10;indirectly through the compression of the molecular gas at the&#10;ionization front of the [&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} regions.&#10;&#10;For both regions, grows when zooming out, and will eventually reach the&#10;average values displayed on Fig. \[fig:slide\]. tends to decrease when&#10;reaching a field size of about . This behaviour can be due to the fact&#10;that the other star-forming region is entering the field of view, since&#10;the distance between the two cores is about , but it can also be related&#10;to the geometry of each region.&#10;&#10;In the case of NGC2023, this size of also corresponds to the PDR of the&#10;Horsehead Nebula coming into the field, and, due to the pressure at the&#10;photo-dissociation front, it is expected to be a compressive region ,&#10;which is proven by the detection of at least one young star and one&#10;protostar in this region .&#10;&#10;In the case of NGC2024, we see that starts increasing again after , even&#10;though NGC2023 comes more and more into the field. The variations of&#10;around might therefore be related to the location of the edge of the&#10;[&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} region around&#10;NGC2024. This [&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{}&#10;bubble exerts a pressure on the surrounding gas , and this edge is&#10;therefore a highly compressive region, which can be seen in the form of&#10;an arc north of NGC2024 . This region has a far lower surface density of&#10;stars that the inner part of NGC2024, but it is likely to be younger&#10;that NGC2024 (since it is a consequence of the expansion of the [&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Hii&lt;/span&gt;]{} region), and therefore&#10;might have formed only very young protostars, poorly detected by SPITZER&#10;, or no stars yet – but it might become a very active region in the&#10;future.\&#10;The sharp contrast between the large-scale solenoidal flow and the&#10;highly compressive flows in the NGC2023 and NGC2024 nebulae is in&#10;agreement with the spatial distribution of star formation observed in&#10;OrionB: observes that the large-scale SFE in the OrionB cloud is an&#10;order of magnitude lower than in the most massive cores, shows that, at&#10;his detection level, 100% of young stars in OrionB are located in&#10;clusters (NGC2068 in the North, and NGC2024 in the South), which is&#10;unusual among the studied clouds, and conclude that OrionB is very&#10;ineffective at forming stars at mag, as compared to other GMCs.&#10;&#10;In a broader perspective, not only do these variations of confirm&#10;observationally the intuitive link between compressive motions and star&#10;formation, as proposed in simulations , but they also show that there&#10;can be an intra-cloud variability of the solenoidal fraction, in&#10;addition to the inter-cloud one. This shows that the large-scale&#10;environment of the cloud, although it plays a major role in driving the&#10;turbulence of the molecular cloud, cannot explain all by itself the&#10;repartition of solenoidal and compressive motions in the cloud: any&#10;denser region created by the density fluctuation in the compressible&#10;turbulent gas can lead, under the effect of self-gravity or stellar&#10;feedback, to the formation of very localized, strongly compressive&#10;regions, even in the context of a mostly solenoidal flow. There is&#10;therefore no universal solenoidal fraction that can be applied generally&#10;to all clouds, and there are even intrinsic variations of from region to&#10;region within a cloud.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="From a practical point of view, our work has shown that it is possible&#10;to apply the numerical method of to observational data, in order to&#10;determine the fraction of solenoidal and compressive motions in a&#10;molecular cloud, using molecular lines as tracers of the density and&#10;velocity fields. We were able to pinpoint the observational requirements&#10;to apply this method to a dataset.&#10;&#10;The spatial dynamic range is an important element, mostly in order to&#10;provide good quality power spectra. The field must be large enough to&#10;provide good statistics at low spatial frequencies, but it must also&#10;have a good spatial resolution, so that the power spectra have enough&#10;points to correct properly for the beam and noise effects. We found our&#10;minimum field size to be of at least 50 independent pixels.&#10;&#10;In addition to the spatial resolution, having many independent spectral&#10;channels is of great help when correcting for the beam and noise&#10;effects. The spectral resolution must also be sufficient to resolve the&#10;studied spectral line.&#10;&#10;The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) also proved to be a key element during&#10;the calculations. An average SNR of at least 5 is desirable: our&#10;datacube, which has a mean SNR of 7.8, yielded a relative observational&#10;uncertainty of 13% on the fraction of momentum in the solenoidal modes,&#10;and Figures \[fig:slide\] and \[fig:zoom\] show that this observational&#10;uncertainty contributes significantly to the overall uncertainty, and is&#10;even dominant at low solenoidal fractions.&#10;&#10;The last point of the computation – the density-velocity correlation,&#10;which also significantly contributes to the overall uncertainty,&#10;requires to use many spectral tracers of various typical densities. In&#10;that case, a spectral survey such as the one of the OrionB project is&#10;invaluable, in so far as all the needed tracers are available and&#10;inter-calibrated.\&#10;From a physical point of view, the measurements have shown that the&#10;motions in the OrionB molecular cloud are highly supersonic, with a mean&#10;Mach number of . However, the Mach number maps show large variations,&#10;with some regions being only moderately supersonic. These variations are&#10;due both to the variations of the temperature and to the turbulent&#10;velocity distribution in the cloud.&#10;&#10;The largest scales of the cloud seem to be dominated by a rotational&#10;motion, which can be identified by a high solenoidal fraction in the&#10;flow. At smaller scales, we have shown that the motion is largely&#10;dominated by compressive (infall and / or outflow) motions in the&#10;vicinity of the NGC2023 and NGC2024 star-forming regions. The northern&#10;edge of NGC2024 and the photo-dissociation front of the Horsehead nebula&#10;are also likely to be highly compressive regions, according to our&#10;results. This is in agreement with the observations of the&#10;star-formation efficiency in OrionB, which is unusually low at the scale&#10;of the whole cloud, and exclusively concentrated in clusters (NGC2023&#10;and NGC2024).&#10;&#10;The example of OrionB also shows that the star formation efficiency in a&#10;molecular cloud does not only depend on its overall fraction of momentum&#10;in the solenoidal modes of turbulence, but also on the local variations&#10;of this fraction, which can be driven by internal phenomena such as&#10;self-gravity and stellar feedback.\&#10;This method could be applied in the future to study the variations of&#10;the solenoidal fraction between different molecular clouds, or between&#10;different regions or different chemical tracers within a given cloud. In&#10;the case of OrionB, we intend to analyse other data cubes for tracers&#10;such as CO or HCO, which trace respectively more compact and more&#10;diffuse regions of the cloud, in order to probe different environments&#10;in terms of density and temperature.&#10;&#10;We wish to thank Patrick Hennebelle, Edith Falgarone and Pierre Lesaffre&#10;for fruitful conversations on hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, as&#10;well as our referee for enlightening remarks on compressible turbulence&#10;in the interstellar medium.

The dust temperature is supposed to be a&#10;lower limit close to the kinetic temperature of the gas, except when it&#10;is not deemed reliable any more: above a threshold of 60K, we deem that&#10;HERSCHEL and PLANCK observations do not yield the best temperature&#10;estimate due to their limited wavelength ranges ( [[[[]{}]{}]{}]{} for&#10;HERSCHEL). At these temperatures, CO() is usually saturated enough to&#10;give a good result for the excitation temperature, as can be seen from&#10;the CO()/CO() line ratio which diverges significantly from the C/C&#10;abundance ratio . We can therefore construct a third temperature map&#10;using the dust temperature and the excitation temperature of CO(): we&#10;use the excitation temperature whenever it is above the 60K threshold,&#10;and in other regions, we use the maximum of the gas excitation&#10;temperature and the dust temperature (Fig. \[fig:soundspeed\], panels 1&#10;to 3).&#10;&#10;When computing the speed of sound from the temperature map, the nature&#10;of the gas comes into play. We considered a 75% – 25% mixture in mass of&#10;molecular hydrogen and helium, which yields a molecular mass of&#10;2.513kg.mol. Since we are not simply dealing with a mono-atomic or&#10;diatomic ideal gas, the adiabatic index of this mixture has to be&#10;determined. To compute , we used tabulated NIST values of the calorific&#10;capacities and of the two gases at an average temperature of 24 K. The&#10;resulting value, , is very close to the value 5/3 that would be expected&#10;for a mono-atomic ideal gas – which could be expected since at such low&#10;temperatures, the ro-vibrational modes of H are frozen.">

  <outline text="Flow velocity" _note="The turbulent velocity dispersion was computed using the velocity&#10;dispersion along each line of sight, which can be derived from the map.&#10;We determined the flow velocity dispersion as (Fig. \[fig:soundspeed\],&#10;last panel).&#10;&#10;This computation implies two assumptions. First, we assume that the&#10;natural and thermal widths of the lines are negligible, compared to the&#10;turbulent broadening. Second, we neglect the opacity broadening as well.&#10;While it is correct that thermal broadening has less that 1 % effect on&#10;the line width, the assumption for the opacity broadening is less&#10;obvious. We determined that the expected correction would be of the&#10;order of 10 % for the brightest lines of sight, reducing the width of&#10;the lines and therefore the Mach number. However, given that the&#10;correction would have been difficult to implement for non-Gaussian&#10;lines, as it is the case in our CO() field, and that the correction&#10;would be significant only for a small fraction of the lines of sight, we&#10;left the turbulent velocity field uncorrected.">

  <outline text="Results" _note="The ratio of the turbulent velocity to the sound speed gives us the Mach&#10;number along the axis. The total Mach number is , when the turbulence is&#10;isotropic. The Mach number is determined twice, using two maps: the&#10;excitation (gas) temperature, and the maximum of dust and excitation&#10;temperatures as described above. We then compare the results of the two&#10;computations (Fig. \[fig:mach:ima\] and \[fig:mach:hist\]).&#10;&#10;To estimate the typical Mach number at the scale of the whole cloud, we&#10;plot the histogram of the obtained maps (Fig. \[fig:mach:hist\]). The&#10;shapes of the histograms are very similar for and . Due to the shape of&#10;both distributions, with a large tail at high Mach number, the most&#10;probable value of the Mach number for both distributions (), is&#10;significantly smaller than the mean and the median values, as shown in&#10;Tab. \[tab:mach\].&#10;&#10;\[tab:mach\]">
