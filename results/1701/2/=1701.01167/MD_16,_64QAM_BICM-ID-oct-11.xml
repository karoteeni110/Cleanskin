    <title>Efficient Multi-Dimensional Mapping Using QAM Constellations for BICM-ID</title>
    <abstract>**Bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID)
offers very good error performance over additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) and fading channels if it uses a wisely designed signal mapping.
Further, error performance of BICM-ID can significantly be improved by
employing multi-dimensional (MD) modulation. However, suitable MD
mappings are obtained by computer search techniques except for MD
modulations that use smaller constellation e.g., binary phase shift
keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and -ary phase shift
keying (-PSK) as basic modulation. The alphabet size of MD modulations
increases exponentially as the order of the basic modulation increases
and computer search becomes intractable. In this paper, we propose a
systematic mapping method for MD modulations. The innovativeness of our
proposed method is that it generates MD mappings using - and -quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) very efficiently. The presented numerical
results show that the proposed method improves bit error rate (BER) of
BICM-ID.** </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In , Zehavi proposed bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) which was&#10;analytically investigated by G. Caire ET AL . BICM uses a&#10;bit-interleaver to separate the modulator from the encoder. Due to this&#10;separation, the modulator can be chosen independently from the encoder&#10;and it increases design flexibility . It also improves the time&#10;diversity order of coded modulation . Although random interleaving&#10;improves performance of BICM over fading channels, it reduces the&#10;minimum Euclidean distance between signals and degrades performance over&#10;additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels . To overcome this&#10;problem, iterative decoding was proposed for BICM receiver -. The&#10;resulted system is known as BICM with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) and&#10;achieves a significant coding gain through iterations. As such a good&#10;performance is obtained over both AWGN and fading channels . Symbol&#10;mapping is defined as labeling of constellation symbols with binary&#10;digits. It is well-known that the performance of BICM-ID depends on the&#10;applied symbol mapping and a number of works has been carried out to&#10;address this issue, see for examples, -. If a sequence of bits is mapped&#10;to a vector of symbols (symbol-vector) rather than a single symbol, the&#10;mapping is referred to as multi-dimensional (MD) mapping . For example,&#10;if symbols from phase shift keying (PSK) or quadrature amplitude&#10;modulation (QAM) are used in each symbol-vector, a -D modulation is&#10;obtained. In fact, error performance of BICM-ID can be significantly&#10;improved by employing MD modulation due to the increased Euclidean&#10;distance between symbol-vectors , .&#10;&#10;Although a higher order MD modulation offers more flexibility in&#10;generating good mappings for BICM-ID , it tremendously increases the&#10;number of possible mappings. In particular, -D modulations using -QAM&#10;symbols have possible mappings where denotes a factorial operation. So,&#10;it is difficult to find good/optimum mappings for MD modulations. This&#10;problem is more severe when MD modulations are constructed using higher&#10;order 2-D modulations. For example, the number of possible mappings for&#10;-D modulation using -QAM approaches infinity. Suitable MD mappings are&#10;obtained by computer search techniques except for MD modulations that&#10;use smaller constellation e.g., binary PSK (BPSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK)&#10;and -PSK as basic modulation. The so-called binary switch algorithm&#10;(BSA) is the best known computer search method for finding good&#10;mappings. However to obtain suitable mappings for larger modulations&#10;such as MD modulations, the BSA becomes intractable due to its&#10;complexity . In and , authors demonstrated that random mapping can lead&#10;to efficient MD mappings. According to the random mapping technique,&#10;computer search is used to obtain a good mapping from a large set of&#10;randomly generated mappings that makes the procedure complex. Moreover,&#10;it degrades the resulted mappings’ performance especially for larger MD&#10;modulations.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we propose an efficient mapping method for MD modulations&#10;that use -QAM () as basic modulation. Our goal is to obtain mappings&#10;which achieve a lower error rate for BICM-ID at low SNR values as well&#10;as at high SNR values. A similar objective is considered in where the&#10;authors used a doping technique (combining two mappings) to obtain&#10;mappings for -D modulations. However, instead of combining mappings, we&#10;develop a single mapping for a given MD modulation to achieve a lower&#10;error rate for BICM-ID at low SNR values as well as at high SNR values.&#10;Furthermore, our proposed method yields mappings for MD constellations&#10;rather than -D ones. The proposed method is a heuristic-based technique&#10;and does not employ any computer search. The presented numerical results&#10;show that our approach not only yields mapping efficiently but also&#10;improves bit error rate (BER) performance of BICM-ID over both AWGN and&#10;Rayleigh fading channels. For example, it can save about dB transmit&#10;signal energy for a target BER of compared to the mappings found by the&#10;BSA and random mappings.&#10;&#10;The rest of the paper is organized as follows. While in Section&#10;\[sysmod\] we provide BICM-ID system model, in Section \[Guide-Lines\]&#10;we describe the design criteria of MD mappings for BICM-ID over AWGN and&#10;Rayleigh fading channels. In Section \[proposed\_map\], we describe our&#10;proposed MD mapping method. In Section \[num\_result\], we present&#10;numerical results and compare the performance of our resulted mapping.&#10;Finally, Section \[conc.\] concludes the paper.\&#10;NOTATIONS: Throughout the paper, we use a lowercase letter e.g., to&#10;represent a variable, a boldface letter e.g., to denote a row vector,&#10;and to represent th element of .

<outline text="System Model" _note="A BICM-ID system model is shown in Fig. \[sys\_mod\] where a sequence of&#10;information bits is encoded by a convolutional encoder. Then, the coded&#10;bits are randomly interleaved and the interleaved coded bits are grouped&#10;in blocks of bits. For notational convenience, let us denote th block of&#10;interleaved coded bits at the input of the modulator by . The modulator&#10;maps to a vector of consecutive -ary signals, , using a MD mapping&#10;function where denotes the -D -ary signal set. Mathematically, we can&#10;write&#10;&#10;The average energy per symbol-vector is assumed to be , i.e., . At the&#10;receiver, the received signal vector corresponding to the transmitted&#10;symbol-vector can be expressed as&#10;&#10;where is the corresponding vector of the Rayleigh fading coefficients,&#10;represents the transpose of , and is a vector of additive complex white&#10;Gaussian noise samples with zero-mean and variance . We consider two&#10;types of fading channels as follows: (i) all symbols in a symbol-vector&#10;experience a constant fading coefficient, i.e., block-fading channel -&#10;and (ii) the coefficients vary over the consecutive symbols in a&#10;symbol-vector, i.e., fast fading channel. Clearly, corresponds to the&#10;AWGN channel. For brevity, we omit the index in subsequent sections. It&#10;is assumed that the receiver has the perfect channel state information&#10;(CSI).&#10;&#10;At the receiver, the demapper uses the received signal and the A PRIORI&#10;log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the coded bits to compute the extrinsic&#10;LLR for each of the bits in the received symbol as described in . Next,&#10;the random deinterleaver permutes the extrinsic LLRs which are used by&#10;the channel decoder. The decoder uses the BCJR algorithm to calculate&#10;the extrinsic LLR values of the coded bits. These LLR values are&#10;interleaved and fed back to the demapper that uses them as the A PRIORI&#10;LLR values in the next iteration.">

<outline text="Motivation and Design Criteria of MD mappings for BICM-ID" _note="In low SNR region, the performance of BICM-ID depends on the BER at the&#10;first iteration, i.e., BICM-ID is equivalent to BICM. So, the optimum&#10;mapping for BICM-ID in low SNR region corresponds to the optimum mapping&#10;for BICM. However, the optimal mapping designed for low SNR region is&#10;not suitable for BICM-ID in high SNR region. The reason can be explained&#10;as follows. Although the optimal mapping designed for low SNR region&#10;provides an early turbo cliff in BER performance, it offers a poor&#10;error-floor which reaches the BER range of practical interest, e.g., at&#10;a very high SNR value. On the other hand, the mapping, which is designed&#10;to minimize the asymptotic error rate of BICM-ID, results in extremely&#10;low BER at a very high SNR value. Hence, the optimal mapping that&#10;minimizes asymptotic error rate is not very relevant for practical&#10;communication systems. Moreover, finding the optimal mapping that&#10;minimizes error-floor is computationally expensive. Therefore, designing&#10;an efficient MD mapping for BICM-ID that offers good BER in both low and&#10;high SNR regions is very desirable. Motivated by the above discussion,&#10;our objective is to develop an efficient MD mapping method for BICM-ID&#10;to achieve good BER performance over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels&#10;in both low and high SNR regions. In what follows, we investigate the&#10;design criteria to achieve a good mapping for AWGN and Rayleigh fading&#10;channels. It is important to mention that in order to investigate the&#10;design criteria of a suitable mapping in low SNR region, we consider&#10;BICM-ID performance at the first iteration.">

Similar to the block-fading case, it is easy to show that by&#10;decreasing and increasing one can improve at low and high SNR values,&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;In summary, it can be concluded that a mapping which offers a small&#10;value of while it gives a large value of , is suitable to achieve good&#10;error performance of BICM-ID over both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels&#10;in low and high SNR regions. A small value of implies that the average&#10;Hamming distance between neighbouring symbols, i.e., symbols with&#10;Euclidean distance , is small and consequently is small. This eventually&#10;increases and at the first iteration of BICM-ID in Rayleigh fading&#10;channels. So, a small value of can improve the mapping’s performance at&#10;the first iteration, i.e., in low SNR region not only in AWGN channel&#10;but also in Rayleigh fading channels. On the other hand, a large value&#10;of implies that is equal to zero for small values of . This increases&#10;and at high SNR values. As a consequence, the asymptotic BER performance&#10;of BICM-ID improves over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels as the value&#10;of increases.">

<outline text="Proposed Mapping Method" _note="Based on the above discussion, we take a heuristic approach to obtain a&#10;mapping that offers good BER performance in low and high SNR regions&#10;over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, we apply two key&#10;techniques as follows. First, to generate a mapping with a large value&#10;of , we map binary labels with the Hamming distance one to the&#10;symbol-vectors with a large Euclidean distance. This leads to good&#10;error-floors in Rayleigh fading and AWGN channels. Second, most of the&#10;nearest neighbouring symbol-vectors are mapped to the binary labels that&#10;have Hamming distance two. This results in a small value of and yields&#10;good BER performance in low SNR region over AWGN and Rayleigh fading&#10;channels.&#10;&#10;The proposed MD mapping using -QAM symbols is obtained progressively in&#10;steps. The mappings in steps are intermediate mappings whereas the&#10;mapping in step is the final mapping. In th step, symbols from -ary&#10;constellation are selected to be used in the mapping process. The&#10;symbols selection process is descried as below.">
  <outline text="Symbols Selection Process" _note="We assume that position-indexes of symbols in a given QAM constellation,&#10;increase by moving right or down. For example, Fig. \[16QAM\_steps\](a)&#10;shows a -QAM constellation where represents the symbol with&#10;position-index and increases from left to right or from top to bottom.&#10;The GENERAL-PRINCIPLES in choosing symbols from a -QAM constellation in&#10;th step are as follows: (i) by moving the set of selected symbols one&#10;can cover all symbols of the constellation, provided that each symbol is&#10;covered only one time. In other words, the square -QAM constellations&#10;can be partitioned into a number of subsets where the structures/shapes&#10;formed by these subsets are congruent with one another. Thus, by moving&#10;one of the subsets and superimposing it on the remaining subsets, one&#10;can cover all symbols in the constellation while each symbol is covered&#10;only once. (ii) The MSED between the chosen symbols is as large as&#10;possible. Without loss of generality, let us use to denote the set of&#10;chosen symbols in step and indicates the position-indexes of symbols in&#10;. The set of used symbols in step contains all the used symbols in step&#10;, i.e., and .&#10;&#10;In step , four symbols are selected from a 16-QAM constellation to be&#10;used in the mapping process. There are four distinct sets, which are&#10;made of four symbols, as follows: , , , and . It is obvious that by&#10;moving any of these sets, one can cover all symbols of 16-QAM&#10;constellation, provided that each symbol is covered only once. Among&#10;these sets, provides the maximum value of MSED between its symbols. As a&#10;result, for 16-QAM, we have and . In Fig. \[16QAM\_steps\](b) dark&#10;symbols indicate the symbols in .&#10;&#10;In step , eight symbols are selected and these eight symbols should&#10;include all symbols in . There are two sets of eight symbols as follows:&#10;and , that include all symbols in , and also can cover all the symbols&#10;in the constellation by moving right or down. Both and offer the same&#10;MSED between the selected symbols. Therefore, either or can be selected&#10;in step 2. We assume that the set of the selected 16-QAM symbols in the&#10;second step, .

A particular QPSK symbol is&#10;converted to one of symbols in as follows where is the symbol with&#10;position-index in -QAM constellation. It is important to note that ,&#10;converts each QPSK symbol to the corresponding symbol in the 4-ary&#10;constellation created using the four chosen -QAM symbols.

As discussed in Section \[Guide-Lines\], in order to achieve a&#10;good error performance at high SNRs, a larger value of is desired for&#10;AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. Let be the MSED between two&#10;symbol-vectors with Hamming distance one in th step of our proposed&#10;mapping process. As mentioned earlier that the intermediate MD mapping&#10;in first step is equivalent to the optimum MD QPSK mapping developed in&#10;. Therefore, it yields the largest possible value of for the selected&#10;four symbols from -QAM. In order to achieve a large value of , should be&#10;designed such that for . As it is mentioned earlier, it is desirable to&#10;achieve a value of the average Hamming distance between the nearest&#10;symbol-vectors, i.e., , close to two. To meet this goal, is designed&#10;such that the most of the symbol-vectors with the Euclidean distance are&#10;mapped by binary labels with Hamming distance two in each step; where is&#10;the minimum Euclidean distance between the symbols in . Based on the&#10;above discussion, we design as follows.&#10;&#10;Let be a given label in step where and are two binary sequences of&#10;lengths and bits, respectively. Assume that is a binary sequence of bits&#10;and is different from only in th bit position. Then, there are two&#10;possible cases for as follows where and are and bit sequences that have&#10;Hamming distance one from and , respectively. Our first goal is to map&#10;and to the symbol-vectors and , respectively such that Let be a binary&#10;sequence of length and different from in th and th bit positions where .&#10;Then, can be defined as one of the three following possible cases where&#10;is a -bit sequence with Hamming distance two from and is a -bit sequence&#10;with Hamming distance two from .

<outline text="Numerical Results and Discussion" _note="In this section we provide some numerical examples to demonstrate the&#10;performance and advantage of our proposed MD mapping for BICM-ID&#10;systems. We compare our resulted mappings with random mappings and also&#10;with the mappings that are optimized for the considered channel models&#10;using the well-known BSA. According to the BSA, a cost function is&#10;calculated for each symbol in the constellation. The BSA starts with an&#10;initial mapping and then finds the symbol with the highest cost in the&#10;constellation and switches the label of this symbol with the label of&#10;another symbol. As such the total cost is reduced as much as possible .&#10;The BSA is the best known computer search technique to find suitable&#10;mappings for BICM-ID. However, it becomes intractable to obtain good&#10;mappings for MD modulations with higher alphabet size e.g., -D -QAM due&#10;to computational time complexity. The considered random mappings for&#10;each channel type, in this section, are obtained by selecting the best&#10;mappings from a large number of randomly generated mappings. We consider&#10;a rate- convolutional code with the generator polynomial of . An&#10;interleaver of length about bits is used.

Therefore, our mappings&#10;offer improved error-floor bounds as illustrated in Fig.&#10;\[EF\_Quasi\_Rayleigh\].">

  <outline text="Performance in Fast Rayleigh Fading Channel" _note="As mentioned earlier, predicts BER performance of mappings for BICM-ID&#10;in fast Rayleigh fading channel. Table \[Parameters\_FastFading\]&#10;compares the value of for various mappings at different SNR values. In&#10;order to calculate the values of at low and high SNR values we assume&#10;SNR dB and SNR dB, respectively. It is clear from Table&#10;\[Parameters\_FastFading\] that our proposed mappings offer larger&#10;values of at both low and high SNR values. As a result, it is expected&#10;that our proposed mappings improve the BER in comparison with their&#10;counterparts. This is confirmed by the BER plots in Fig.&#10;\[BER\_Fast\_Rayleigh\]. This figure shows that our mappings outperform&#10;the BSA mappings by dB, dB and dB for -D -QAM, -D -QAM, and -D -QAM,&#10;respectively in fast Rayleigh fading channel. The improvement is even&#10;more significant compared to random mappings.">

  <outline text="Convergence Behaviour" _note="Extrinsic information transfer chart (known as EXIT chart) is a suitable&#10;technique to investigate the convergence behavior of BICM-ID systems.&#10;The area between the decoder curve and the demapper curve in EXIT chart&#10;is referred to as EXIT tunnel . To improve the BER performance through&#10;the iterative process, BICM-ID needs to provide an open Exit tunnel.&#10;Fig. \[EXIT\_AWGN\] depicts the EXIT charts for BICM-ID using various D&#10;-QAM mappings in AWGN channel. For brevity, we plot the EXIT chart only&#10;for AWGN channels. The results are very similar for other considered&#10;channel models. It is obvious from this figure that at SNR equal to dB,&#10;BICM-ID with our proposed mapping exhibits an open tunnel. It means that&#10;at SNR values greater than dB, iterative decoding with our proposed&#10;mapping improves the BER performance. However, corresponding value of&#10;SNR using BSA MD mapping or random mappings is about dB. As a result,&#10;the BER performance of BICM-ID systems with our proposed mapping starts&#10;to improve through the iterative decoding process about dB earlier than&#10;those of BSA mapping and random mapping. This also explains the reason&#10;of the early turbo cliff in BER curves which can be observed in Fig.&#10;\[BER\_AWGN\].">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="We have proposed a systematic method to design MD mappings for BICM-ID&#10;systems using - and -QAM constellations. The innovativeness of our&#10;proposed mapping method is that it can efficiently generate MD mappings&#10;using - and -QAM. Presented numerical results have shown that in&#10;comparison with the well-known BSA mappings and random mappings, our&#10;resulted mappings outperform significantly in AWGN, block-fading and&#10;fast fading channels in the BER range of practical interest. Compared to&#10;the BSA mappings for a target BER of , our mappings can save up to [ ]{}&#10;dB, [ ]{} dB, and dB transmit signal power over AWGN, block-fading and&#10;fast fading channels, respectively. The corresponding performance gains&#10;are larger compared to random mappings. The proposed mappings also have&#10;improved error-floor performance compared to random mappings and the&#10;mappings obtained by BSA.&#10;&#10;[bl]{}&#10;&#10;E.
