    <title>Suppression of magnetic excitations near the surface of the topological
Kondo insulator SmB6</title>
    <abstract>We present a detailed investigation of the temperature and depth
dependence of the magnetic properties of 3D topological Kondo insulator
[SmB]{}, in particular near its surface. We find that local magnetic
field fluctuations detected in the bulk are suppressed rapidly with
decreasing depths, disappearing almost completely at the surface. We
attribute the magnetic excitations to spin excitons in bulk [SmB]{},
which produce local magnetic fields of about fluctuating on a time scale
of . We find that the excitonic fluctuations are suppressed when
approaching the surface on a length scale of , accompanied by a small
enhancement in static magnetic fields. We associate this length scale to
the size of the excitonic state. </abstract>
