    <abstract>This paper presents the first MD simulations of a model, which we have
designed for understanding the development of electro-induced
instability of a thin toluene emulsion film in contact with saline
aqueous phase. This study demonstrates the charge accumulation role in
toluene film rupture when a DC electric field is applied. The critical
value of the external field at which film ruptures, thin film charge
distribution, capacitance, number densities and film structure have been
obtained in simulating the system within and ensembles. A mechanism of
thin film rupture driven by the electric discharge is suggested.We show
that ensemble with a constant surface tension is a better choice for
further modeling of the systems that resemble more close the real films. </abstract>
