<outline text="Conclusions" _note="The results of MD simulations and their analysis offer insight into the&#10;intimate structure of the film, namely the presence of a toluene core,&#10;neighboring a mixed boundary zone that contains altogether toluene and&#10;water molecules. Application of external DC electric field leads to&#10;redistribution of electrical charges and to the accumulation of&#10;oppositely charged ions ( and ) on both sides of the film. Thus, the&#10;behavior of the system resembles a liquid capacitor, which charge&#10;increases with the rise of the external potential. In both and&#10;ensembles, [CONDENSER PLATES]{}, where the charge density is maximal,&#10;are situated at the very border between the bulk aqueous (water) phase&#10;and the mixed layer. No ion penetration is observed within the toluene&#10;core, thus leaving all the distribution of charges within the mixed zone&#10;and the bulk phase that could be attributed to the formation of&#10;hydration shells. When critical electric field is reached, within a&#10;certain time after the field application electric discharge occurs,&#10;indicating the beginning of the rupturing process. Visual snapshots of&#10;the evolution of the film area confirm the formation of a hole within&#10;the thinnest part of the initially nonhomogeneously thin film.&#10;&#10;Results clearly show that in simulations the critical instability is&#10;developed at much lower fields (75 ) than in NVT simulations (120 ).&#10;First experimental investigation on electro-induced rupture of real&#10;toluene-diluted bitumen emulsion films shows that critical fields range&#10;between 4 and 11 , depending on the bitumen concentration. Thus,&#10;simulation with a constant surface tension appears to be a better choice&#10;for further modeling of the systems that resemble more close the real&#10;films. In the ensemble we can expect that even lower values of the&#10;external electric field could rupture the toluene film if we prolong the&#10;simulation time. The compressive action of the builtup charges on both&#10;sides of the film is illustrated in the decrease of the thickness of the&#10;toluene core with the electric field. The behavior of the system&#10;resembles a capacitor with increasing charge with an increase of the&#10;external potential. However, in both type of simulations ( and ), the&#10;width of the mixed zone and hence of the total film increases with the&#10;field increase. Moreover, the clarification of the detailed mechanism of&#10;the hole formation (wavelike or porelike) and the role of thickness&#10;fluctuations on the rupturing process could be progressed through&#10;undertaking an extensive “subbox” thickness investigation, when the&#10;entire simulation box is divided into boxes along the xyplane, as each&#10;one of them being analyzed.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, we may argue that the model, we have developed for thin&#10;films, provides a ground for implementing a further complication of the&#10;investigated system, introducing surface active molecules, as well as a&#10;verification of our expectances for a decrease of the critical electric&#10;field when longer simulations are performed.">
