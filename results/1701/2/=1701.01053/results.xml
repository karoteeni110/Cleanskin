  <outline text="simulation - build-up of interfacial charge" _note="The interaction between the toluene film and the surrounding water&#10;molecules and ions results in a dynamic charge distribution. The Figure&#10;\[fig:nvt\_charges\_all\_voltage\] illustrates the ion (sodium and&#10;chlorine) charge density distribution in the -direction. The&#10;distribution is computed within the last of the run (total run time ).&#10;The three curves correspond to , and strengths of the external electric&#10;field. At (red curve), which calibrates the results, the charge&#10;fluctuates around zero at the film interfaces. A non-zero external field&#10;induces charge accumulation at film interfaces. The accumulated charge&#10;is drawn as peaks in the charge distribution. The curves for (green) and&#10;(blue) electric field strengths show that the accumulated charge&#10;increases with the field increase: one interface of the toluene film is&#10;charged positively due to accumulation, while the other interface is&#10;charged negatively due to ion accumulation. Thus, the emulsion film,&#10;subjugated to the external electric field, resembles charging of a&#10;parallel-plate capacitor. At all applied fields the ion charge&#10;fluctuates around zero away from the film.&#10;&#10;Averaging over time was performed over the last 2.5 of the production&#10;run. An external electric field with strengths up to does not rupture&#10;the toluene film for the duration of the simulation - . It should be&#10;noted that the charge distribution obtained at the field within time&#10;intervals less than shown in the Figure \[fig:120mV\_0-05ns\] feature on&#10;average the same patterns as the distribution computed field shown with&#10;a blue line in the Figure \[fig:nvt\_charges\_all\_voltage\].\&#10;Electric discharge is initiated after the pore formation as it is seen&#10;in the Figure \[fig:diff\_120mV\_2-5ns\]. After , the accumulated&#10;interfacial charge is drained - no peaks in the charge distribution of&#10;the ruptured film.&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}">

When the pore is&#10;wide enough water molecules fill in the pore area, seen as a bluish&#10;background in the Figure \[fig:top\_view\_700ps\] at .

  <outline text="simulation - the film structure" _note="The charge density of free ions, water, and toluene molecules in the&#10;-direction can be observed in the Figure&#10;\[fig:nvt\_all\_distributions\]. The figure illustrates the structure of&#10;the toluene film surrounded by aqueous electrolyte solution at , , and&#10;electric field strengths. For the latter case the density was averaged&#10;over the first of simulation, i.e. before the startup of the rupturing&#10;process. The part of the film that contains only toluene molecules is&#10;called toluene [CORE]{}, [BULK]{} water phase is that part of the film,&#10;where the density of water molecules is maximal.&#10;&#10;The core thickness was estimated using a doublesigmoid function&#10;(Equation \[eq:double\_sigmoid\]) at of the plateau height , where ,&#10;being the left and the right half-height respectively, is the steepness&#10;of the sigmoid:&#10;&#10;At no applied field, Figure \[fig:nvt\_dens\_dist\_0mV\] there exists a&#10;pure toluene core of thickness, which is surrounded by two interfacial&#10;layers formed by mixing toluene and water interfacial layers. In the&#10;toluene interfacial layer, the concentration of toluene molecules&#10;decreases in the direction from the pure toluene core towards the bulk&#10;water phases, eventually reaching zero concentration. Respectively, in&#10;the aqueous interfacial layer, the concentration of water molecules&#10;decreases towards the toluene core. Toluenewater mixed layer is thick,&#10;which is estimated as the distance where the toluene density in&#10;-direction drops from to from the plateau height . The bulk aqueous&#10;phases contain and ions. The density profiles show that ions penetrate&#10;the mixed interfacial layers that border the toluene core. Thicknesses&#10;of the film core and the interfacial layer are shown in the Table&#10;\[table:nvt\_film\_thickness\].&#10;&#10;The Figure \[fig:nvt\_dens\_dist\_60mV\] shows that application of field&#10;leads to build-up of accumulated positive charges on one side of the&#10;toluene film and negative charges on the other side. The peaks of&#10;accumulated charges are situated at the boundary between bulk water and&#10;interfacial aqueous layer. In the direction towards toluene core, the&#10;concentration of ions decreases and reaches zero at the toluene core.&#10;Ions penetrate only the mixed interfacial region, which is due to the&#10;formation of hydration shells. The Figure \[fig:nvt\_dens\_dist\_100mV\]&#10;reveals that field increase up to is followed by accumulation of more&#10;charges, bringing enough attractive force that leads to thinning of the&#10;pure toluene core by down to , while the thickness of the interfacial&#10;layers of toluene and water increases by . A possible hypothesis is that&#10;the increased electrical compression reshapes the film topography making&#10;it a high amplitude rugged surface and the interfacial layer becomes&#10;thicker. The Figure \[fig:nvt\_dens\_dist\_120mV\] depicts the film&#10;structure (profile) at and data are averaged over the time interval of .&#10;This is the moment () just before the rupturing process takes place.&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;[.45]{}&#10;&#10;The increase of potential from to leads to additional thinning of the&#10;toluene core down to .

  <outline text="simulation - the film structure" _note="In this section, the results from canonical ensemble simulation are&#10;presented. The charge buildup is plotted in the Figure&#10;\[fig:npt\_charges\_all\_voltage\]. The Figure&#10;\[fig:npt\_all\_distributions\] depicts the charge build-up at , , and .&#10;As in the NVT case, at zero external field no peak formation is observed&#10;on both sides of ionic line that exhibits zero-charge density. At such&#10;formation already takes place and becomes much pronounced at and (Figure&#10;\[fig:npt\_dens\_dist\_75mV\]). Film rupture occurs at a much lower&#10;electric field strength () compared to the NVT simulation (). Film&#10;rupture occurs at a much lower electric field strength () compared to&#10;the NVT simulation (). The information regarding the thickness of the&#10;toluene core, boundary layers and the total film are summarized in Table&#10;\[table:npt\_film\_thickness\]. The thickness of different layers were&#10;again determined by using the doublesigmoid formula in Equation&#10;\[eq:double\_sigmoid\]. At no applied field, the toluene core has the&#10;same thickness as in the NVT case. However, the difference between the&#10;two simulations is revealed in the size of the mixed boundary zone,&#10;being larger for the NPT ensemble. Increase of the electric field, as in&#10;the NVT case, again leads to the thinning of the toluene core and to the&#10;expansion of the boundary layers. However, at (NPT) there is a bit&#10;higher thinning of the core, compared to (NVT), despite of the lower&#10;applied field. This observation, together with the obtained lower&#10;critical field could suggest enhanced development of instability in the&#10;NPT simulation. It should be noted that in both simulations at the&#10;critical field the core has the same thickness instants before the film&#10;rupture. Moreover, at that critical field the thickness of the boundary&#10;layers and of the total layer are almost identical in both and&#10;ensembles.&#10;&#10;[.32]{}&#10;&#10;[.32]{}&#10;&#10;[.32]{}&#10;&#10;. \[fig:npt\_all\_distributions\]">
