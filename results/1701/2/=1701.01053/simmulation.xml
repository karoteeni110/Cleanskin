<outline text="The model and simulation procedure" _note="To accurately simulate the interfacial phenomena, we have applied the&#10;classical MD method for the case of two canonical ensembles - and . The&#10;choice of ensembles in MD simulations of finite-size systems has already&#10;been shown to play an important role in coexisting phases . MD&#10;Simulations provide detailed information on the molecular structure of&#10;the interface when the intermolecular potential is available .\&#10;The model system is a thick toluene film located perpendicularly to the&#10;-axis of the simulation box. The size of the box ensures that no&#10;artifacts will appear when periodic boundary conditions are implemented&#10;to diminish finite-size effects. The box contains also water molecules&#10;and and ions at a concentration of . The force field parameters of the&#10;ions and included in the model are taken from [GROMOS96]{} . Parameters&#10;for toluene molecules are derived from benzyl side chain of&#10;phenylalanine molecule. Three-site (simple point charge) water model is&#10;used .&#10;&#10;Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the model system are&#10;performed with the help of the [GROMACS]{} package, designed to simulate&#10;the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions&#10;of particles . The simulations are performed in canonical and ensembles&#10;which keep the total number of atoms constant; the temperature is . In&#10;the ensemble the constant volume equals to the size of the simulation&#10;box, . In the case of the ensemble the system is equilibrated at the&#10;constant pressure of . After the equilibration, the simulation is&#10;performed at a constant surface tension between toluene and water . In&#10;preliminary MD runs the simulation time of was determined to be&#10;sufficient for thermodynamic equilibration of the total energy,&#10;pressure, and temperature of the model system.\&#10;An external electric field is applied in the direction of the simulation&#10;box. In the ensemble the electric field strength is changed from to in&#10;steps of , while in the ensemble the strength is changed from to in&#10;steps of .">
