<outline text="Introduction" _note="Water-in-oil emulsions are commonly formed during petroleum production&#10;and pose serious threats to installations and quality of the final&#10;product. The electrical phase separation has been used in the petroleum&#10;industry for separating water-in-crude oil dispersion’s by applying a&#10;high electric field onto the flowing emulsion to affect flocculate and&#10;coalescence of dispersed water droplets . It has been realized that the&#10;emulsion is stabilized by a thin film formed between two drops when&#10;approaching each other. Thus demulsification requires rupturing of this&#10;thin liquid film. Generally, the main purpose of an applied electrical&#10;field is to promote contact between the drops and to help in dropdrop&#10;coalescence. Pulsed DC (direct current) and AC (alternative current)&#10;electric fields are preferred over constant DC fields for efficient&#10;coalescence. Recent studies have helped to clarify important aspects of&#10;the process such as partial coalescence and dropdrop non-coalescence but&#10;key phenomena such as thin film breakup and chain formation are still&#10;unclear . Despite of the tremendous practical importance of enhanced&#10;coalescence, the mechanism of separation is not fully understood beyond&#10;the perception that the electrical force facilitates the coalescence&#10;between small drops.\&#10;To help in understanding the inherent processes, computational models&#10;were designed to simulate coalescense of droplets under realistic&#10;experimental conditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) method is an useful&#10;tool for the purpose. Koplik and Banavar did a pioneer work in modeling&#10;the coalescence of two Lennard-Jones liquid droplets in a second&#10;immiscible fluid using MD simulations. The authors found that&#10;coalescence of liquid droplets was completely driven by van der Waals&#10;and electrostatic interactions when the velocities of the droplets were&#10;small. The coalescence began when the molecules on the boundary of one&#10;droplet thermally drifted to the range of attraction of the other&#10;droplet and formed a string to attract both sides of the molecules.\&#10;Zhao et al. reported a MD study of the coalescence of two&#10;nanometer-sized water droplets in n-heptane, a system that is commonly&#10;encountered in the oil sands industry. Similarly, the coalescence&#10;process was initiated by the molecules at the edge of the clusters,&#10;which interacted with each other and formed a bridge between two&#10;clusters. Eventually, these molecules attracted and pulled out other&#10;molecules from their own respective cluster to interact with those from&#10;the other cluster. Authors made an important conclusion that the&#10;coalescence in n-heptane would occurred only if the two droplets were&#10;very close to each other (). If they were far apart (e.g., ), external&#10;driving forces should be applied.&#10;&#10;However, experimental results for electrical properties and electric&#10;field-induced rupture of single thin films are scarce, which limits the&#10;comparison with computations to several measurable quantities - pore&#10;formation, and the critical voltage for film rupture.\&#10;Anklam et al. experimentally demonstrated that the electric-filed&#10;induced pore formation was the reason for break-up of emulsion films.&#10;Panchev et al. developed a method allowing simultaneous investigation of&#10;a single water-in-oil emulsion film by both microinterferometry and&#10;electrical measurements. This method allows in a single experiment to&#10;measure the critical voltage of film rupture, the film thickness, the&#10;drainage rate, and the disjoining pressure laying the groundwork for&#10;computational studies.\&#10;In this paper we present computational results for pore formation and&#10;film rupture obtained with a model, which we have designed to imitate&#10;the rupture of the film under a step-wise increase of the electric field&#10;as it has been applied in the experiment . The film is immersed in a&#10;sodium chloride solution. In the model and also in the experiment, the&#10;electric field is applied perpendicularly to the film, which separates&#10;two water droplets.\&#10;The model of the thin film developed for the present study can be&#10;considered as a useful starting basis for a further study of the&#10;stability and the structure of thick emulsion films that are stabilized&#10;by indigenous crude oil surfactants, namely asphaltenes, resins and&#10;naphthenic acids. It is worth mentioning that so far there is almost&#10;complete lack of understanding of the intimate structural details of the&#10;crude petroleum-like films. Therefore, current industrial practice of&#10;utilization of chemical additives in combination with electric field&#10;applications has for long time been widely viewed as a “work of art”.">
