<outline text="Introduction" _note="Consider a fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a self-similar Gaussian&#10;process with stationary increments. It was introduced by Kolmogorov and&#10;studied by Mandelbrot and Van Ness . The fBm with Hurst parameter is a&#10;centered Gaussian process with covariance function If , then the process&#10;is a standard Brownian motion. When , is neither a semimartingale nor a&#10;Markov process, so that many of the techniques employed in stochastic&#10;analysis are not available for an fBm. The self-similarity and&#10;stationarity of increments make the fBm an appropriate model for many&#10;applications in diverse fields from biology to finance. We refer to for&#10;details on these notions.&#10;&#10;Consider the following stochastic differential equation (SDE) where is a&#10;measurable function, and is a -dimensional fBm with Hurst parameter&#10;whose components are one-dimensional independent fBms defined on a&#10;probability space , where the filtration is generated by , , augmented&#10;by the -null sets. It has been proved in that if satisfies the&#10;assumption for , then Eq. (\[SDE1\]) has a unique strong solution, which&#10;will be assumed throughout this paper.&#10;&#10;Notice that if the drift coefficient is Lipschitz continuous, then&#10;Eq. (\[SDE1\]) has a unique strong solution, which is continuous with&#10;respect to the initial condition. Moreover, the solution can be&#10;constructed using various numerical schemes.&#10;&#10;Our purpose in this paper is to establish some stability results under&#10;the pathwise uniqueness of solutions and under weak regularity&#10;conditions on the drift coefficient . We mention that a considerable&#10;result in this direction has been established in when an fBm is replaced&#10;by a standard Brownian motion.&#10;&#10;The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some&#10;properties, notation, definitions, and preliminary results. Section 3 is&#10;devoted to the study of the variation of solution with respect to the&#10;initial data. In the last section, we drop the continuity assumption on&#10;the drift and try to obtain the same result as in Section 3.">

<outline text="Preliminaries" _note="In this section, we give some properties of an fBm, definitions, and&#10;some tools used in the proofs.&#10;&#10;For any , let us define the square-integrable kernel where , .&#10;&#10;Note that Let be an fBm defined on . We denote by the set of step&#10;functions on . Let be the Hilbert space defined as the closure of with&#10;respect to the scalar product The mapping can be extended to an isometry&#10;between and the Gaussian subspace of associated with , and such an&#10;isometry is denoted by .&#10;&#10;Now we introduce the linear operator from to defined by The operator is&#10;an isometry between and , which can be extended to the Hilbert space .&#10;&#10;Define the process by Then is a Brownian motion; moreover, has the&#10;integral representation We need also to define an isomorphism from onto&#10;associated with the kernel in terms of the fractional integrals as&#10;follows: Note that, for , is the left fractional Riemann-Liouville&#10;integral operator of order defined by where is the gamma function (see&#10;for details).&#10;&#10;The inverse of is given by where for , is the left-sided Riemann&#10;Liouville derivative of order defined by If is absolutely continuous&#10;(see ), then&#10;&#10;On a given probability space , a process is called a strong solution to&#10;if&#10;&#10; is adapted, where is the filtration generated by ;&#10;&#10; satisfies .&#10;&#10;A sextuple is called a weak solution to if&#10;&#10; is a probability space equipped with the filtration that satisfies the&#10;usual&#10;&#10; is an -adapted process, and is an -fBm;&#10;&#10; and satisfy .&#10;&#10;We say that pathwise uniqueness holds for Eq.  if whenever and are two&#10;weak solutions of Eq.  defined on the same probability space , then and&#10;are indistinguishable.&#10;&#10;The main tool used in the proofs is Skorokhod’s selection theorem given&#10;by the following lemma.&#10;&#10;Let be a complete separable metric space, and let , , , be probability&#10;measures on such that converges weakly to as . Then, on a probability&#10;space , we can construct -valued random variables , , , such that:&#10;&#10;, , and , where and are respectively the laws of and ;&#10;&#10; converges to -a.s.&#10;&#10;We will also make use of the following result, which gives a criterion&#10;for the tightness of sequences of laws associated with continuous&#10;processes.&#10;&#10;\[tightness\] Let , , , be a sequence of -dimensional continuous&#10;processes satisfying the following two conditions:&#10;&#10;There exist positive constants and such that for every ;&#10;&#10;there exist positive constants , , , , such that, for every and all , ,&#10;&#10;Then, there exist a subsequence , a probability space , and -dimensional&#10;continuous processes , , , defined on such that&#10;&#10;The laws of and coincide;&#10;&#10; converges to uniformly on every finite time interval -a.s.">

<outline text="Variation of solutions with respect to initial conditions" _note="The purpose of this section is to ensure the continuous dependence of&#10;the solution with respect to the initial condition when the drift is&#10;continuous and bounded. Note that, in the case of ordinary differential&#10;equation, the continuity of the coefficient is sufficient to ensure this&#10;dependence.&#10;&#10;Next, we give a theorem that will be essential in establishing the&#10;desired result.&#10;&#10;\[main\] Let be a continuous bounded function. Then, under the pathwise&#10;uniqueness for SDE , we have&#10;&#10;Before we proceed to the proof of Theorem \[main\], we state the&#10;following technical lemma.&#10;&#10;\[tight\] Let be the solution of corresponding to the initial condition&#10;. Then, for every , there exists a positive constant such that, for all&#10;,&#10;&#10;Fix in . We have Due to the stationarity of the increments and the&#10;scaling property of an fBm and the boundedness of , we get that which&#10;finishes the proof.&#10;&#10;Let us now turn to the proof of Theorem \[main\].&#10;&#10;Suppose that the result of the theorem is false. Then there exist a&#10;constant and a sequence converging to such that Let (respectively, ) be&#10;the solution of (\[SDE1\]) corresponding to the initial condition&#10;(respectively, ). According to Lemma \[tight\], the sequence satisfies&#10;conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma \[tightness\]. Then, by Skorokhod’s&#10;selection theorem there exist a subsequence , a probability space , and&#10;stochastic processes , , , defined on such that:&#10;&#10;for each , the laws of and coincide;&#10;&#10; converges to uniformly on every finite time interval -a.s.&#10;&#10;Thanks to property , we have, for and , In other words, satisfies the&#10;following SDE: Similarly, Using , we deduce that and in probability and&#10;uniformly in .&#10;&#10;Thus, the processes and satisfy the same SDE on with the same driving&#10;noise and the initial condition . Then, by pathwise uniqueness, we&#10;conclude that for all , -a.s.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, by uniform integrability we have that which is a&#10;contradiction. Then the desired result follows.">

<outline text="The case of discontinuous drift coefficient" _note="In this section, we drop the continuity assumption on the drift&#10;coefficient and only assume that is bounded. The goal of this section is&#10;to generate the same result as in Theorem \[main\] without the&#10;continuity assumption.&#10;&#10;Next, in order to use the fractional Girsanov theorem given in we should&#10;first check that the conditions imposed in the latter are satisfied in&#10;our context. This will be done in the following lemma.&#10;&#10;\[gir\] Suppose that is a solution of SDE , and let be a bounded&#10;function. Then the process enjoys the following properties:&#10;&#10;;&#10;&#10;.&#10;&#10;\(1) In light of , we can write where denotes the norm in .&#10;&#10;As a result, we get that (2) The second item is obtained easily by the&#10;following estimate: where , which finishes the proof.&#10;&#10;Next, we will establish the following Krylov-type inequality that will&#10;play an essential role in the sequel.&#10;&#10;\[krylov1\] Suppose that is a solution of SDE . Then, there exists such&#10;that, for any measurable nonnegative function , we have where is a&#10;constant depending only on , , , and .&#10;&#10;Let be a -dimensional Brownian motion such that For the process&#10;introduced in Lemma \[gir\], let us define by Then, in light of&#10;Lemma \[gir\] together with the fractional Girsanov theorem , we can&#10;conclude that is a probability measure under which the process is an&#10;fBm.&#10;&#10;Now, applying Hölder’s inequality, we have where , and is a positive&#10;constant depending only on , , and .&#10;&#10;From we can see that satisfies the following property: where is a&#10;continuous increasing function depending only on , , and .&#10;&#10;On the other hand, applying again Hölder’s inequality with and , we&#10;obtain A direct calculation gives Plugging this into , we get Finally,&#10;combining this with and , we get estimate with . The proof is now&#10;complete.&#10;&#10;Now we are able to state the main result of this section.&#10;&#10;If the pathwise uniqueness holds for Eq. , then without the continuity&#10;assumption on the drift coefficient, the conclusion of Theorem \[main\]&#10;remains valid.&#10;&#10;The proof is similar to that of Theorem \[main\]. The only difficulty is&#10;to show that in probability. In other words, for , we will show that Let&#10;us first define where denotes the convolution on , and is an infinitely&#10;differentiable function with support in the unit ball such that .&#10;&#10;Applying Chebyshev’s inequality, we obtain From the continuity of in and&#10;from the convergence of to uniformly on every finite time interval&#10;a.s. it follows that converges to 0 as for every .&#10;&#10;On the other hand, let be a smooth truncation function such that in the&#10;unit ball and for .&#10;&#10;By applying Lemma \[krylov1\] we obtain where does not depend on and ,&#10;and denotes the norm in .&#10;&#10;The last expression in the right-hand side of the last inequality&#10;satisfies the following estimate: But we know that for all , and thus&#10;Substituting estimate into , letting , and using , we deduce that the&#10;convergence of the term follows.&#10;&#10;Finally, since estimate also holds for , it suffices to use the same&#10;arguments as before to obtain the convergence of the term , which&#10;completes the proof.">
