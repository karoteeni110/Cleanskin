In this&#10;direction, it is introduced in a notion of STRONGLY REGULAR PARAMETERS&#10;with the property that is a NON-UNIFORMLY HYPERBOLIC HORSESHOE whenever&#10;is a strongly regular parameter. Furthermore, it is showed in that MOST&#10;parameters are strongly regular in the sense that for heteroclinic&#10;tangencies associated to SLIGHTLY THICK horseshoes, i.e., when the&#10;initial horseshoe satisfies where and (resp.) are the transverse&#10;Hausdorff dimensions of the invariant sets and (resp.).

  <outline text="Outline of the proof of the main result" _note="The stable of a non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe is naturally&#10;decomposed into a “well-behaved” part and an “exceptional” part (cf.&#10;Subsection 11.6 of and/or Section \[s.preliminaries\] below).&#10;&#10;Roughly speaking, the well-behaved part of consists of points captured&#10;by “stable curves” obtained as the intersections of decreasing sequences&#10;of certain domains (“strips”) where adequate iterates of the dynamics&#10;behave like “affine hyperbolic maps” (in appropriate coordinates).&#10;&#10;From these features of the dynamics on the well-behaved part of , it is&#10;possible to show that its decomposition into stable curves is a&#10;lamination with -leaves and Lipschitz holonomy (cf. Subsection 10.5 of )&#10;whose transverse Hausdorff dimension is close to the stable dimension of&#10;the initial horseshoe (cf. Theorem 4 in Subsection 10.10 of ).&#10;&#10;In particular, the well-behaved part of has Hausdorff dimension , and,&#10;hence, our task consists into studying the geometry of the exceptional&#10;part of .&#10;&#10;In other words, the proof of Theorem \[t.MPY-A\] is reduced to show that&#10;the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional part of is .&#10;&#10;By definition, the exceptional part of consists of points whose forward&#10;orbits get “very close” to the “critical locus” (of tangencies)&#10;infinitely many times. In fact, between “affine-like hyperbolic”&#10;iterations, the forward orbit of a point in visits a sequence of domains&#10;(“parabolic cores of strips ”) close to the critical locus whose&#10;“widths” decay with a DOUBLE EXPONENTIAL rate (cf. Lemma 24 of ).&#10;&#10;The scenario described in the previous paragraph imposes STRONG&#10;GEOMETRICAL CONSTRAINTS on . For the sake of comparison, it is worth to&#10;point out that the forward orbit of a point in the stable set of a&#10;UNIFORMLY hyperbolic horseshoe visits a sequence of “strips” (cylinders&#10;of a Markov partition) whose “widths” decay with an EXPONENTIAL rate. In&#10;particular, this suggests that is very small when compared with the&#10;well-behaved part of .&#10;&#10;We show that by combining the geometrical constraints on its forward&#10;iterates described above with the following simple argument.&#10;&#10;We know that, between affine-like iterations, the forward images of a&#10;point in under the dynamics fall in a sequence of strips , , whose&#10;widths decay with a double exponential rate. By fixing large and&#10;decomposing the strip into squares, we obtain a covering of very small&#10;diameter of the image of under some positive iterate of the dynamics.&#10;&#10;Now, we want to use negative iterates of the dynamics to bring this&#10;covering of back to . On one hand, we observe that each square becomes a&#10;strip under affine-like iterates of the dynamics. On the other hand,&#10;these strips might get folded during non-affine-like iterations (when&#10;the strips visit the parabolic cores of ). Since these folding effects&#10;can accumulate very quickly, it is not easy to keep control of their&#10;fine geometry in our way back from to .&#10;&#10;Fortunately, if one wants just to prove that , then we can simply&#10;“forget” about the fine details of the geometries of these folded strips&#10;inside the , , by thinking of them as “fat strips”. In other words, when&#10;the strips acquire “parabolic shapes” due to the folds occuring inside&#10;’s, we treat these “parabolic shapes” as NEW strips, we decompose them&#10;into NEW squares and we bring back each of these squares INDIVIDUALLY&#10;under the dynamics. Of course, the number of squares increases&#10;SIGNIFICANTLY each time we perform this procedure, but we will see that&#10;the resulting cover of has a MILD cardinality (in comparison with its&#10;diamater) thanks to the double exponential decay of the widths of ’s and&#10;the affine-like features of the dynamics between consecutive passages&#10;through the parabolic cores of ’s. In particular, by letting vary, this&#10;argument will provide a sequence of covers of whose diameters approach&#10;zero allowing to conclude that , and, A FORTIORI, the proof of Theorem&#10;\[t.MPY-A\].">

  <outline text="Strongly regular parameters" _note="Up to a reparametrization, we can assume that the parameter coordinate&#10;of the -parameter family is normalized by the relative speed at the&#10;quadratic tangency: in other words, is the (oriented) distance between a&#10;piece of near and the tip of the parabolic arc consisting of a piece of&#10;near (see Section 4 of for more details).&#10;&#10;The STRONGLY REGULAR PARAMETERS in are defined via an inductive scheme.&#10;Roughly speaking, we consider two very small constants and we define a&#10;sequence of scales , . The inductive scheme begins with the CANDIDATE&#10;interval . At the th step of the inductive scheme, we divide the&#10;selected candidate intervals of the previous step into disjoint&#10;candidates of lengths .

We will come back to this&#10;point later.&#10;&#10;Of course, the notion of strong regularity tests in is interesting for&#10;at least two reasons. Firstly, it is sufficiently rich to guarantee&#10;several nice properties of “non-uniform hyperbolicity” of for strongly&#10;regular parameters. Secondly, it is also a sufficiently mild constraint&#10;satisfied by a set of large measure of parameters. More precisely, it is&#10;shown in Corollary 15 of that the set of strongly regular parameters has&#10;Lebesgue measure .&#10;&#10;Before describing the nature of strong regularity tests, we will need&#10;the preparatory material from the next three subsections where an&#10;adequate class of AFFINE-LIKE ITERATES of will be attached to each&#10;candidate interval .">

Of course, this&#10;hyperbolic structure is not preserved by the folding map (as it might&#10;exchange almost horizontal and almost vertical directions) and this is&#10;the main source of non-hyperbolicity of .&#10;&#10;In particular, it is not surprising that the definition in of&#10;non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes involves the features of a certain&#10;class of affine-like iterates of .

<outline text="The stable set  has Hausdorff dimension" _note="By Proposition \[p.HD-Ws-E+\] (and Remark \[r.time-symmetric\]), the&#10;proof of Theorem \[t.MPY-A\] is reduced to the following statement:&#10;&#10;\[t.MPY-A-1\] .&#10;&#10;We begin the proof of Theorem \[t.MPY-A-1\] by showing the following&#10;lemma:&#10;&#10;\[l.mdE+P0...Pk\] Fix and let . Then, the -Hausdorff measure at scale of&#10;satisfies for any and any admissible .&#10;&#10;Let be admissible. By definition,&#10;&#10;Since , i.e., , for all , it follows from Proposition 62 of that:&#10;&#10; is a subregion of with diameter , and, a fortiori, is contained in a&#10;horizontal strip of width&#10;&#10; is a subregion of of diameter .&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the affine-like iterate expands the horizontal&#10;direction by a factor and contracts the vertical direction by a factor .&#10;It follows from item (b) above that is contained in a vertical strip of&#10;width .&#10;&#10;In particular, we deduce that is contained in a rectangular region of&#10;dimensions (in the horizontal direction) and (in the vertical&#10;direction). By partitioning this rectangular region into squares of&#10;sides of lengths , we obtain a covering of by squares whose sides have&#10;length .&#10;&#10;From the covering , we produce a covering of by analyzing INDIVIDUALLY&#10;the evolution of the elements of under the backward iterates of using&#10;the following INDUCTIVE procedure.&#10;&#10;At the -th step, we have squares of dimensions forming a covering of&#10;Since the affine-like iterate expands the horizontal direction by a&#10;factor and contracts the vertical direction by a factor (and the folding&#10;map is fixed), we see that the inverse of sends each element of into a&#10;rectangular region of dimensions (in the horizontal direction) and (in&#10;the vertical direction). By partitioning each of these rectangular&#10;regions into squares with sides of length , we get a covering of by&#10;squares whose sides have length .&#10;&#10;In the end of the -th step of this procedure, we obtain a covering of by&#10;squares of sides of length .&#10;&#10;Observe that, by , one has . In particular, we can use the covering of&#10;to get the estimate&#10;&#10;This proves the lemma.&#10;&#10;\[r.MPY-A-idea\] The basic idea to prove the previous lemma is the&#10;following. We start by covering an adequate forward iterate of with&#10;little squares and we bring back this covering under the dynamics. The&#10;affine-like iterates will stretch these squares into vertical strips&#10;and, BEFORE the folding map “bend” these strips (making their geometry&#10;very intricate), we subdivide each strip into smaller squares in order&#10;to keep a QUALITATIVE control of the covering after the folding map&#10;acts.&#10;&#10;Of course, we lose control of the FINE geometrical structure of in this&#10;argument and this is why one can not hope to apply Lemma&#10;\[l.mdE+P0...Pk\] to get the expected Hausdorff dimension for (see also&#10;Remark \[r.expected-dimension-MPY-A\] below).&#10;&#10;The next lemma says that the estimate in Lemma \[l.mdE+P0...Pk\] is&#10;particularly useful when the parameter is chosen close to :&#10;&#10;\[l.mdE+P0...Pk2\] Assume that and (where and satisfies and ). Then, in&#10;the setting of Lemma \[l.mdE+P0...Pk\], one has where is close to (and ,&#10;are the transverse Hausdorff dimensions of the well-behaved parts of and&#10;).&#10;&#10;Since (as ), we can combine[^1] with Lemma \[l.mdE+P0...Pk\] to deduce&#10;that&#10;&#10;Fix close to : this choice is possible because the dimension condition&#10;ensures that . In particular, (as and ) and hence This shows the lemma.&#10;&#10;At this point, we are ready to complete the proof of Theorem&#10;\[t.MPY-A-1\] (and, a fortiori, Theorem \[t.MPY-A\]).&#10;&#10;Fix close to so that and .&#10;&#10;For each , consider the decomposition&#10;&#10;Since and , we can apply Lemma \[l.mdE+P0...Pk2\] to deduce that where&#10;is close to .&#10;&#10;As it was shown in page 193 of (after (11.77)), the quantity of&#10;admissible sequences with fixed extremities and is . Since the&#10;admissibility condition implies that are critical (in the sense of the&#10;definition at page 37 of ), we get from the previous estimate that On&#10;the other hand, we know from Subsection 11.5.10 of that where is a&#10;parameter defined at pages 135 and 138 of , and from Subsection 11.5.9&#10;of that&#10;&#10;Since and (cf. ), we conclude that Because , by letting , we see that&#10;the Hausdorff measures along a sequence of scales .&#10;&#10;Therefore, . This proves Theorem \[t.MPY-A-1\] (and also Theorem&#10;\[t.MPY-A\] in view of Proposition \[p.HD-Ws-E+\]).&#10;&#10;\[r.expected-dimension-MPY-A\] Still along the lines of Remark&#10;\[r.MPY-A-idea\] above, let us observe that the argument used in the&#10;proof of Theorem \[t.MPY-A-1\] does NOT allow us to show that when .&#10;Indeed, among the several conditions imposed on the parameter with , we&#10;required that and . Because and , if we want to take , then the&#10;inequality must hold. However, it is NEVER the case that when : indeed,&#10;by , one has .&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;J. Palis and J.-C.
