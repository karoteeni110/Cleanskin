    <title>Duality between Lagrangian and Legendrian invariants</title>
    <abstract>Consider a pair , of a Weinstein manifold with an exact Lagrangian
submanifold , with ideal contact boundary , where is a contact manifold
and is a Legendrian submanifold. We introduce the Chekanov-Eliashberg
DG-algebra, , with coefficients in chains of the based loop space of and
study its relation to the Floer cohomology of . Using the augmentation
induced by , can be expressed as the Adams cobar construction applied to
a Legendrian coalgebra, . We define a twisting cochain: via holomorphic
curve counts, where denotes the bar construction and the graded linear
dual. We show under simply-connectedness assumptions that the
corresponding Koszul complex is acyclic which then implies that and are
Koszul dual. In particular, induces a quasi-isomorphism between and the
cobar of the Floer homology of , .

This generalizes the classical Koszul duality result between and for a
simply-connected manifold, where is the based loop space of , and
provides the natural geometric ingredient explaining the computations
given in in the case when is a plumbing of cotangent bundles of
2-spheres (where an additional weight grading ensured Koszulity of ).

We use the duality result to show that under certain connectivity and
locally finiteness assumptions, is quasi-isomorphic to for any
Lagrangian filling of .

Our constructions have interpretations in terms of wrapped Floer
cohomology after versions of Lagrangian handle attachments. In
particular, we outline a proof that is quasi-isomorphic to the wrapped
Floer cohomology of a fiber disk in the Weinstein domain obtained by
attaching to along (or, in the terminology of the wrapped Floer
cohomology of in with wrapping stopped by ). </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In this introduction we first give an overview of our results. The&#10;overview starts with a review of well known counterparts of our&#10;constructions in algebraic topology. We then introduce our Legendrian&#10;and Lagrangian invariants in Sections \[ssec:partwrap\] and&#10;\[ssec:infinteswrap\], respectively, and discuss the connection between&#10;them and applications thereof in Section \[ssec:connections\]. Finally,&#10;in Section \[ssec:Hopflink\] we give detailed calculations of the&#10;invariants introduced in the simple yet illustrative example of the&#10;Legendrian Hopf link filled by two Lagrangian disks intersecting&#10;transversely in one point.&#10;&#10;The starting point for our study is a construction in classical&#10;topology. Consider the following augmented DG-algebras over a field&#10;associated to a based, connected, topological space : where is the&#10;singular cochain complex equipped with the cup-product and is the&#10;singular chain complex of the based loop space of equipped with the&#10;Pontryagin product. (We use cohomologically graded complexes throughout&#10;the paper so that all differentials increase the grading by 1.) In the&#10;case of singular cohomology, the inclusion gives the augmentation and in&#10;the case of the based loop space, the augmentation is given by the&#10;trivial local system .&#10;&#10;If is of finite-type (for example, a finite CW-complex), then it is well&#10;known that one can recover the augmented DG-algebra from the augmented&#10;DG-algebra by the Eilenberg-Moore equivalence: In the other direction,&#10;if is SIMPLY CONNECTED, then the Adams construction gives a&#10;quasi-isomorphism and in this case and are said to be KOSZUL DUAL&#10;DG-algebras. Koszul duality is sometimes abbreviated and simply called&#10;DUALITY. For more general , using the method of acyclic models, Brown&#10;constructed a twisting cochain This is a degree 1 map that induces a&#10;DG-algebra map . By definition, the latter is a quasi-isomorphism when&#10;duality holds, and this can be detected by an associated KOSZUL COMPLEX,&#10;which is acyclic if and only if duality holds. In the general case, is a&#10;certain completion of and consequently is a more refined invariant of&#10;than .&#10;&#10;In this paper, we pursue this idea in the context of invariants&#10;associated to Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds. Here the role&#10;played by simple connectivity in the above discussion have two natural&#10;counterparts, one corresponds to a generalized notion of&#10;simply-connectedness for intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds and the&#10;other is the usual notion of simply-connectedness for Legendrian&#10;submanifolds. We start with the geometric data of a Liouville domain&#10;with convex boundary and an exact Lagrangian submanifold with Legendrian&#10;boundary . We assume that , that the Maslov class of vanishes (for&#10;grading purposes) and that is relatively spin (to orient certain moduli&#10;spaces of holomorphic disks). Assume that is subdivided into embedded&#10;components intersecting transversely and that is subdivided into&#10;connected components . To avoid notational complications, we take both&#10;parametrized by the same finite set and assume that the boundary of is .&#10;We use a base field and define the semi-simple ring generated by&#10;mutually orthogonal idempotents . Also, we fix a partition into two&#10;disjoint sets, and choose a base-point for each .&#10;&#10;For simplicity, let us restrict, in this introduction, to the following&#10;situation:&#10;&#10; is a subcritical Liouville domain,&#10;&#10;If then the corresponding Legendrian is an embedded SPHERE.&#10;&#10;From a technical point of view, these restrictions are unnecessary. We&#10;make them in order to facilitate the explanation of the meaning of our&#10;constructions for Legendrian surgery. (Note that, the topology of is&#10;unrestricted when .)&#10;&#10;We write for the completion of the Liouville “sector” obtained from by&#10;attaching critical Weinstein handles along for each and cotangent cones&#10;along for each . If , is an ordinary Liouville manifold. In general, it&#10;looks like a neighborhood of the zero section in the cotangent bundle ,&#10;for some , outside a compact subset. Hence it is a geometrically bounded&#10;manifold, Gromov compactness holds , and holomorphic curve theory is&#10;well-behaved.&#10;&#10;In , for , there is a closed exact Lagrangian submanifold , the union of&#10;the Lagrangian in and the LAGRANGIAN CORE DISK of the Weinstein handle&#10;attached to , and for , there is a non-compact Lagrangian obtained by&#10;attaching the cylindrical boundary to for , which we will still denote&#10;by , by abuse of notation, even when we view them now in . Dually, for&#10;each , we obtain (non-compact) exact Lagrangian disks , the LAGRANGIAN&#10;COCORE DISKS of the Weinstein handles attached to on , and for each , we&#10;construct DUAL Lagrangians disks intersecting once and asymptotic to a&#10;Legendrian meridian of (these can be constructed as the cotangent fiber&#10;at the point , , in , where is the base points on ).&#10;&#10;The invariants that we will construct are associated to the union of&#10;Lagrangian submanifolds The Lagrangian will be referred to as a&#10;LAGRANGIAN SKELETON of , it is a union of Lagrangian submanifolds which&#10;intersect transversely. The dual Lagrangian is the union of Lagrangian&#10;disks which can be locally identified with cotangent fibers to&#10;irreducible components of .&#10;&#10;We will study two algebraic invariants associated to . The first one is&#10;the LEGENDRIAN -ALGEBRA, . It corresponds to the endomorphism algebra of&#10;considered in the infinitesimal Fukaya category of . The second one is&#10;the CHEKANOV-ELIASHBERG DG-ALGEBRA, . It corresponds to the endomorphism&#10;algebra of considered in the partially wrapped Fukaya category of .&#10;However, we will take the pre-surgery perspective as in and construct&#10;all these invariants by studying Legendrian invariants of rather than&#10;Floer cohomology in . From this perspective, the case is a new&#10;construction, that generalizes the theory from in a way analogous to how&#10;partially wrapped Fukaya categories generalizes wrapped Fukaya&#10;categories .&#10;&#10;The invariants and come equipped with canonical augmentations to the&#10;semi-simple ring and it is easy to see by construction that is&#10;determined by via the equivalence: The duality which would recover from&#10;holds in the “simply-connected” case (see Section \[algkoszul\]). In the&#10;topological case discussed above, this is analogous to the&#10;simply-connectedness assumption on , which makes the augmented algebras&#10;and Koszul dual. In fact, the topological case is a special case of our&#10;study for the Weinstein manifold , with the Lagrangian skeleton given by&#10;the 0-section, and the dual Lagrangian given by a cotangent fiber .&#10;&#10;We next sketch the definition of our version of the Chekanov-Eliashberg&#10;DG-algebra (without any assumption of simply-connectedness). This is the&#10;DG-algebra over called above. Its underlying -bimodule is the unital&#10;-algebra freely generated by Reeb chords between components of and&#10;chains in for . (This is the crucial distinctions between and .)&#10;&#10;We use the cubical chain complex (cf. ) for , see Section&#10;\[Coefficients\] for a discussion of other possible choices of chain&#10;models, to express as a free algebra over generated by Reeb chords and&#10;generators of for . Since is a free algebra over , the differential is&#10;determined by its action on generators. On a generator of we simply&#10;apply the usual differential. On a generator which is a Reeb chord, the&#10;differential is determined by moduli spaces of holomorphic disks in the&#10;symplectization which asymptotically converge to on the positive end and&#10;chords at the negative end as follows.&#10;&#10;(2,3) to\[in=90,out=270\] (-0.5,0); (0,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (0.5,0);&#10;(1,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (1.5,0); (2,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (2.5,0);&#10;(3,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (3.5,0); (4,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (4.5,0);&#10;(2.5,3) to\[in=90,out=270\] (5,0); (0,0) to (-0.5,0); (1,0) to (0.5,0);&#10;(2,0) to (1.5,0); (3,0) to (2.5,0); (4,0) to (3.5,0); (5,0) to (4.5,0);&#10;(2.5,3) to (2,3);&#10;&#10;at (2.3, 3.3) ; at (-0.25,-0.3) ; at (0.75,-0.3) ; at (1.75,-0.3) ; at&#10;(2.75,-0.3) ; at (3.75,-0.3) ; at (4.75,-0.3) ;&#10;&#10;at (1,2) ; at (0.25, 0.3) ; at (2.25, 0.3) ; at (3.25, 0.3) ;&#10;&#10;Consider the moduli space of -holomorphic maps , where is a disk with&#10;boundary punctures that are mutually distinct and respects the&#10;counter-clockwise cyclic order of , and sends the boundary component of&#10;to , and is asymptotic to near the puncture at for and to near the&#10;puncture at . The moduli space, which is naturally a stratified space&#10;with manifold strata that carries a fundamental chain, comes with&#10;evaluation maps to for . The image of the fundamental chain determines a&#10;word in our chain model of . Reading these together with the Reeb chords&#10;in order gives the differential of .&#10;&#10;We remark that loop space coefficients were used in the context of&#10;Lagrangian Floer cohomology before . See also , for uses of&#10;high-dimensional moduli spaces in Floer theory.&#10;&#10;While with loop space coefficients is a powerful invariant, it is in&#10;general hard to compute as it involves high-dimensional moduli spaces of&#10;disks. As mentioned above, duality in the Legendrian will also play a&#10;role. More precisely, we define another DG-algebra related to via a&#10;Morse theoretic version of Adams cobar construction whose definition&#10;involves taking parallel copies of but uses only 0-dimensional moduli&#10;spaces (see Section \[ssec:parallelcopies\]). In fact, we prove that the&#10;two DG-algebras are quasi-isomorphic when for are simply-connected.&#10;&#10;There exists a DG-algebra map which is a quasi-isomorphism when is&#10;simply-connected for all .">
  <outline text="Partially wrapped Fukaya categories by surgery" _note="Let be a Legendrian submanifold and as above. Furthermore, we use the&#10;notation above for co-core disks and write . An important result that is&#10;implicit in is the following:&#10;&#10;\[srgry\] Suppose , then there exists a surgery map defined via a&#10;holomorphic disk count that gives an quasi-isomorphism between the&#10;wrapped Floer cochain complex and the Legendrian DG-algebra .&#10;&#10;A complete proof of this result has not yet appeared in the literature.&#10;See Appendix \[ssec:CWBEE\] for a discussion and a proof sketch. In&#10;Appendix \[sec:CWnoHam\], one can also find a construction of wrapped&#10;Floer algebra which uses only purely holomorphic disks, and a proof that&#10;this agrees with the more standard version defined in which uses&#10;Hamiltonian perturbations.&#10;&#10;One of the main guiding principles for the results in this paper is that&#10;Theorem \[srgry\] remains true when is non-empty, provided the&#10;Lagrangians are considered as objects of the PARTIALLY WRAPPED Fukaya&#10;category of , where the non-capped Legendrians for serve as STOPS (cf.&#10;). The full proof of this result when is non-empty will appear&#10;elsewhere. We give an outline in Appendix \[ssec:CWpwrap\]. Here we will&#10;use the geometric intuition provided by this viewpoint and our&#10;constructions of Legendrian invariants provide a rigorous “working&#10;definition” of even in the case that is non-empty, and also a starting&#10;point for the study of “partially wrapped Fukaya categories” via&#10;Legendrian surgery (extending the scope of considerably). For future&#10;reference, we state this result as a conjecture:&#10;&#10;\[conjintro\] There exists a surgery map defined via moduli spaces of&#10;holomorphic disks which gives an quasi-isomorphism between the partially&#10;wrapped Floer cochain complex and the DG-algebra .&#10;&#10;While writing this paper, we learned that Z. Sylvan independently&#10;considered a similar conjecture in relation with his theory of partially&#10;wrapped Fukaya categories .">

  <outline text="Augmentations and infinitesimal Fukaya categories" _note="We keep the notation above and now consider an exact Lagrangian filling&#10;in of . Such a filling gives an augmentation For chords on components ,&#10;this is well known and given by a count of rigid disks with one positive&#10;puncture and boundary on . For chords on components , the same count&#10;composed with the augmentation on corresponding to the trivial local&#10;system gives the augmentation. This allows us to write for an coalgebra&#10;that we call the LEGENDRIAN -COALGEBRA (which depends on ). Here is the&#10;Adams cobar construction.

  <outline text="Duality between partially wrapped and infinitesimal Fukaya categories" _note="We study duality in the setting of the two categories described above:&#10;the partially wrapped Fukaya category and the infinitesimal Fukaya&#10;category of (after surgery), or equivalently, the augmented DG-algebra&#10;and the augmented algebra (before surgery).&#10;&#10;As we have seen in Theorem \[generation\], the augmented DG-algebra&#10;determines the augmented (unital) algebra . Now, a natural question is&#10;to what extent the quasi-isomorphism type of the algebra determines the&#10;quasi-isomorphism type of the augmented Legendrian DG-algebra .&#10;&#10;We emphasize here the phrase “quasi-isomorphism type”: even though it is&#10;possible to construct chain models of the algebra (which is&#10;quasi-isomorphic to ) and the DG-algebra by counting “the same”&#10;holomorphic disks interpreted in different ways, the two algebras are&#10;considered with respect to different equivalence relations, and the&#10;resulting equivalence classes can be very different. In particular, it&#10;is NOT generally true that being a quasi-isomorphism of -coalgebras&#10;implies that is a quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;We will study this question by (geometrically) constructing a TWISTING&#10;COCHAIN (see Section \[twisting\]): where stands for the bar&#10;construction and is the graded -dual. This twisting cochain induces a&#10;map of DG-algebras: which is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if is a&#10;KOSZUL twisting cochain. For example, we will prove the following&#10;result.&#10;&#10;Suppose that is a locally finite, simply-connected -bimodule, then the&#10;natural map is a quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;This is an instance of KOSZUL DUALITY between the algebras and . This&#10;duality has many useful implications. For example, it implies an&#10;isomorphism between Hochschild cohomologies: When , an isomorphism&#10;defined via a surgery map was described between SYMPLECTIC COHOMOLOGY, ,&#10;and the Hochschild cohomology . Therefore, when duality holds, we obtain&#10;a more economical way of computing .&#10;&#10;In the case of cotangent bundles of simply-connected manifolds , this&#10;recovers a classical result due to Jones , which gives: where is&#10;simply-connected manifold of dimension and denotes the free loop space&#10;of .&#10;&#10;In Section \[ssec:applications\], we give several concrete examples&#10;where the duality holds beyond the case of cotangent bundles. For&#10;example, the duality holds for plumbings of simply-connected cotangent&#10;bundles according to an arbitrary plumbing tree, see Theorem \[plumbs\].&#10;&#10;In another direction, combining duality and Floer cohomology with local&#10;coefficients, we establish the following result for relatively spin&#10;exact Lagrangian fillings with vanishing Maslov class of a Legendrian&#10;submanifold .&#10;&#10;Let and assume that and that is simply-connected. If is supported in&#10;degrees , then is simply connected. Moreover, if is a sphere then is&#10;isomorphic to , where , for a disk with boundary .&#10;&#10;In general, duality between and does not hold (as can be seen for&#10;example by looking at cotangent bundles of non-simply connected&#10;manifolds or, letting be the standard Legendrian trefoil knot in filled&#10;by a punctured torus). However, there are cases when duality holds even&#10;if is not simply-connected, for instance because of the existence of an&#10;auxiliary weight grading, see or for an example in the 1-dimensional&#10;case see . It is a very interesting open question to find a geometric&#10;characterization of when duality holds.&#10;&#10;As is well known, general constructions of Legendrian and Lagrangian&#10;holomorphic curve invariants require the use of so-called abstract&#10;perturbations. For our main invariant , all moduli spaces used can be&#10;shown to be transverse by classical techniques (see Theorem&#10;(\[thm:mdlitv\])) except for the rigid holomorphic planes in with a&#10;single positive end that are used to anchor the disks in the terminology&#10;of . (These are also relevant for defining the wrapped Floer cochain&#10;complex without Hamiltonian perturbations and for constructing the&#10;surgery map). In symplectic field theory similar transversality problems&#10;are dealt with by appealing to virtual perturbation techniques, see e.g.&#10;. Here we will not work out the details of this but merely assume such a&#10;perturbation scheme has been fixed. Our results are independent of the&#10;particular choice.&#10;&#10;We also point out that our construction of applies without reference to&#10;virtual techniques in a number of interesting cases where splitting off&#10;of holomorphic planes can be ruled out for topological reasons. For&#10;example, if there are no contractible Reeb orbits, e.g. for .">

If instead, we&#10;have an augmentation of , then we view as a right -module, and the&#10;-bimodule structure on would be given by ).&#10;&#10;Recall that for a unital -algebra over a field (or a semisimple ring&#10;such as ) any -module is both -projective and -injective, that is, if is&#10;an -module over and is an acyclic module over , then the complexes and&#10;are acyclic . Hence, the DG-algebra can be computed as the -module&#10;homomorphisms from to itself. (More generally, this holds if is&#10;-projective as a complex of - modules, which implies that is -projective&#10;as an -module over .) Therefore, we have the following.&#10;&#10;If (resp. ) is an augmented unital -algebra then&#10;&#10;Recall that is quasi-isomorphic to as an - module.

Let ,&#10;which is an augmented connected DG-algebra. Then and and are Koszul&#10;dual. In other words, the natural morphism is a quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;First, observe that indeed by . Next, we have that where we applied&#10;Lemma \[dualbar\] to and used the fact that since is locally finite.&#10;&#10;In the case that is a locally finite, connected (but not&#10;simply-connected) -bimodule, Lemma \[dualbar\] no longer applies. We&#10;instead use Lemma to deduce the following weaker duality result.&#10;&#10;\[almostdualbar\] Let be a connected, locally finite -bimodule, equipped&#10;with an coalgebra structure and coaugmentation , and , which is an&#10;augmented DG-algebra where augmentation is given by projection to .

Nevertheless, the duality&#10;result can still be proved in certain cases where an extra WEIGHT&#10;grading (internal degree, or Adams degree) is available (see , , ). We&#10;will not study this situation systematically in this paper, but it is&#10;important as it extends the range of applicability of Koszul duality&#10;theory.

We work over a field .&#10;&#10;Let denote the topological monoid of Moore loops based at , where the&#10;monoid structure comes from concatenation of loops (see ). Write for the&#10;cubical chain complex (graded cohomologically). Since is a topological&#10;monoid, the complex becomes a DG-algebra using the natural product map&#10;on cubical chains, where the DG-algebra product is given as follows: We&#10;point out that the -map when both sides are equipped with the Pontryagin&#10;product, is a DG-algebra map.&#10;&#10;In what follows, we shall also make use of an inverse to the , known as&#10;the Serre diagonal and the cubical analogue of the Alexander-Whitney&#10;map, To define this map consider the -cube with coordinates . For an&#10;ordered -element subset , , and for let be the map given in coordinates&#10;by Consider a cubical chain . If is an ordered subset of let denote its&#10;complement ordered in the natural way. Define by where the sum ranges&#10;over all ordered subsets and is the sign of the permutation . This is a&#10;strictly associative chain map inducing a quasi-isomorphism. Note also&#10;that there are obvious extensions of to several products of loop spaces.&#10;&#10;As the cubical chain complex is very large it is not the most effective&#10;complex for computation. We next discuss smaller models. Starting with a&#10;0-reduced simplicial set with geometric realization , an explicit&#10;economical model for is obtained by taking normalized chains on the Kan&#10;loop group . We will not say much about this, but point out that is a&#10;free simplicial group such that its geometric realization is homotopy&#10;equivalent to (cf. ). Hence, by the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence&#10;(cf. ) the normalized chains on gives a (weakly) equivalent model of .&#10;(Another similar construction is sketched in and leads to a free model.)&#10;&#10;Alternatively, one can work with CW complexes. We start with the simply&#10;connected case: for a -reduced (unique 0-cell and no 1-cells)&#10;CW-structure on the Adams-Hilton construction gives a free DG-algebra&#10;model for as follows. Denote the -cells of by , and . The Adams-Hilton&#10;construction gives a CW monoid with a single 0-cell and generating cells&#10;in dimension that is quasi-isomorphic to as a monoid (cf. ). This gives&#10;a DG-algebra structure on the free algebra: and a DG-algebra map which&#10;is a quasi-isomorphism. The differential on is generally not explicit.&#10;It is defined recursively as follows. For every 2-cell , we have . In&#10;general, assume that and have been defined on the -skeleton of , then&#10;for each -cell , with attaching map , define so that where a generator&#10;of , and to be the -chain of loops in (which then depends on earlier&#10;choices along the boundary of ). We remark that can be identified&#10;isomorphically with for a suitable coalgebra structure on the cellular&#10;chain complex .&#10;&#10;This construction can be generalized to the non-simply-connected case as&#10;follows. (See , a generalization was given earlier in , however that&#10;paper contains an error.) Begin with a -reduced CW-structure on . Denote&#10;the -cells by for . For each -cell with , we have a free variable in&#10;degree which we again denote by . For each -cell , we have two variables&#10;and in degree 0 such that . Thus, the underlying algebra is the “almost&#10;free” algebra of the form&#10;&#10;This presentation is often more efficient than the presentation one gets&#10;from the Kan loop group construction using a simplicial set presentation&#10;of . However, the differential in the Adams-Hilton model is not easy to&#10;describe explicitly. Note that we have for degree reasons. For every&#10;2-cell , we have where represents the class of the attaching map of .&#10;The differential on higher dimensional cells is generally harder to&#10;compute and is exactly as in the simply-connected case discussed above.&#10;&#10;Augmentations correspond to solutions of the equations Since is a&#10;presentation of the fundamental group algebra , augmentations correspond&#10;exactly to local systems .&#10;&#10;We will use the cubical chain complex to define Legendrian invariants&#10;below. Cubical chains work uniformly for all spaces and are convenient&#10;for showing that the fundamental classes of moduli spaces of&#10;pseudoholomorphic disks , via evaluation maps, take values in the chain&#10;complex. The Legendrian invariants can also be studied using any of the&#10;smaller models discussed above. It is however important to note that in&#10;the non-simply connected case, we only have either weak equivalence in&#10;the homotopy category of DG-algebras or Morita equivalence of these&#10;models and the cubical chain complex .&#10;&#10;In the case that is simply-connected we can use a DG-algebra map that&#10;goes in the opposite direction to the Adams-Hilton map to pass to a more&#10;economical quasi-isomorphic model. Such a homotopy equivalence is&#10;constructed in two steps: first, in using Eilenberg-Moore methods, a&#10;DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism: is constructed where in both instances&#10;refers to the normalised singular chains. Second, using the standard&#10;-coalgebra quasi-isomorphism between the DG-coalgebra of singular chains&#10;and the coalgebra of normalised cellular chains, one obtains a&#10;DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism since we assumed that the complexes and are&#10;simply-connected. (In Section \[CEsimplyconnected\], we also give a more&#10;geometric construction of a DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism using Morse&#10;flow trees.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, if is homotopy equivalent to an Eilenberg-Maclane space ,&#10;then the singular chains can be replaced with the group algebra : there&#10;exists a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras given by sending a -chain to&#10;its homology class, and sending all higher dimensional chains to 0. Note&#10;that this DG-algebra map exists for any space , but is a&#10;quasi-isomorphism only in the case that is homotopy equivalent to .&#10;&#10;It is often convenient to use a cofibrant (or free) replacement for .&#10;For example, if , then and a cofibrant replacement is given by the free&#10;graded algebra with the differential A DG-algebra defined over can be&#10;pulled back to a weakly equivalent DGA over this cofibrant replacement.&#10;(See for background in model categories on DG-algebras that we are using&#10;in a very simple case here.)">

The underlying algebra of the standard Chekanov-Eliashberg&#10;DG-algebra is generated freely by over . We need to modify this in the&#10;case is non-empty to incorporate chains in the based loop space of for .&#10;Let us first do this using cubical chains.&#10;&#10;For each , consider the cubical chains as a -algebra by requiring that&#10;the left or right action of is trivial except if when it acts as&#10;identity. Let be the algebra over given by freely adjoining elements of&#10;to the union of for . Thus an element of is a word in Reeb chords and&#10;chains on based loops of for that respects the -bimodule structure.&#10;&#10;Now the differential on is defined by extending the differential on the&#10;cubical complexes for . Since the elements of are added freely, it&#10;suffices to describe the differential on a single Reeb chord and extend&#10;it by the graded Leibniz rule. The differential on a Reeb chord&#10;decomposes to a sum where for any Reeb chord only finitely many are&#10;non-zero. The operations are defined as follows.&#10;&#10;Consider moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with positive puncture at ,&#10;see Section \[sec:mdlispaces\] for definitions and notation. More&#10;precisely, consider Reeb chords such that is a composable word and let .&#10;Consider the disk with one distinguished positive puncture and negative&#10;punctures (across which the boundary numbering is constant in the&#10;terminology of Section \[sec:mdlispaces\]). Consider the moduli space .&#10;Theorems \[thm:mdlitv\] and \[thm:mdlicmpct\] imply that this is a&#10;smooth orientable manifold with a natural compactification as a&#10;stratified space that carries a fundamental chain. It follows that, via&#10;the evaluation map at a point in the boundary arcs of , parameterizes a&#10;chain of paths in the -fold product , which after adding reference paths&#10;to the base point becomes chain of based loops in . We treat two cases&#10;separately. First, if all boundary components of map to components in&#10;then we let where is the algebraic number of -components in the moduli&#10;space. Second, if some boundary component maps to a component in then we&#10;write for the chain or paths in , where we separate the components in&#10;the product by the Reeb chords : where are the components of the&#10;fundamental chain . Further, we write for each boundary component that&#10;maps to a component in in between the Reeb chords as above.&#10;&#10;A subtle point here is that the moduli space naturally gives rise to a&#10;chain in the rather than . Note that are simply components of , they are&#10;not considered as chains. To separate these out we apply the cubical&#10;Alexander-Whitney map, recalled in Section \[Coefficients\]:&#10;&#10;With these conventions we then define for , where we separate the&#10;components of the tensor product by the Reeb chords in in analogy with&#10;the notation for the product chain and where is the Serre diagonal. The&#10;output of is thus a sum of alternating words of chains of loops in and&#10;Reeb chords, and is an operation of degree on . We point out that if&#10;there are components then higher dimensional moduli spaces contribute to&#10;the differential (unlike the case when ). Note also that it is possible&#10;to have holomorphic disks contributing to , which means that the chord&#10;is the positive puncture of a disk without negative punctures.&#10;&#10;Let be the map extended to by the graded Leibniz rule. Then is a&#10;differential, . We call with the differential the [**Chekanov-Eliashberg&#10;DG-algebra**]{}.&#10;&#10;When , was called in - this is cohomologically graded version of the&#10;usual Legendrian homology algebra in . By definition, we have .&#10;&#10;In case there are only components in involved the result follows from&#10;standard arguments involving the boundary of 1-dimensional moduli&#10;spaces. Consider therefore the case when there are chains in the loop&#10;space involved.&#10;&#10;Let . The -dimensional moduli space contributes to . Its boundary&#10;consists of broken curves with one level of dimension and one of&#10;dimension for , we find, with denoting the natural tensor extension of&#10;the boundary operator in singular homology over boundary components&#10;involved in , that where denotes the Pontryagin product, where , and .&#10;We next apply the cubical Alexander-Whitney map to this formula to&#10;deduce where we used that the is a chain map and is compatible with the&#10;product. The fact that is a chain map is well known. We verify that it&#10;is compatible with the product below. It follows that the terms&#10;contributing to which arises from the differential acting on chains and&#10;acting on Reeb chords cancel.&#10;&#10;It remains to check that is compatible with the products, to this end we&#10;provide the simplest non-trivial case, the general case is done&#10;similarly. Thus, we need to check that the following compositions agree:&#10;and This is easily checked by evaluating it on a test chain . Note that&#10;this uses the fact that the cubical chain complex is a quotient. Namely,&#10;degenerate cubical chains are divided out.&#10;&#10;\[r:topologicalversion\] As mentioned in the introduction we relate as&#10;defined above to a parallel copies version of the same algebra which is&#10;defined solely in terms of rigid moduli spaces. In order to do so it is&#10;convenient to use a topologically simpler but algebraically more&#10;complicated model of , defined as follows. The generating set of our&#10;algebra is extended to chains in the product , where we separate the&#10;coordinate functions by Reeb chords. We define the product of two such&#10;chains by taking the Pontryagin product of the chains at adjacent&#10;factors giving an operation The differential on this version of is then&#10;defined by the singular differential one the chain and as on Reeb chord&#10;generators. (In other words we define it as above but disregard the&#10;diagonal approximation.) It follows from the Künneth formula that the&#10;two versions of are quasi-isomorphic.&#10;&#10;Although, the definitions of given above works generally, from a&#10;computational perspective, it is hard to get our hands on, as the&#10;cubical chain complexes have uncountably many elements.&#10;&#10;Next, we provide a modification of the definition that gives a&#10;quasi-isomorphic DG-algebra, under the assumption that for each , there&#10;exists a DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism where is a DG-algebra structure on&#10;a free algebra generated by a graded finite set . For example, as&#10;discussed in Section \[Coefficients\], such a DG-algebra map exists when&#10;is simply-connected (or if is a space, one can first work with the group&#10;ring and base-change to a cofibrant replacement of it).&#10;&#10;We define a graded quiver with vertex set and arrows in correspondence&#10;with More precisely, there are arrows from vertex to corresponding to&#10;the set of Reeb chords from to . In addition, for each , there are&#10;arrows from to corresponding to the elements in . Let be the graded&#10;-bimodule generated by . Thus, there is one generator for each arrow in&#10;and an idempotent for each vertex and write for the submodule without&#10;the idempotents.&#10;&#10;Let be -algebra given by the tensor algebra Recall that the path algebra&#10;of a quiver is defined as a vector space having all paths in the quiver&#10;as basis (including, for each vertex an idempotent ), and multiplication&#10;given by concatenation of paths. Thus, the -bimodule is the path algebra&#10;of the quiver where the grading of each arrow is shifted up by . Just&#10;like in the cobar construction we write elements in as where .&#10;&#10;Next, we equip the -algebra with a differential using the moduli spaces&#10;of holomorphic disks defined in Section \[sec:mdlispaces\]. This&#10;differential is induced by operations where , that give the structure of&#10;an coalgebra if .&#10;&#10;Consider a generator of . If it is a generator of the free model of for&#10;some component then we define where is the co-product that corresponds&#10;to homogeneous piece of the differential in the free model of . If it is&#10;a Reeb chord the define as before using moduli spaces but now take the&#10;image of all the singular chains in under the map . Since the map is a&#10;DG-algebra map, the proof that is differential on is the same.&#10;Furthermore, since is a quasi-isomorphism, we get a quasi-isomorphic&#10;chain complex if we use coefficients instead of .&#10;&#10;From now on, unless otherwise specified, we will always assume that we&#10;work with a free (over ) model of .&#10;&#10;If there exists an augmentation , then there is a change of coordinates&#10;which turn into a coalgebra. More precisely, consider the restriction of&#10;, , where we think of as the degree polynomials in . Define Note that is&#10;generated idempotents and by , where ranges over the generators of . Let&#10;be the -algebra automorphism defined on generators as . Define the&#10;operations by&#10;&#10;\[noncurved\] The operations satisfy the -coalgebra relations and with&#10;these operations is a coaugmented conilpotent coalgebra.&#10;&#10;Let denote the differential on and let be a generator of . Since is a&#10;augmentation, and it follows that . The coalgebra relations then follows&#10;by combining the equation from Theorem \[noncurved\] with the&#10;automorphism .&#10;&#10;The coaugmentation is simply the inclusion of . The fact that is&#10;conilpotent follows from Stokes’ theorem: the sum of the actions of the&#10;Reeb chords at the negative end of a disk contributing to the&#10;differential is bounded above by the action of the Reeb chord at the&#10;positive end. This gives the desired finiteness.&#10;&#10;Note that if the original operation on equals then the map which takes&#10;all generators of to is an augmentation and in this case by&#10;construction.&#10;&#10;If there is an augmentation then can be expressed as the cobar&#10;construction of a coalgebra: by construction&#10;&#10;We next consider the -linear dual of . It follows from Section&#10;\[ssec:gradeddual\] that this is an augmented -algebra. We call it the&#10;LEGENDRIAN -ALGEBRA.&#10;&#10;In case , it can be shown that this algebra can be obtained from the&#10;endomorphism algebra of the augmentation in category of by adjoining a&#10;unit to it, but is, in general, different from the endomorphism algebra&#10;in the category of .&#10;&#10;Given an augmentation , we define the [**completed Chekanov-Eliashberg&#10;DG-algebra**]{} to be . The underlying -algebra is the completed tensor&#10;algebra: where is the ideal determined by the natural augmentation.&#10;&#10;Note that there is a natural chain map:&#10;&#10;\[spherecon\] To illustrate the various gradings, the unique Reeb chord&#10;for the standard Legendrian unknot in has degree is in , in and in&#10;(while it is in ). Therefore, we have the graded isomorphisms: , and .">

For exact&#10;Lagrangian submanifolds with Legendrian boundary we get an induced&#10;perturbation scheme for the Legendrian boundary that will allow us to&#10;define a simpler version of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra which is&#10;isomorphic to it in case the Legendrian is simply connected.&#10;&#10;Let be a Weinstein manifold and let be an exact Lagrangian submanifold&#10;with Legendrian boundary .

  <outline text="Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra with parallel copies" _note="We will relate the Legendrian invariants and to Floer (co)homology of&#10;exact Lagrangian submanifolds. When studying Lagrangian Floer&#10;(co)homology we employ the technique of parallel copies to achieve&#10;transversality and it will be convenient to express the Legendrian&#10;invariants in the same language. As it turns out, in the case that the&#10;Legendrians are simply connected this technique leads to a simpler&#10;formulation of the theory which incorporates a model of chains on the&#10;based loop space automatically. Recall that Lagrangian fillings of&#10;Legendrian submanifolds induce augmentations, which after change of&#10;variables lead to non-curved Legendrian co-algebras. Geometrically, this&#10;means that one uses anchored holomorphic disks. We will assume that an&#10;augmentation of has been fixed in this section and all disks considered&#10;will be anchored with respect to this augmentation. We now turn to the&#10;description of this theory in the Legendrian setting.&#10;&#10;Let be as above with decomposition . Fix a Morse function which is&#10;positive on and negative on . Use it as described in Section&#10;\[sec:parallel\] to construct a system of parallel copies of .&#10;&#10;Let , , and be as above. Let denote the Reeb chords connecting to that&#10;lie in a small neighborhood of . By construction there is then a natural&#10;1-1 correspondence between and the set of critical points of on . (Since&#10;shifts in the negative Reeb direction there are no such short chords&#10;near .) Write and think of chords in as connecting a component to&#10;itself. Again the set is a graded set: Reeb chords are graded as above&#10;and the grading of a short chord equals the negative of the Morse index&#10;of the critical point of corresponding to .&#10;&#10;We define a graded quiver with vertex set and arrows in correspondence&#10;with More precisely, there are arrows from vertex to corresponding to&#10;the set of Reeb chords from to if and corresponding to short Reeb chords&#10;from to if .&#10;&#10;Let be the graded -bimodule generated by . We define an coalgebra&#10;structure on given by operations as follows. Given a chord (input) and a&#10;chords (outputs), we consider the disk with distinguished puncture at&#10;and an STRICTLY INCREASING boundary decoration . Let . Consider the&#10;moduli space . We write for the algebraic number of -components in this&#10;moduli space provided and otherwise. Define for , where . This gives an&#10;operation of degree on . Note that trivially, since the decoration is&#10;strictly increasing.&#10;&#10;It is not a priori clear that the maps are well-defined as the sum may&#10;involve infinitely many terms. This can be avoided easily if are&#10;simply-connected for . Namely, the simply-connectedness of guarantees&#10;that the short chords cost index, whereas the long chords cost energy.&#10;In the non-simply connected case, we will only consider a completed&#10;version of where infinite expressions are allowed.&#10;&#10;Suppose is simply-connected or more generally, suppose that factorizes&#10;through the natural inclusion for all , then equipped with the&#10;operations is an coalgebra.&#10;&#10;Recall that the moduli spaces involved in the definition of the&#10;operations are moduli spaces of anchored disks, where we use the&#10;augmentation induced by the filling . Consider a 1-dimensional moduli&#10;space and note that its boundary consists of two level rigid disks by&#10;Theorems \[thm:mdlicmpct\] and \[thm:mdlitv\]. There are two cases,&#10;either the levels are joined at a chord connecting the same copy of to&#10;itself or the chord connects distinct copies. Since we count anchored&#10;disks and since the augmentation satisfies the chain map equation, the&#10;first type of breaking cancels algebraically. Theorem \[thm:mdlicopies\]&#10;then shows that there are canonical identifications between moduli&#10;spaces for different increasing numberings and the proof follows since&#10;the second type of breakings are exactly what contributes to the&#10;coalgebra relations and are then in algebraic one to one correspondence&#10;with the endpoints of an oriented compact 1-manifold.&#10;&#10;We next introduce the parallel copies version of the Chekanov-Eliashberg&#10;algebra. Consider a generator of which is a small Reeb chord that&#10;corresponds to a critical point of the Morse function . The coalgebra&#10;operations then counts holomorphic disks with positive puncture at&#10;which, by an action argument, must lie in a small neighborhood of . In&#10;particular, rigid such holomorphic disks are in natural correspondence&#10;with rigid Morse flow trees. It follows from this that if is the minimum&#10;of the Morse function on the component then , , and for . Furthermore,&#10;if is any other generator corresponding to an arrow from to then and&#10;does not contain any factor for . The equations involving only follows&#10;by the description of flow trees emanating from a minimum, the other&#10;equations follows from the fact that any rigid disk with an output&#10;puncture at the minimum must correspond to a flow line attached to a&#10;trivial strip, for dimensional reasons. It then follows that there is a&#10;coaugmentation&#10;&#10;If is simply-connected, the parallel copies Chekanov-Eliashberg&#10;DG-algebra is If is not simply-connected, then we define the completed&#10;DG-algebra with the differential induced from the operations .&#10;&#10;As in the case with loop space coefficients we also define the&#10;Legendrian -algebra of as the linear dual of the Legendrian co-algebra:&#10;Note that since there is no finiteness condition necessary for , this is&#10;well-defined for all without any need to complete.">

  <outline text="Isomorphism between Chekanov-Eliashberg algebras in the simply connected case" _note="We next show that if is simply connected then is in fact isomorphic to .&#10;To this end we first establish a Morse theoretic version of Adams result&#10;mentioned in the introduction, which here corresponds to the purely&#10;local situation of the zero-section in a 1-jet space.&#10;&#10;Let be a SIMPLY-CONNECTED smooth manifold with a base point . Fix a&#10;system of positive Morse functions , and assume that the functions have&#10;only one minimum and no index one critical points. (This can always be&#10;arranged by handle cancellation if , see Remarks \[r:dim4\] and&#10;\[r:dim4iso\] for the lower dimensional case.) We will first discuss a&#10;Morse flow tree model for chains on that we denote . Our treatment of&#10;Morse flow trees follows .&#10;&#10;Consider a strip or half-strip with coordinates and with slits along , ,&#10;and in the half-strip case. In the half strip case the vertical segment&#10;is a finite end that will be an used as an input, and we do not consider&#10;it as a part of the boundary of the strip with slits. In the strip case,&#10;the input is at the puncture , and in both cases we call punctures at&#10;output. Order the boundary components according to the positive boundary&#10;orientation of the disk with punctures starting from the input and&#10;decorate its boundary components by a strictly increasing sequence of&#10;positive integers . Let denote this decoration. Cutting the strip by&#10;line segments , , subdivides it into STRIP REGIONS of the form , where ,&#10;, and and with a numbering on each boundary component and .&#10;&#10;A flow tree is a continuous map from a strip with slits into which in&#10;each strip region depends only on the first coordinate and there&#10;satisfies the gradient equation where is the numbering of the upper&#10;horizontal boundary of the strip region and that of the lower.&#10;&#10;A partial flow tree is defined analogously except that the domain is a&#10;half-strip with slits .&#10;&#10;If is a critical point of then we let denote the negative Morse index of&#10;. If is a word of critical points of then the space of flow trees with&#10;input puncture at and output punctures , in the order induced by the&#10;boundary orientation, has dimension For sufficiently small perturbing&#10;system of Morse functions , the space of flow trees is independent of&#10;the increasing boundary decoration . Let denote the -module generated by&#10;critical points of and equip with the structure of a coalgebra with&#10;operations given by where the sum ranges over all of word length . It is&#10;not hard to see that the boundary of a 1-dimensional space of flow trees&#10;consists of broken rigid flow trees from which it follows that the&#10;operations satisfy the coalgebra relations. Furthermore, the coalgebra&#10;has a natural co-unit, the critical point which is the minimum of . We&#10;will call this critical point the CO-UNIT CRITICAL POINT. We say that a&#10;flow tree with no puncture mapping to the co-unit critical point is&#10;CO-UNIT FREE.&#10;&#10;The coalgebra is in fact known to agree with the Floer coalgebra , where&#10;we view as the zero section in its own cotangent bundle as follows. Let&#10;be the system of parallel copies of the -section corresponding to the&#10;system of functions . Then by a special case of (the case when fronts&#10;have no singularities at all), there is, for all sufficiently small&#10;shifts, a natural one to one correspondence between rigid holomorphic&#10;disks with boundary on and Morse flow trees in determined by . This&#10;gives a chain isomorphism .&#10;&#10;We now return to the Morse theoretic approach to Adams’ result. We will&#10;define a map in terms of the operation of attaching co-unit free partial&#10;flow trees to Moore loops , , based at , parameterized by a simplex, .&#10;To define this operation we will use the following notion: we say that a&#10;partial flow tree parameterized by a half-strip starts at a point if its&#10;input puncture maps to , .&#10;&#10;(-5,-1) to (0,-1); (-5,2) to (0,2); (0,0) to (-1,0); (0,1) to (-2,1);&#10;&#10;(-5,3) to (0,3); (-5,5) to (0,5); (0,4) to (-1.5,4);&#10;&#10;(-5,6) to (0,6); (-5,8) to (0,8); (0,7) to (-2,7);&#10;&#10;(-5,2) to (-5,3); (-5,5) to (-5,6);&#10;&#10;(-5, -1) to\[in=135,out=225\] (-5,8); at (-5.5,0.5) ; at (-5.5,4) ; at&#10;(-5.5,7) ;&#10;&#10;at (0.4,-1) []{}; at (0.4,2) []{}; at (0.4,0) []{}; at (0.4,1) []{};&#10;&#10;at (0.4,3) []{}; at (0.4,5) []{}; at (0.4,4) []{}; at (0.4,6) []{}; at&#10;(0.4,8) []{}; at (0.4,7) []{};&#10;&#10;Attaching partial flow trees to then means fixing points and partial&#10;flow trees , that start at . Our map takes values in and will&#10;accordingly be defined by attaching flow trees which have no output at&#10;the co-unit. Note that the set of positive punctures of minimum free&#10;partial flow trees for a fixed decreasing boundary numbering constitutes&#10;a codimension two subset in and that the corresponding subset for any&#10;numbering lies in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of it. Choosing the&#10;Morse data generically means in particular that the base point does not&#10;lie on any minimum free partial flow tree.&#10;&#10;If is a loop with flow trees attached at , we also introduce a numbering&#10;of the components of induced by the flow trees attached as follows. The&#10;right most interval is numbered by . The right boundary segment of the&#10;strip with slits attached at is numbered by as well, whereas the left&#10;boundary segment of its domain is numbered by . We number the boundary&#10;segment and the right boundary segment of the domain of the flow tree&#10;attached at by as well. The left boundary segment of the flow tree&#10;attached at is then numbered by , which determines the numbering of the&#10;segment as well as the right boundary segment in the flow tree at , etc.&#10;We view the end result of this process as the domain for a loop with&#10;flow trees attached with numbering that decreases, see Figure&#10;\[adamsmap\].&#10;&#10;Note next that if is a -dimensional cube in general position with&#10;respect to , the set of , for which a single partial flow tree can be&#10;attached is at most -dimensional. Attaching more partial flow trees, the&#10;dimension decreases further, by at least one for each flow tree. We say&#10;that the loops in with flow trees attached which form -dimensional&#10;family are the rigid loops with flow trees in . If is a cubical simplex&#10;in and if is a word of critical points then we let denote the space of&#10;loops with flow trees in , where the critical points at punctures of the&#10;flow trees read in order give the word . The dimension of is then where&#10;is the word length.&#10;&#10;Note that if the set of loops in with flow trees is transversely cut out&#10;then by definition of the system of perturbing Morse functions, the&#10;loops with flow trees corresponding to a different decreasing numbering&#10;is canonically diffeomorphic to that corresponding . We define the map&#10;by counting rigid loops with flow trees in cubical simplices :&#10;&#10;The map is defined only for chains that are suitably transverse to the&#10;Morse flow trees defined by the system of shifting functions . Since the&#10;Morse functions do not have any index one critical points a partial flow&#10;tree has at most punctures. There is a natural evaluation map on partial&#10;flow trees that takes a flow tree to the location of its positive&#10;puncture. The image of this map for partial flow trees not involving the&#10;minimum is a stratified space of codimension one and by definition of&#10;the perturbation scheme the corresponding set for partial flow trees&#10;defined by distinct boundary numberings lie arbitrarily close to each&#10;other. The map above is defined for chains of loops with evaluation maps&#10;that are smooth and transverse to this stratified subset. It is&#10;straightforward to see that any chain of loops is homotopic to such a&#10;transverse chain and that any two transverse chains that are homologous&#10;are homologous through a transverse chain of loops. This means that we&#10;can replace all chains by chains that represent these transversality&#10;conditions.&#10;&#10;In order to connect this to the path loop fibration we consider a&#10;similar map where denotes the canonical twisting cochain of the cobar&#10;construction and the based path space. The map again counts rigid paths&#10;with flow trees, where a path with flow trees is defined as a loop with&#10;flow trees except that we also attach a flow tree at the endpoint of the&#10;path. Furthermore, the last puncture in the flow tree attached at the&#10;endpoint is the distinguished last factor and is allowed to be the&#10;co-unit critical point. (Other punctures are still not the co-unit&#10;critical point, which means that flow trees before the last are still&#10;co-unit free and that in the last flow tree only the last puncture is&#10;allowed to be the co-unit). We point out that the differential on the&#10;twisted complex acting on the last factor in the right hand side counts&#10;trees where the last puncture is distinguished.&#10;&#10;The maps and are chain maps.&#10;&#10;To see this note that the contributions to the chain map equation in&#10;both cases correspond to the boundary of an oriented compact&#10;1-dimensional manifold.&#10;&#10;The codimension one boundary of corresponds either to the loop or path&#10;moving to the boundary of or to the breaking of a flow tree at a&#10;critical point. Instances when two trees are attached at the same point&#10;are naturally interior points of the moduli space where the disks with&#10;slits joins to a new disk with a slit of width equal to the sum of the&#10;widths.

To see that,&#10;note that for each critical point there is a unique flow tree with&#10;positive puncture and two negative punctures, one at the co-unit and one&#10;at . Filtering by degree we find that this is the only part of the&#10;differential which contributes to the differential on the first page of&#10;the corresponding spectral sequence. Since it gives an isomorphism from&#10;words not ending with the co-unit to those which does end with , the&#10;desired acyclicity follows. Clearly, is also acyclic.&#10;&#10;Note next that the map respects the filtration by degree at the end&#10;point. The corresponding -terms with induced maps are and -terms&#10;Zeeman’s comparison theorem then establishes the result.&#10;&#10;\[r:dim4\] If then the Morse function may have critical points of index&#10;one. In this case we use stabilization as follows. Multiply by for any ,&#10;and consider the function , then has the same critical points as and is&#10;inward point at infinity. In there is room to cancel 1-handles and the&#10;above applies. In this case we define to be (which is a 1-reduced&#10;version of the original complex). Noting that and are canonically&#10;isomorphic the result follows also in this case.&#10;&#10;We next show that and are isomorphic if is simply connected. This is a&#10;more or less direct consequence of the description of rigid disks on a&#10;Legendrian with parallel copies and the isomorphism in Theorem&#10;\[thm:Adams\]. Since components in are not affected by this choice of&#10;versus , we disregard them and assume that in what follows.&#10;&#10;Recall the definition of given in Remark \[r:topologicalversion\],&#10;generated by chains in the product of the based loop space of with&#10;factors separated by Reeb chords. Here the differential of a chain in&#10;the product of the based loop space of with factors separated by Reeb&#10;chords. Here the differential of a chain is just the usual differential&#10;of the chain whereas the differential of a Reeb chord is a sum over all&#10;moduli spaces of disks with one positive puncture at the chord and any&#10;number of negative punctures. Such a moduli space carries a fundamental&#10;chain and the contribution to the differential is alternating word of&#10;chains in the based loop space corresponding to the boundary arcs of the&#10;disk carried by the fundamental chain and Reeb chords at the negative&#10;puncture: where and is a word of Reeb chords.&#10;&#10;We next consider a system of parallel copies defined by a system of&#10;positive Morse functions , where . Recall that the generators of the&#10;algebra are the Reeb chords connecting to , and that these are long,&#10;corresponding to Reeb chords of and short, corresponding to critical&#10;points of , except for the minimum. The differential counts rigid disks&#10;with one positive puncture in where is a decreasing boundary numbering,&#10;.&#10;&#10;If is a word of Reeb chords let denote the word obtained by removing all&#10;short Reeb chords and that obtained by removing all long Reeb chords.&#10;Let denote the system of parallel copies defined by the system .&#10;&#10;\[t:quantumflowtree\] For all sufficiently small there is a natural one&#10;to one correspondence between rigid holomorphic disks with one positive&#10;puncture in and rigid configurations of a holomorphic disk with boundary&#10;on in with partial flow trees attached along the boundary, where the&#10;partial flow trees have negative punctures corresponding to and such&#10;that the total word of negative asymptotics is .&#10;&#10;This was proved in the setting of knot contact homology in and in the&#10;case when there is only one flow line attached in . The proof has three&#10;parts, convergence, gluing, and surjectivity of gluing. All relevant&#10;technicalities in this more general case can be handled as there.&#10;&#10;We next consider the map which takes every Reeb chord to itself and&#10;takes a chain in the based loop space to , where is as in and where we&#10;identify the critical points of with the corresponding Reeb chords&#10;connecting to .&#10;&#10;\[t:parallel=loops\] The map is a DG-algebra map and if is simply&#10;connected then is a quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;The fact that is a chain map follows from Theorem \[t:quantumflowtree\].&#10;Filter the algebras by action of Reeb chords in the left hand side and&#10;actions of long Reeb chords in the right hand side. The map respects&#10;this filtration and gives an isomorphism on the -pages by Theorem&#10;\[thm:Adams\]. Since the sum actions of the Reeb chords at the negative&#10;end is bounded by that at the positive the spectral sequences converges.&#10;The theorem follows.&#10;&#10;\[r:dim4iso\] Note that the isomorphism in Theorem \[t:parallel=loops\]&#10;is compatible with the stabilization of Remark \[r:dim4\]. To see this&#10;we multiply the ambient contact manifold with contact form by and&#10;consider with contact form . The Reeb chord of then come in -families,&#10;one for each Reeb chord of . Consider the contact form and note that&#10;with respect to this contact form the Reeb chords of are in natural one&#10;to one correspondence with those of and there is a canonical isomorphism&#10;between and . In fact the disks in the differential are canonically&#10;identified. It follows in particular, that Theorem \[t:parallel=loops\]&#10;holds also if .">

To begin with, let&#10;us first assume that is an embedded Lagrangian. Since has boundary, in&#10;classical topology, one can consider either or . In our case, these two&#10;choices are reflected in the choices of or decorations on ,&#10;respectively. More generally, let , be the (irreducible) components of .&#10;As with the Legendrian submanifolds in Section \[ssec:Leginv\], we&#10;assume these components of are decorated by signs and we write for the&#10;corresponding decomposition.

Define the operations by where denotes the word length of and&#10;where denotes the algebraic number of points in the oriented&#10;0-dimensional manifold.&#10;&#10;The operations satisfy the -algebra relations.&#10;&#10;This follows by the usual argument: after noting that the decreasing&#10;boundary numbering ensures that there is no boundary bubbling, one&#10;observes that the terms in the -algebra relations count the ends of a&#10;1-dimensional oriented compact manifold by Theorems \[thm:mdlitv\] and&#10;\[thm:mdlicmpct\].

Note that there is&#10;an idempotent on each component corresponding to the minimum of the&#10;shifting Morse function, which is increasing at infinity since we shift&#10;in the positive Reeb direction. We write for the sum of over all&#10;components in . We write for the augmented algebra where we adjoined an&#10;idempotent for each component .

All our&#10;constructions should extend meaningfully to this more general setting&#10;but we have not pursued this direction in this paper.&#10;&#10;We next consider various linear duals of and associated algebraic&#10;objects. The simplest case occurs when is simply connected. In this case&#10;the linear dual is a coalgebra with operations dual to , and as before&#10;we can adjoin so that is co-augmented over .

Recall that there exists a strict idempotent for each&#10;corresponding to the minimum of the shifting Morse function and that we&#10;make unital by adding an idempotent for each . We write the strictly&#10;unital algebra . Let be the augmentation that maps to for and to for .&#10;Consider the dual of the bar construction: or in other words the&#10;completed Adams-Floer DG-algebra. In what follows it will be useful to&#10;represent as a quotient. Consider adding extra idempotents , to . This&#10;gives and we equip it with the trivial augmentation which is the&#10;projection to . Let and let denote the subalgebra of generated by all&#10;monomials that contains a dual of for some .

The fact that is a chain map follows&#10;from the being strict idempotents.&#10;&#10;We next define a map which will induce a twisting co-chain The map is&#10;defined by the following curve count for generators of .

The first equation follows.&#10;&#10;To see the twisting co-chain equation, we need to check that where , and&#10;. To this end, we consider the boundary of the -dimensional moduli space&#10;.

The following theorem gives a sufficient&#10;condition for to be Koszul:&#10;&#10;\[mainthm\] Suppose that is locally finite, simply-connected -bimodule.&#10;Suppose, in addition, that , then is quasi-isomorphic to and is a Koszul&#10;twisted cochain. In other words, the induced DG-algebra map: is a&#10;quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;\[cor:CE=loopspace\] In the situation of Theorem \[mainthm\], suppose&#10;that is connected and decorated by and that is diffeomorphic to a sphere&#10;. Writing , there exists a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras where is the&#10;based loop space of .&#10;&#10;We first note that there exists a quasi-isomorphism since is an exact&#10;Lagrangian. We next use Theorem \[mainthm\] and Adams’ cobar equivalence&#10;(): which holds for the simply-connected topological space .&#10;&#10;Theorem \[mainthm\] is obtained as a corollary of Theorem \[doubledual\]&#10;and the following result:&#10;&#10;\[ainfiso\] Suppose that . Then, there exists a quasi-isomorphism of&#10;augmented -algebras: such that&#10;&#10;Note that if is subcritical, or more generally a flexible Weinstein&#10;manifold.&#10;&#10;We construct an functor where are constructed by dualizing the&#10;components of the map . More explicitly, given and , write as in , and&#10;define The proof that is an functor follows as in the proof of&#10;Proposition \[twch\].&#10;&#10;Now, we need to check that is a quasi-isomorphism. In the case that ,&#10;this is a consequence of the exact sequence for wrapped Floer cohomology&#10;induced by the subdivision of the complex into high and low energy&#10;generators: as follows. In terms of the version of wrapped Floer&#10;cohomology presented in Section \[sec:wrappediso\], the low energy&#10;sub-complex is generated by Lagrangian intersection points in , where&#10;and is the first parallel copy of , shifted by a positive Morse function&#10;that increases in the end, see Section \[sec:parallel\]. The&#10;differential on counts holomorphic strips which is incoming along and&#10;outgoing along at the output puncture. Similarly, the high energy&#10;quotient is generated by Reeb chords connecting to , the differential&#10;counts holomorphic strips interpolating between such Reeb chords. Since&#10;is acyclic it follows that the connecting homomorphism is an&#10;isomorphism. In order to connect this to and , renumber the parallel&#10;copies so that now lies in the negative Reeb direction of at infinity&#10;and the shifting function is replaced by . Then note that since is&#10;labeled by the following holds.&#10;&#10;The linear dual of is canonically identified with as a chain complex&#10;(Note that also has an coalgebra structure as defined in and this should&#10;dualize to the algebra structure on but we do not need that here).&#10;&#10;The linear dual of is canonically identified with as a chain complex.&#10;&#10;The linear dual of the connecting homomorphism can be canonically&#10;identified with the map on critical points that counts strips with an&#10;input puncture at and output puncture at a Reeb chord and is the&#10;canonical map on .&#10;&#10;Since the connecting homomorphism is an isomorphism so is its linear&#10;dual. (The argument here is originally due to Seidel, compare .)&#10;&#10;In the case that the argument just given applies after certain&#10;deformation that we describe next. For components in , and are defined&#10;via parallel copies shifted in the positive Reeb direction at infinity.&#10;To connect to the previous case we consider a Lagrangian cobordism of&#10;two cylinders which is constant and which is the trace of an isotopy&#10;pushing across in the negative Reeb direction. Then the intersection&#10;points of the two cylinders are in natural 1-1 correspondence between&#10;the short Reeb chords between and . Furthermore, it is straightforward&#10;to show that there is exactly one transverse holomorphic strip&#10;connecting each intersection point to the corresponding Reeb chord at&#10;the negative end of the cobordism.&#10;&#10;Adding these cylinders to we get a 1-parameter family of pairs of&#10;Lagrangian submanifolds and , where is a gluing parameter that measures&#10;the length of the trivial cobordism between and the added cylinders. The&#10;wrapped Floer cohomology is acyclic and is generated by the set of long&#10;Reeb chords from to , the set of intersection points between the&#10;cylinders, and intersection points in . Let denote the short Reeb chords&#10;connecting to and recall the natural 1-1 correspondence above. Let be We&#10;claim that the following sets are in natural 1-1 correspondence for all&#10;sufficiently large :&#10;&#10;Rigid strips of and with input puncture at and output puncture at .&#10;&#10;Rigid strips of with input puncture at and output puncture at and rigid&#10;strips of with input puncture in and output puncture at .&#10;&#10;Rigid strips of with input puncture at and output puncture at and rigid&#10;strips of with input puncture at and positive puncture at .&#10;&#10;To see this note first that the strips in are unaffected by adding the&#10;almost trivial cobordism. For , in the limit the disks limits to an&#10;anchored disk with a positive puncture and a puncture at the&#10;intersection point. Gluing the basic strip connecting the intersection&#10;point to the short Reeb chord to it gives a 1-dimensional moduli space.&#10;The other boundary component of this moduli space consists of a rigid&#10;strip in the cobordism and a disk of dimension one in either&#10;symplectization end. Since the only rigid strips in the cobordism with&#10;negative ends at Reeb chords are either close to trivial strips or a&#10;basic strip it follows that the other end must be a trivial strip&#10;followed by a strip connecting to in the negative symplectization end.&#10;For we note that every rigid strip must break under stretching into two&#10;rigid strips. Since the only rigid strips in the upper part are the&#10;basic strips the claim follows.&#10;&#10;Observe that the strips in and contribute to and the strips in to the&#10;differential on . The vanishing of the wrapped Floer cohomology of then&#10;implies that is a quasi-isomorphism. The last statement follows from&#10;Proposition \[twch\].&#10;&#10;[(OF THEOREM \[MAINTHM\])]{} Note that the quasi-isomorphism given in&#10;Theorem \[ainfiso\] induces a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras by an&#10;application of with respect to length filtrations on the bar&#10;construction.&#10;&#10;By the locally finiteness and simply-connectedness assumptions, each of&#10;these bar constructions are locally finite. So, we can apply the linear&#10;dual operation to get a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras: The result&#10;then follows as in Theorem \[doubledual\] where locally finiteness of&#10;the grading enabled us to appeal to Lemma \[dualbar\]. Therefore, the&#10;quasi-isomorphism given in induces the quasi-isomorphism: as required.&#10;&#10;Note that the algebras and are finite rank -bimodules (in particular,&#10;they are locally finite), thus we can consider their -duals which are,&#10;by definition, the -coalgebras and . However, unless we have the&#10;simply-connectedness assumption, the quasi-isomorphism does not&#10;necessarily dualize to an -comap because comaps are required to&#10;factorize through inclusion of the corresponding direct sum into the&#10;direct product as in . This is to ensure that -coalgebra maps induces a&#10;DG-algebra map on the cobar construction. If we drop this condition, we&#10;can observe that the -quasi isomorphism dualizes to DG-algebra map and&#10;this is just the map induced by the twisting cochain .&#10;&#10;By the universal property of completion, this induces a DG-algebra map&#10;&#10;Now, since is a quasi-isomorphism, by using the length filtration on ,&#10;and appealing to , we can conclude the following.&#10;&#10;\[comple\] Suppose that , then there exists a quasi-isomorphism of&#10;DG-algebras&#10;&#10;Note that the completion is in general a cruder invariant than both and&#10;. Though, we always have a map Theorem \[comple\] can be used to compute&#10;in a variety of cases. For example, if is connected Lagrangian filling&#10;decorated by of a Legendrian which is diffeomorphic to a sphere , then&#10;writing , then we have a quasi-isomorphism since is an exact Lagrangian.&#10;Hence, we have a map Here the right hand side can often be computed, in&#10;particular is the group ring of the unipotent completion of the&#10;fundamental group (cf. ).&#10;&#10;In particular, any information on the completion map can help to obtain&#10;information about . We will see an application of this idea in the next&#10;section.&#10;&#10;We end this section with a discussion of the twisting cochains&#10;constructed above from an after surgery perspective. Assume that all&#10;components of are spheres and recall the surgery isomorphism of&#10;Conjecture \[appconj\]. Let , where is the identity map on components in&#10;and the map of Theorem \[t:parallel=loops\]. We next note that there is&#10;a natural -algebra map where we identify with the Floer cohomology of&#10;the manifold after surgery obtained by capping off all boundary spheres&#10;in by disks. (Note that the shifting Morse function then extends with a&#10;unique minimum in each disk which gives an idempotent corresponding to&#10;.)&#10;&#10;The map is defined by a curve count. Fix systems of parallel copies of&#10;and of . Let be a word of Reeb chords of and let be a word of&#10;intersection points of . Let and define&#10;&#10;\[r:inducednegparallel\] We require here that the parallel copies give a&#10;system of parallel copies of near the surgery region such that for the&#10;components of labeled by (resp. ) the induced parallel copies lies in&#10;the negative (resp. positive) Reeb direction. Compare Figure&#10;\[intersectiongen\].&#10;&#10;The map is a map of -algebras and , where is the strict unit in and is&#10;the dual of the unit in if and the unit in if .&#10;&#10;This follows as usual by identifying terms contributing to the&#10;-relations with the oriented boundary of an oriented 1-manifold and&#10;Theorems \[thm:mdlitv\], \[thm:mdlicmpct\], \[thm:mdlicopies\].&#10;&#10;To compute note that we can represent as the minimum of the shifting&#10;Morse function of and note that there is a unique flow line from this&#10;minimum to the intersection point and a unique flow line in from the&#10;intersection point to the minimum in . The corresponding holomorphic&#10;disk starts at the intersection point between and , has two corners at&#10;and , and ends at the intersection point in corresponding to the minimum&#10;of the shifting Morse function.&#10;&#10;The pre-twisting cochain can now be seen to arise via SFT-stretching as&#10;follows. Consider the first component of the -map above and a&#10;holomorphic disk contributing to it. Now stretch the lower end of the&#10;cobordism. Then by SFT-compactness the curves contributing to breaks up&#10;into a curve contributing to the map followed by the twisting cochain at&#10;each negative puncture. Noting that are the only low energy generators,&#10;it follows that the map induces a map of the high energy quotient into&#10;and we can write the induced map as .">

As explained we cannot directly calculate the&#10;twisting cochain into the Legendrian coalgebra with coefficients in&#10;chains of the based loop space. We can however calculate the&#10;corresponding twisting cochain when we replace chains on the based loop&#10;space with the Morse theory of parallel copies for the components&#10;decorated by a positive sign. To carry out the calculation we pick a&#10;Morse function on the component with on minimum and a maximum . We place&#10;them on the circle and choose parallel copies as shown in Figure&#10;\[hopfparallel\]. The parallel copies algebra is where we use notation&#10;for Reeb chords and Floer cohomology generators as in Section&#10;\[ssec:Hopflink\]. The differential is Passing to means dividing out by&#10;the cokernel of the coaugmentation that takes to . This gives the&#10;algebra and the differential becomes&#10;&#10;The twisting cochain is induced from a map that counts holomorphic disks&#10;with one positive puncture and boundary on , and with several punctures&#10;at Lagrangian intersection points in the compact part, see . In the&#10;current example it is straightforward to find these disk. Note first&#10;that by general properties, see Proposition \[twch\], where is the&#10;idempotent corresponding to the minimum of the shifting Morse function&#10;on .

We find that&#10;&#10;The space give further information of the twisting co-chain as follows.&#10;Note that as the evaluation map hits the double point one can glue on a&#10;constant disk. These broken disks are also the boundary of the&#10;1-dimensional moduli spaces and . The other end of these moduli spaces&#10;correspond to broken disks with one level in the symplectization, a disk&#10;in in the former case and in in the latter, and two disks one in and one&#10;in attached at its negative end.

Pick a handle decomposition of without - and&#10;-handles. The existence of such a handle decomposition is equivalent to&#10;simply-connectivity in high dimensions by the work of Smale. Consider&#10;the corresponding Weinstein handle decomposition of . Attaching a&#10;-handle alters the Legendrian boundary by surgery and adds Reeb chords&#10;in the co-core sphere of the handle of grading and it follows that all&#10;Reeb chords of have grading . To construct , we perform a version of&#10;boundary connected sum as follows. For each edge in we pick a -ball with&#10;two transversely intersecting Lagrangian disks that intersect the&#10;boundary sphere in a standard Legendrian Hopf link . We then make&#10;boundary connected sum adding to join the according to the tree. This&#10;adds Reeb chords of index in the boundary connected sum handles and&#10;further Reeb chords corresponding to the Reeb chords of each Hopf link,&#10;which effectively has four Reeb chords: two Reeb chords connecting the&#10;unknot components to themselves of grading and two mixed Reeb chords&#10;connecting distinct components. We can pick gradings so that the&#10;gradings of these two mixed chords are and for any , where the first&#10;Reeb chord goes from the component closest to priori fixed root of the&#10;tree to the one further from it and the other in the opposite direction.&#10;Taking between and we find that is simply connected as is .

Alternatively, in this case we know by Perelman’s theorem that&#10;we can take as a link of standard Legendrian spheres linked according to&#10;the tree as Hopf links and can be seen to be locally finite directly.&#10;&#10;The case corresponds to plumbing of copies of . This case was studied in&#10;and a version of the duality result still holds, at least when .&#10;However, the above argument fails in that case and a more complicated&#10;argument using an additional grading is used in . Also a set of examples&#10;for are studied in , where the plumbing tree is a star and the&#10;corresponding symplectic manifolds is a punctured torus. The duality&#10;still holds in this case, even though this is a plumbing of ’s (not&#10;simply-connected). The proof of duality given in uses homological mirror&#10;symmetry.">

In fact, duality does not hold in this example. However,&#10;Theorem \[comple\] shows that there is a quasi-isomorphisms of&#10;completions where the latter is a power series ring in two commuting&#10;variables concentrated in degree 0.&#10;&#10;Thus, the completion map composed with the twisting cochain gives an&#10;algebra map: We claim that this map is injective.

Here gives a description in terms of Morse flow trees&#10;which gives the following:&#10;&#10; consists of one disk, .&#10;&#10; consists of two disks, and .&#10;&#10; consists of two disks, and&#10;&#10;The boundaries of these disks are as follows.&#10;&#10; is fiber in the first twisted band.&#10;&#10; is a fiber in the second twisted band, and runs across the first and&#10;the second twisted band.&#10;&#10; is a fiber in the third twisted band, and runs across the second and&#10;the third twisted bands.&#10;&#10;We next describe the moduli spaces , in a completely analogous manner.&#10;The space has four components, all diffeomorphic to intervals, as&#10;follows:&#10;&#10; with one boundary point the disk in with attached, and the other the&#10;disk in with , , and attached.&#10;&#10; with one boundary point the disk in with attached, and the other the&#10;disk in with , , and attached.&#10;&#10; with one boundary point the disk in with attached, and the other the&#10;disk in with , , and attached.&#10;&#10; with one boundary point the disk in and the other the disk in with , ,&#10;and attached.&#10;&#10;Here the disks in sweeps the right hand disk of , whereas the evaluation&#10;maps of , does not map surjectively onto either disk. The moduli space&#10;also has four components only one of which sweeps the left hand disk of&#10;.&#10;&#10;In order to compute the Floer cohomology we pick a Morse function with&#10;one maximum and two saddle points and . Letting the maximum lie in the&#10;right hand disk we find: since the only way to rigidify a disk of&#10;dimension one is that its boundary passes the maximum .&#10;&#10;The twisting cochain can now in principle be computed from the moduli&#10;spaces described above by attaching flow trees. To get an algebraically&#10;feasible twisting co-chain we first arrange the perturbation scheme so&#10;that where the first term is with a flow line and the second with a flow&#10;tree, and next so that the disk with a flow line contributes, other&#10;contributions cancel (the disk with two flow lines and the same disk&#10;with a flow tree, the two distinct disks with one flow lines). Remaining&#10;parts of the twisting cochain are now determined from the co-product in&#10;the Floer homology: the twisting cochain equation, and the sweeping&#10;property of , as follows: and It is possible to check that these power&#10;series agree with the geometric count. We leave out the details but&#10;describe the mechanism. In order to arrange that only one flow line can&#10;be attached to we order the stable manifolds of the flow line of the&#10;parallel copies so that if a flow line (or flow tree) between copy and&#10;is attached then following we already passed all intersections with&#10;stable manifolds between copy and for . Now, if the disk intersects the&#10;collection of stable manifolds in the opposite direction this means that&#10;we can jump down in all ways, which then gives the desired power series.&#10;&#10;We finish this section by a brief discussion of the case decorated by&#10;and parallel copies. As usual this introduces two extra generators in&#10;addition to the Reeb chords above in , , and , , where is the counit&#10;corresponding to the minimum of the shifting function and is the&#10;maximum. In the reduced coalgebra (disregarding ) we get the new&#10;differential (using the augmentation above to change coordinates): In&#10;this case is defined instead by choosing a shifting function that&#10;increases at infinity, and is generated by the unit , and , with . The&#10;new twisting cochain is and is exactly as above, after the substitutions&#10;, .">

<outline text="Basic results for moduli spaces" _note="Consider as above a Weinstein manifold with an exact Lagrangian&#10;submanifold , which outside a compact agrees with the positive part of&#10;the symplectization of the contact manifold with Legendrian submanifold&#10;. We assume that the Maslov class of vanishes and that is relatively&#10;spin. We will consider several versions of boundary punctured&#10;holomorphic disks with boundary on . The most basic disks we consider&#10;will lie either in or in the symplectization . We call the former&#10;FILLING DISKS and the latter SYMPLECTIZATION DISKS. We will also&#10;consider a more general setting where, like in the symplectization,&#10;disks may have both positive and negative punctures. Here we assume that&#10;is a Weinstein cobordism with negative end and positive end , where is a&#10;contact manifold and is a Legendrian submanifold. More specifically we&#10;will consider a Lagrangian with positive end and empty negative end and&#10;a Lagrangian with negative end and empty positive end. We further assume&#10;that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the components&#10;of of and of , , and that corresponding components and intersect&#10;transversely in one point and that if . We call disks in COBORDISM&#10;DISKS.&#10;&#10;Following , all symplectization and cobordism disks we consider will be&#10;anchored. This means that the actual disks we consider have, except for&#10;their boundary punctures, also additional interior punctures where the&#10;maps are asymptotic to Reeb orbits at the negative end. An anchored disk&#10;is such a disk completed by rigid holomorphic planes in at all its&#10;negative interior punctures, see Figure \[anchored\]. We will count&#10;rigid disks as well as use moduli spaces of disks to parameterize chains&#10;of boundary paths which then requires studying anchored disks. Although,&#10;standard arguments using classical methods allow us to prove&#10;transversality for the disks with boundary punctures that we consider,&#10;anchored disks requires transversality and gluing also for holomorphic&#10;planes in and that requires an abstract perturbation scheme. We will not&#10;enter any detailed discussion of this subject in this paper, but would&#10;like to point out that any of the approaches could be used to prove the&#10;required abstract perturbation results and the results that we establish&#10;in this paper are independent of the detailed nature of the perturbation&#10;scheme.&#10;&#10;(2,3) to\[in=75,out=270\] (1.6,0.95); (1.53,0.55) to\[in=90,out=260\]&#10;(1.5,0);&#10;&#10;(2,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (2.5,0); (3,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (3.5,0);&#10;(2.5,3) to\[in=90,out=270\] (4,0); (1.5,0) to (2,0); (2.5,0) to (3,0);&#10;(3.5,0) to (4,0); (2,3) to (2.5,3);&#10;&#10;(2.2,1.5) to\[in=90,out=270\] (-0.5,0); (2.7,1.5) to\[in=90,out=270\]&#10;(1,0); (0.5,0) to\[in=60,out=120\] (0,0);&#10;&#10;(-0.5,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (0,0); (-0.5,0) to\[in=270,out=270\] (0,0);&#10;(0.5,0) to\[in=90,out=90\] (1,0); (0.5,0) to\[in=270,out=270\] (1,0);&#10;&#10;(-0.5,-0.35) to\[in=90,out=90\] (0,-0.35); (-0.5,-0.35)&#10;to\[in=270,out=270\] (0,-0.35); (0.5,-0.35) to\[in=90,out=90\]&#10;(1,-0.35); (0.5,-0.35) to\[in=270,out=270\] (1,-0.35);&#10;&#10;(-0.5,-0.35) to\[in=180,out=270\] (-0.25,-0.7); (0,-0.35)&#10;to\[in=0,out=270\] (-0.25,-0.7); (0.5,-0.35) to\[in=180,out=270\]&#10;(0.75,-0.7); (1,-0.35) to\[in=0,out=270\] (0.75,-0.7);&#10;&#10;Consider a system of parallel copies , where , as in Section&#10;\[sec:parallel\]. We first discuss numberings that determine the&#10;boundary conditions of our holomorphic disks. Let denote the unit disk&#10;in the complex plane with boundary punctures . One of the boundary&#10;punctures is distinguished. We choose notation so that is distinguished.&#10;The punctures subdivides the boundary of into boundary arcs. We will&#10;consider disks with numbered boundary arcs where the numbers correspond&#10;to the parallel copies . We will consider two types of numberings&#10;INCREASING and DECREASING: traversing the boundary of the disk in the&#10;positive direction starting from the distinguished puncture, the&#10;numbering increases or remain constant respectively decreases or remain&#10;constant as we pass the other punctures. We call punctures where the&#10;numbering changes non-constant and punctures where it does not change&#10;constant. If the boundary numbering has no constant puncture then we&#10;call it strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.&#10;&#10;We next consider asymptotic conditions at the boundary punctures. There&#10;are two basic forms of asymptotics, a puncture is either asymptotic to a&#10;Lagrangian intersection point or to a Reeb chord. The former case is the&#10;standard form of asymptotics on Lagrangian Floer theory and the latter&#10;in Legendrian DG-algebras. More precisely, we choose an almost complex&#10;structure on which in the cylindrical end is invariant under&#10;-translation, leaves the contact planes invariant and is compatible with&#10;the symplectic form induced on the contact planes by the contact form.&#10;Furthermore, it pairs the -direction with the Reeb direction. This means&#10;in particular that the Reeb chord strip which is the product of a Reeb&#10;chord and is holomorphic and we study holomorphic disks with boundary&#10;punctures that are asymptotic to these Reeb chord solutions.&#10;&#10;Consider a disk as above with strictly increasing or decreasing&#10;numbering and let be a word of Reeb chords and Lagrangian intersection&#10;points in . We let denote the moduli space of holomorphic disks that&#10;satisfies the following conditions:&#10;&#10; takes the boundary component labeled by to the Lagrangian .&#10;&#10; is asymptotic to the unique Reeb chord or Lagrangian intersection point&#10;of and near at , where we let .&#10;&#10;We next consider disks in the symplectization. Consider again the disk&#10;with boundary numbering and punctures . We next note that in the&#10;symplectization there are two possible Reeb chord asymptotics, positive&#10;or negative according to the sign of the -coordinate near the puncture.&#10;Let be a word of signed Reeb chords of , where is a sign. If then we&#10;require that the Reeb chords at all constant punctures connect to and&#10;that their signs are all negative, . We let denote the moduli space of&#10;holomorphic disks that satisfy the following conditions:&#10;&#10; takes the boundary components labeled by to the Lagrangian .&#10;&#10; is asymptotic at positive or negative infinity according to the sign of&#10;to the unique Reeb chord between and near at a puncture .&#10;&#10;We write for the moduli space of holomorphic disks satisfying these&#10;conditions.&#10;&#10;Finally, we consider disks in the cobordism and in the filled cobordism.&#10;We start with the cobordism disks without filling. Consider a system of&#10;parallel copies . Consider the disk where we fix two punctures that&#10;subdivide the boundary of the disk into two arcs, upper and lower. Let&#10;be a decreasing boundary numbering of the boundary components in the&#10;upper arc and extend it to a constant numbering in the lower arc. Let be&#10;a composable word of Reeb chords connecting to , and let be a word of&#10;Reeb chords of . Consider the word of Reeb chords and intersection&#10;points and let denote the moduli space of holomorphic disks such that&#10;the following holds.&#10;&#10; is asymptotic to the Reeb chord at its constant puncture, takes&#10;adjacent boundary arcs to , and neighboring punctures to the unique&#10;intersection point near in and near in , respectively.&#10;&#10;On remaining boundary arcs and punctures the boundary maps as described&#10;by and the numbering , exactly as above.&#10;&#10;The disks in the filled cobordism are entirely analogous. Here we assume&#10;that is a Lagrangian submanifold in . Consider again a system of&#10;parallel copies and also a system of parallel copies of . Consider the&#10;disk where we fix two punctures that subdivide the boundary of the disk&#10;into two arcs, upper and lower. Let be a decreasing boundary numbering&#10;of the boundary components in the upper and lower arcs. Let be a word of&#10;intersection points of and let be a word of Reeb chords of . Consider&#10;the word of Reeb chords and intersection points and let denote the&#10;moduli space of holomorphic disks such that the following holds.&#10;&#10; is asymptotic to the Reeb chord at its puncture in the lower arc, takes&#10;adjacent boundary arcs to , and neighboring punctures to the unique&#10;intersection point near in and the unique intersection point near in .&#10;&#10;On remaining boundary arcs and punctures the boundary maps as described&#10;by and the numbering , exactly as above.&#10;&#10;The formal dimension of the moduli spaces above is computed in terms of&#10;the negative of a Conley-Zehnder index of the Reeb chords. Recall of a&#10;Reeb chord of as defined for example in : we pick paths connecting base&#10;points in the boundary of the various components of , and paths&#10;connecting Reeb chord endpoints to the base points. We define to be the&#10;Maslov index of this path closed up by a positive rotation in the&#10;contact plane, and the grading . For a Lagrangian intersection between&#10;and we similarly pick paths connecting to the base points and use these&#10;to form a loop starting in and ending in and define to be the Maslov&#10;index of the loop of Lagrangian planes that results from closing up the&#10;path of Lagrangian planes along by a positive rotation, and .&#10;&#10;The above gradings are related to the grading in the Legendrian contact&#10;homology algebra, see e.g. as follows:&#10;&#10;The formal dimension of the moduli space equals The formal dimension of&#10;the moduli space equals The formal dimension of the moduli space equals&#10;The formal dimension of the moduli space equals&#10;&#10;See .&#10;&#10;We next study topological properties of the moduli spaces just defined.&#10;It turns out to be comparatively simple because of two key features.&#10;First, since we require our disks to switch copies at punctures “in the&#10;same direction” they cannot be multiply covered, and second, for the&#10;same reason there can be no boundary splitting. As in , the first&#10;property allows us to prove transversality by perturbing the almost&#10;complex structure and the second shows that the moduli spaces admit&#10;compactifications consisting only of punctured curves joined at Reeb&#10;chords. Precise formulations of these results are as follows.&#10;&#10;\[thm:mdlitv\] For generic almost complex structure the moduli spaces ,&#10;, , and are transversely cut out manifolds of dimensions and , , and ,&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;To see this we note first that if is a disk in one of the moduli spaces&#10;then it cannot be multiply covered. We use the argument of . Fix a&#10;puncture of . Consider first the more difficult case when this puncture&#10;maps to a Lagrangian intersection. Pick coordinates so that the&#10;intersection point lies at the origin in and so that the two Lagrangians&#10;correspond to and . Let be standard coordinates on . Consider the&#10;complex hyperplanes . Looking at the Fourier expansion of near the&#10;puncture it is clear that for suitable coordinates (such that the&#10;leading Fourier coefficient of lies in direction of the first&#10;coordinate) the number of intersection points of the image of and near&#10;the puncture have different parities depending on the sign of . By&#10;analytic continuation, other disks and half disks mapping there either&#10;have images agreeing completely in the ball or there are injective&#10;points of the disk near the puncture. In the case where they agree&#10;completely we note that the parity of the number of intersection points&#10;in each local sheet not containing the puncture with is independent of&#10;sign. We the find that we can achieve transversality by perturbing the&#10;complex structure near : because the sheet with the puncture intersects&#10;only one of , if the contributions of the sheets mapping to cancel then&#10;those mapping to cannot cancel and vice versa, by unique continuation.&#10;&#10;\[thm:mdlicmpct\] The moduli space admits a compactification consisting&#10;of several level disks joined at Reeb chords and intersection points,&#10;where some levels may lie in the symplectization.&#10;&#10;The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level&#10;disks joined at Reeb chords.&#10;&#10;The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level&#10;disks joined at Reeb chords. There is one level of disks in the&#10;cobordisms and remaining levels in the symplectization ends.&#10;&#10;The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level&#10;disks joined at Reeb chords and intersection points.&#10;&#10;Note that the boundary condition on our punctured disks have the&#10;following property: any arc that subdivides the source into two&#10;components with a positive puncture in each must connect boundary&#10;components numbered with distinct numbers. This shows that there can be&#10;no boundary splitting. The theorem then follows from SFT compactness .&#10;&#10;We next discuss orientations of moduli spaces following . We fix capping&#10;operators at all Reeb chords and Lagrangian intersection points so that&#10;the two capping operators there glue to a disk with the Fukaya&#10;orientation, see . Recall the relative spin structure on the Lagrangian&#10;submanifold induces an orientation on the determinant bundle over the&#10;space of disks with boundary condition in the Lagrangian, see. As in we&#10;see that these choices then induces a system of coherent orientations on&#10;the moduli spaces.&#10;&#10;We will use one more property of the moduli spaces which says that they&#10;are effectively independent of the increasing or decreasing boundary&#10;labeling .&#10;&#10;\[thm:mdlicopies\] Let and be two increasing (decreasing) boundary&#10;numberings. Then there are canonical orientation preserving&#10;diffeomorphisms&#10;&#10;Let denote either one of the above moduli spaces. This moduli space is&#10;the transverse zero set of a Fredholm section in a Banach bundle.&#10;Changing the numbering from to corresponds to an arbitrarily small&#10;isotopy which induces an arbitrarily small deformation of the section.&#10;The theorem follows.">

Consider the word of Reeb chords and&#10;intersection points&#10;&#10;Define ,&#10;&#10;Note that if is the minimum of the Morse function on as above then&#10;because of the unique holomorphic disk corresponding to the flow line&#10;from the minimum to the intersection point between , for the parallel&#10;copies this gives a triangle with corners at , at , and at , and since&#10;there are no negative punctures the output is . Also, and if a word of&#10;generators of contains a generator and has length then as this&#10;corresponds to a holomorphic disk with a flow line from the minimum&#10;attached and such a configuration cannot be rigid unless the disk is&#10;constant.&#10;&#10;\[l:BEEdiagonal\] The maps gives an -map which is an quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;[**Sketch of proof:**]{} In order to see the -relations we study the&#10;boundary of the moduli space .

The boundary of the&#10;moduli space thus consists of the following configurations.&#10;&#10;Two level curves with one level in the cobordism and one in either&#10;symplectization end.&#10;&#10;Curves which split at the intersection point .&#10;&#10;Splitting corresponds to the map followed by the operation in .&#10;Splitting corresponds to the tensor product of the map followed by the&#10;product operation in . The -relations follow.&#10;&#10;To see that is a quasi-isomorphism we show that induces an isomorphism&#10;on homology by constructing algebraically one holomorphic disks&#10;interpolating between a Reeb chord of and the corresponding word of Reeb&#10;chords of . The existence of such disks implies that the map has a&#10;triangular matrix with respect to the action filtration and hence is a&#10;chain isomorphism, compare .&#10;&#10;To construct the required interpolating disks one starts from unique and&#10;uniformly transversely cut out such disks for single chord words&#10;obtained by a straightforward explicit geometric construction. Gluing&#10;such disks at their Lagrangian intersection punctures in and using small&#10;action to rule out all breakings except one, we find that there is&#10;algebraically one disk interpolating between a chord on and the&#10;corresponding word of chords of , see . The map being an&#10;-quasi-isomorphism then follows from the word length spectral sequence.&#10;&#10;A complete proof of Theorem \[l:BEEdiagonal\] has not yet appeared. In&#10;cases when splitting at Reeb orbits can be neglected it is possible to&#10;fill in the details in the above outline with classical techniques. As&#10;mentioned above, in the general case one must employ abstract&#10;perturbations to control holomorphic planes of anchored disks. The&#10;details of the perturbation scheme will not affect the argument.&#10;&#10;There is also an “upside-down” perspective on the surgery just&#10;described. Namely, one can start from the contact manifold and produce&#10;the contact manifold by doing so called -surgery on . In complete&#10;analogy with the above one shows that Reeb chords on are in natural one&#10;to one correspondence with words of Reeb chords on and one can construct&#10;an upside down surgery map of co-algebras: A similar argument also shows&#10;that this map is a quasi-isomorphism. Alternatively, one can prove this&#10;from the original surgery map using only algebra as follows. First write&#10;then since is co-nilpotent, see Section \[ssec:barcobaradj\].">

  <outline text="Legendrian surgery and stopped wrapping" _note="In this section we outline a surgery approach to the computation of&#10;wrapped Floer homology in a Weinstein manifold with wrapping stopped by&#10;a Legendrian in its boundary. We will use the following model for the&#10;ambient manifold. Fix a tubular neighborhood of in the contact boundary&#10;of and attach a disk-bundle neighborhood of the -section in along the&#10;boundary just like in Lagrangian handle attachment. We use a Liouville&#10;vector field on this domain that agrees with the standard Liouville&#10;vector field pointing outwards along fibers in the cotangent bundle over&#10;for some . Let the components of be denoted , . Fix a base point for&#10;each . Let denote the cotangent fiber . We will compute the wrapped&#10;Floer cohomology of for sufficiently large using a surgery approach.&#10;&#10;We first consider the surgery map into the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra&#10;with loop space coefficients. Consider all components of decorated by a&#10;positive sign and consider which now involves, except for Reeb chords,&#10;also chains on the based loop space. We define an - map where -structure&#10;on the left hand side is the standard DG-algebra structure induced by&#10;concatenation and the Pontryagin product. As in Section&#10;\[sec:mdlispaces\], consider a disk with two dividing punctures that&#10;subdivides the boundary into two arcs, lower and upper. Let the upper&#10;arc contain boundary punctures and is equipped with a decreasing&#10;boundary numbering and the lower arc boundary punctures. Let be Reeb&#10;chords of and let be Reeb chords of . Let and consider , again as in&#10;Figure \[surgerymap\].&#10;&#10;Theorems \[thm:mdlitv\] and \[thm:mdlicmpct\] show that this moduli&#10;space carries a fundamental chain. We view this chain as parametrizing&#10;chains of paths in connecting the Reeb chord endpoints in . We write for&#10;the alternating word of chains of loops and Reeb chords and view it as&#10;an element in . Define the maps as&#10;&#10;\[t:newsurgeryAinfty\] The map is an -map.&#10;&#10;To see that the -relation holds we look at the boundary of the moduli&#10;space of dimension . The codimension one boundary consists of three&#10;splittings:&#10;&#10;A one-dimensional curve splits off in the positive symplectization end.&#10;&#10;A one-dimensional curve splits off at the negative end.&#10;&#10;Splitting at one of the intersection points .&#10;&#10;In order for splittings of the form to contribute to the codimension one&#10;boundary of the moduli space the part of the holomorphic building in&#10;consists of rigid disks with only positive punctures attached at one&#10;puncture to a negative puncture of the disk in the positive end and a&#10;disk of dimension in attached at the remaining negative puncture.&#10;Assembling the rigid disks and the one-dimensional disk we get a partial&#10;holomorphic disk building that contributes to the -operations in&#10;followed by the map . Splittings of type corresponds to the map followed&#10;by the differential in . Finally splittings of type correspond to the&#10;map followed by the product on . We conclude that the terms contributing&#10;to -relations express the codimension one boundary of in two different&#10;ways and hence is an -map.&#10;&#10;We will use slight generalizations of the map below. More precisely, if&#10;, are points in and if is the cotangent fiber at then we have a similar&#10;surgery map which counts holomorphic disks with a positive Reeb chord&#10;connecting to , two Lagrangian intersection punctures at and at , and a&#10;word of chains of loops in and Reeb chords of as output, and where is&#10;directly analogous to but where the first chain of loops is in a word is&#10;replaced by a chain of paths from to the base point and the last is&#10;replaced by a chain of paths from the base point to . In this setup the&#10;counterpart of the second component is and counts disks with two&#10;positive punctures at Reeb chords and two Lagrangian intersection&#10;punctures at and . The counterpart of the -equations in this setup is&#10;then where is the differential on and where is the (Pontryagin) product&#10;. The proofs of these statements are word by word repetitions of the&#10;proof of Theorem \[t:newsurgeryAinfty\].&#10;&#10;We next sketch a proof that the map in Theorem \[t:newsurgeryAinfty\] is&#10;in fact a quasi-isomorphism, or, in other words, that its first&#10;component induces an isomorphism on homology. We filter by action of its&#10;Reeb chord generators. To get a corresponding filtration on we use&#10;action on Reeb chords in combination with the energy on the loops. We&#10;start with a discussion of the energy of loops, following .&#10;&#10;Equip with a Riemannian metric and denote the space of based loops in&#10;with the supremum norm: for two loops , where is the metric on induced&#10;by the Riemannian structure. Then the metric topology on agrees with the&#10;standard compact open topology.&#10;&#10;Let denote the space of piecewise smooth paths with metric where denotes&#10;the derivative of . The natural inclusion is a homotopy equivalence, .&#10;We will use finite dimensional approximations to study . The energy of a&#10;piece-wise smooth loop in is For , let denote the subset of loops of&#10;energy . The space can be approximated by piece-wise geodesic loops.&#10;More precisely, fixing a subdivision of we consider the space of loops&#10;of energy that are geodesic on each interval . Then shows that for all&#10;sufficiently fine subdivisions is a finite dimensional manifold (a&#10;submanifold of the product in a natural way). Moreover , all critical&#10;points of lie in which is a deformation retract of and for generic&#10;metric is a Morse function.&#10;&#10;With these preliminaries established we turn to the actual proof. The&#10;first step will be to describe the Reeb chords of . Let be a Riemannian&#10;metric on as above and let be a positive function with , , and monotone&#10;increasing. Define the metric on by&#10;&#10;Then if and are points in and is a geodesic with and then there is a&#10;unique geodesic such that&#10;&#10; and ;&#10;&#10; is Morse with has a unique maximum at an interior point .&#10;&#10;Note that the Reeb flow in the unit disk bundle is the natural lift of&#10;the geodesic flow. Assume next as above that the metric on is generic in&#10;the sense that the length functional for curves connecting any two Reeb&#10;chord endpoints in has only Morse critical points. Concretely, this&#10;means that the index form of any geodesic connecting two Reeb chord&#10;endpoints is non-degenerate. As in Lemma \[l:BEEchords=words\], this&#10;allows us to control the Reeb chords of below a given action for all&#10;sufficiently thin handles. More precisely, let denote the size of the&#10;tubular neighborhood of in where we attach and we introduce the&#10;following notion of a geodesic-Reeb chord word. A GEODESIC-REEB CHORD&#10;WORD is a word where is a geodesic from one of the base points to the&#10;start point of the Reeb chord , where is a geodesic from the endpoint of&#10;to the start point of , etc, until finally is a geodesic from the&#10;endpoint of the Reeb chord to one of the base points . We define the&#10;action of a geodesic-Reeb chord word to be the sum of actions of its&#10;Reeb chords and the energies of its geodesics.&#10;&#10;\[l:newchords=words\] For any there exists and such that for any and any&#10;there is a natural one to one correspondence between Reeb chords of of&#10;action and geodesic-Reeb chord words of of action .&#10;&#10;[**Sketch of proof:**]{} The proof uses the transversality of the Reeb&#10;chords and of the geodesics. The basic observation is that the point in&#10;the normal fiber of where the Reeb flow hits determines the direction of&#10;the geodesic in . After introducing a concrete smoothing of corners the&#10;lemma then follows from the finite dimensional inverse function theorem.&#10;&#10;To show that is a quasi-isomorphism we will show that it is represented&#10;by a triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal with respect to the&#10;action/energy filtration. To this end we will use the Morse theoretic&#10;finite dimensional model for the chain complex underlying the homology&#10;of the based loop space described above. In order to have defined as a&#10;chain in this model we need to assure that the paths on the boundary of&#10;the holomorphic disk are sufficiently well behaved. We only sketch the&#10;construction. On holomorphic disk with unstable domains, we fix gauge&#10;using small spheres surrounding Reeb chord endpoint, compare . As in we&#10;use a configuration space for holomorphic curves consisting of maps with&#10;two derivatives in . This means that the restriction to the boundary has&#10;derivatives in and in particular the projection to has bounded energy.&#10;Since the action of the positive puncture in a holomorphic disk&#10;contributing to the differential controls the norm of the solution it&#10;follows that we can use configuration spaces of bounded energy to study&#10;the disks in the differential: we approximate the boundary curves&#10;uniformly by a piecewise geodesic curve by introducing a uniformly&#10;bounded number of subdivision points and straight line homotopies in&#10;small charts.&#10;&#10;\[appconj\] The chain-map induces an isomorphism on homology.&#10;&#10;[**Sketch of proof:**]{} Consider a word of the form where are geodesics&#10;in and where are Reeb chords. We aim to construct algebraically one disk&#10;connecting the Reeb chord of , corresponding to this word (see Lemma&#10;\[l:newchords=words\]), to the word itself. We use an inductive argument&#10;and energy filtration. To start the argument we pick additional fiber&#10;disks and in at and for very small near all Reeb chord end points and in&#10;. We use the natural counterparts of the for mixed wrapped Floer&#10;homologies. For example, there is a straightforward analogue of Lemma&#10;\[l:newchords=words\]: Reeb chord generators of correspond before the&#10;surgery words of the form where is a geodesic connecting the base point&#10;of to the startpoint of , from the endpoint of to the start point of ,&#10;etc. To start the argument we note that it is straightforward to&#10;construct holomorphic strips corresponding to the short geodesics&#10;starting at followed by the chord and then the short geodesic to and to&#10;show that they are unique. This corresponds to a generator of .&#10;Likewise, it is immediate to construct the holomorphic disk connecting a&#10;Reeb chord generator of corresponding to a geodesic, and show that it is&#10;unique, compare Lemma \[l:BEEdiagonal\].&#10;&#10;We now use these two to construct algebraically one disk from the Reeb&#10;chord generator of corresponding to the short geodesic, the chord , and&#10;a geodesic connecting the endpoint of to the base point of . To this end&#10;we consider the natural map see . For the two Reeb chords connecting to&#10;corresponding to the chord of , and connecting to corresponding to the&#10;geodesic we then have (with denoting the base point): Here we know that&#10;the terms containing and involves non-trivial holomorphic disks or Morse&#10;flows in the finite dimensional approximation and hence lowers&#10;action/energy by an amount bounded below by some which we assume is much&#10;larger than above. Therefore, if we restrict attention to a small action&#10;window we find Here the first term is simply the Pontryagin product at&#10;the common endpoint of the curves, which is homologous to the word of&#10;the small geodesic, the Reeb chord and then the longer geodesic, by&#10;rounding the corner at . It follows that , where is a Reeb chord with&#10;action between the sum of the actions of and and the action of and that&#10;contains this word with coefficient . Noting that there is only one Reeb&#10;chord in the action window studied we find that the desired coefficient&#10;equals . It is now clear how to continue the induction, in each step we&#10;add one more geodesic or Reeb chord to any word. Using already&#10;constructed curves and in a small action window we find that the map has&#10;a triangular action matrix with on the diagonal, hence it is a&#10;quasi-isomorphism.&#10;&#10;[9999]{}&#10;&#10;Abouzaid, M., Morse homology, tropical geometry, and homological mirror&#10;symmetry for toric varieties.
