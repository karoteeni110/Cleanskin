    <title>Polarons Explain Luminescence Behavior of Colloidal Quantum Dots at Low
Temperature</title>
    <abstract>Luminescence properties of colloidal quantum dots have found
applications in imaging, displays, light-emitting diodes and lasers, and
single photon sources. Despite wide interest, several experimental
observations in low-temperature photoluminescence of these quantum dots,
such as the short lifetime on the scale of microseconds and a
zero-longitudinal optical phonon line in spectrum, both attributed to a
dark exciton in literature, remain unexplained by existing models. Here
we propose a theoretical model including the effect of solid-state
environment on luminescence. The model captures both coherent and
incoherent interactions of band-edge exciton with phonon modes. Our
model predicts formation of dressed states by coupling of the exciton
with a confined acoustic phonon mode, and explains the short lifetime
and the presence of the zero-longitudinal optical phonon line in the
spectrum. Accounting for the interaction of the exciton with bulk phonon
modes, the model also explains the experimentally observed
temperature-dependence of the photoluminescence decay dynamics and
temperature-dependence of the photoluminescence spectrum. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Colloidal quantum dots show size-tunable luminescence spectrum , have&#10;high luminescence efficiency at room temperature , and can be easily&#10;functionalized for incorporation into a variety of systems . These&#10;properties make them useful as biomarkers , gain materials for light&#10;emitting diodes and lasers , and electroluminescent materials for&#10;displays . They are also potential candidates for single photon sources&#10;. It is crucial to understand the fundamental mechanism for luminescence&#10;in these quantum dots to tailor their properties for different&#10;applications and to overcome issues like blinking , trapping of carriers&#10;, and non-radiative recombination processes that hinder many potential&#10;applications. For these reasons, colloidal quantum dots have been the&#10;subject of many experimental and theoretical studies.&#10;&#10;Luminescence spectrum and decay dynamics of a quantum dot are governed&#10;by the band-edge exciton and its interaction with the solid-state&#10;environment. Numerous experiments and theoretical calculations have&#10;established that the fine structure of the band-edge exciton in a&#10;variety of colloidal quantum dots — CdSe, InAs, CdTe, PbSe, ZnSe,&#10;InP/ZnS, and Ge — includes the lowest-lying “dark” exciton state from&#10;which optical transition to ground state is forbidden, followed by a&#10;higher-energy “bright” exciton state from which optical transition to&#10;ground state is allowed . Because optical transitions are forbidden, a&#10;dark state should have an infinitely large radiative lifetime; in&#10;reality, interaction with solid-state environment reduces the lifetime.&#10;Even after taking such interactions into account, theoretical&#10;calculations predict dark exciton lifetimes on the order of milliseconds&#10;. However, experimentally observed lifetimes at 2 K, when most of the&#10;excited-state population is expected to reside in the lowest-lying dark&#10;exciton state, are found to be surprisingly lower, in the range of 0.35&#10;s - 81 s .&#10;&#10;For temperatures less than 20 K, photoluminescence decay of colloidal&#10;quantum dots exhibits two distinct lifetimes . At 2 K, the longer of&#10;these approaches the above mentioned microsecond-scale lifetime (the&#10;other being much smaller), and has been found to vary with temperature&#10;in a variety of colloidal quantum dots . To explain the temperature&#10;dependencene, a three-level model with ground, dark, and bright states,&#10;and with thermal distribution of population between the dark and the&#10;bright states, has been widely used . Although the model predicts the&#10;temperature-dependence of the lifetime, it does not explain the&#10;shortening of the lifetime of the dark exciton from theoretically&#10;predicted milliseconds to experimentally observed microseconds . The&#10;model also does not explain other experimental observations. In the&#10;photoluminescence spectrum at 2 K, three closely and almost equally&#10;spaced peaks have been observed . The lowest energy peak has been&#10;attributed to confined acoustic phonon sideband of the dark exciton, and&#10;the two higher energy peaks are attributed to zero-longitudinal phonon&#10;(LO) lines of the dark and the bright exciton. The existing theoretical&#10;model does not explain the existence of the lowest energy peak, and&#10;though the model assigns one of the peaks in photoluminecsence spectrum&#10;to zero-LO phonon line of the dark exciton, the origin of radiaitve&#10;decay of dark exciton is not understood . In experiments, the relative&#10;strengths of the three peaks change and their linewidths increase with&#10;increase in temperature .&#10;&#10;To explain the short lifetime of the dark exciton at low temperatures,&#10;three hypotheses have been proposed. The first hypothesis attributed the&#10;shortening of lifetime to surface states which could result in mixing of&#10;the dark and the bright exciton states . However, this hypothesis is&#10;disproved by the experiments in which changes in surface passivation&#10;coating did not affect the lifetime . The second hypothesis attributes&#10;the shortening of lifetime to LO phonon-assisted recombination of the&#10;dark exciton . Indeed, LO phonon sideband of the dark exciton has been&#10;observed in photoluminescence measurements . However, experimental&#10;observation of a zero-LO-phonon line for the dark exciton in&#10;photlouminescence spectrum shows that the dark exciton must also have a&#10;direct radiative decay channel, unaccounted in the hypothesis. The third&#10;hypothesis states that the shortening of lifetime is caused by the&#10;exciton coupling to confined acoustic phonon modes ; however no specific&#10;coupling mechanism has been proposed or demonstrated.&#10;&#10;Here we propose a model to explain the unexpectedly short exciton&#10;lifetime in colloidal quantum dots at low temperatures, building upon a&#10;set of recent observations. Confined acoustic phonon modes have been&#10;observed in colloidal quantum dots in a variety of experiments . Because&#10;the observed confined acoustic phonons have energy in the range of 1-10&#10;meV, which matches with the observed energy gap between the bright and&#10;the dark excitons , and because the phonon modes exhibit a&#10;characteristic discrete spectrum (long coherence) , strong&#10;exciton-acoustic phonon coupling in colloidal quantum dots is expected.&#10;This behavior is analogous to that seen in self-assembled indium&#10;arsenide quantum dots in which both experiments and theoretical&#10;calculations have shown formation of polarons by strong coupling of&#10;exciton and LO phonons; this coupling occurs because LO phonon energy&#10;often matches the energy gap between exciton states and because LO&#10;phonons have weak dispersion . Based on these observations, we propose&#10;that the photoluminescence spectrum and photoluminescence decay dynamics&#10;of colloidal quantum dots at low temperatures can be explained by strong&#10;coupling between exciton and a confined acoustic phonon mode, resulting&#10;in dressed exciton-phonon (polaron) states.&#10;&#10;Our model for the colloidal quantum dot at low temperature consists of a&#10;ground state, a dark exciton state, and a bright exciton state (as&#10;predicted from fine structure of band-edge exciton), where the excitonic&#10;states are coupled via a confined (coherent) acoustic phonon mode and&#10;also interact with a bath of bulk (incoherent and dispersive) phonons.&#10;The model predicts that the strongly-coupled exciton-confined acoustic&#10;phonon system has three excited energy eigenstates: dressed bright,&#10;dressed dark, and bare dark exciton states. Our calculations reveal that&#10;(a) the microsecond-scale excitonic lifetime observed at low&#10;temperatures is the radiative lifetime of the dressed dark state. The&#10;model also explains (b) the temperature-dependence of photoluminescence&#10;decay , (c) the existence of the lowest energy peak in the three-peak&#10;spectrum and the radiative decay channel of the zero-LO phonon line of&#10;the dark exciton , and (d) the temperature-dependence of the&#10;photoluminescence spectrum .">

<outline text="Quantum Dot Model" _note="We model a colloidal quantum dot as a three level system consisting of a&#10;ground , a dark exciton and a bright exciton state (Fig.&#10;\[Fig:BareQD\_schematic\]a), which is sufficient for modeling the&#10;photoluminescence behavior . The Hamiltonian accounting for the&#10;interaction of the quantum dot with a confined acoustic phonon mode,&#10;under rotating wave approximation, is Here, we set the energy of the&#10;ground state of the quantum dot to zero. We define and as the resonant&#10;frequencies of the bare dark and the bare bright exciton states, and as&#10;the frequency of the confined acoustic phonon mode (Fig.&#10;\[Fig:BareQD\_schematic\]a). The operator represents atomic dipole&#10;operator when and atomic population operator when . Boson annihilation&#10;(creation) operator for confined acoustic phonon mode is (). The&#10;excitons interact with the confined acoustic phonon mode via deformation&#10;potential coupling , which is governed by (Fig.&#10;\[Fig:BareQD\_schematic\]a). Many experimental findings in colloidal&#10;quantum dots at low temperatures suggest that is greater than the decay&#10;rates of excitons and the confined acoustic phonon mode . Therefore, we&#10;consider the excitonic states and the confined acoustic phonon mode to&#10;be strongly coupled. Diagonalization of system Hamiltonian, (Eq.&#10;\[eq:H\_S\]), gives three excited eigenstates (dressed or polaron&#10;states) for the first ladder of the manifold : ; ; and .&#10;&#10;The corresponding eigen-frequencies are , , and , where Here , is the&#10;detuning between the dark-bright splitting and the confined acoustic&#10;phonon mode energy, and represents combined state of exciton-phonon&#10;system without dressing (factorized state) with index for the quantum&#10;dot states and index for confined acoustic phonon states (Fig.&#10;\[Fig:BareQD\_schematic\]b). Since we are interested in understanding&#10;luminescence behavior of the quantum dots at low temperature (upto 20&#10;K), regime in which average phonon number is less than 1, we restrict&#10;our analysis to the first ladder of the manifold.&#10;&#10;The radiative decay rates for the dressed states (Fig.&#10;\[Fig:BareQD\_schematic\]c) are where is the radiative decay rate of&#10;bare bright exciton state ; see Methods Eq.&#10;\[eq:DecayRate\_DressedState1\_+-\] for derivation.&#10;&#10;To analyze the dynamics of the dressed system by including incoherent&#10;processes resulting from interaction with phonon bath and photon bath,&#10;we use master equation: , where is the combined density matrix of the&#10;quantum dot-phonon system, is the system Hamiltonian in the dressed&#10;state basis (Methods Eq. \[eq:H\_DressedState\]), , , and represent&#10;Lindblad superoperators accounting for spontaneous emission, phonon&#10;scattering and pure dephasing, and incoherent pumping, respectively&#10;(Methods Eq. \[eq:L\_ph\]). We neglect terms containing bilinear&#10;functions of phonon operators in our analysis. Since and are dependent&#10;on material and size of the quantum dot , a range of values are possible&#10;for both the parameters. Putting a conservative bound on the possible&#10;detuning in the system, we assume . Under this condition, the dressed&#10;dark state (lower polaron, ) is predominantly a phononic state and the&#10;dressed bright state (upper polaron, ) is predominantly an excitonic&#10;state. Hence, we neglect interactions of with excitonic states, and ,&#10;via a phonon.&#10;&#10;We derive the equations of motion for the state-populations from the&#10;master equation as&#10;&#10;and relevant dipole transition dynamics as&#10;&#10;where is bulk phonon-assisted spin-flip rate between the dressed bright&#10;and the bare dark exciton states, where , is incoherent pumping rate for&#10;different energy eigenstates, is the radiative decay rate of bare dark&#10;exciton state , and is bulk phonon number under thermal equilibrium at&#10;temperature and energy . Figure \[Fig:DressedState\_schematic\] shows&#10;the various energy levels and the population decay rates in the dressed&#10;state basis. The decay rates of the dipole moments (Eq.&#10;\[eq:EquationofMotion\_dipole\]) in the dressed state basis are , , and&#10;, where and is pure dephasing rate. Using Eqs.&#10;\[eq:EquationofMotion\_population\]-\[eq:EquationofMotion\_dipole\] we&#10;next calculate expressions for steady-state luminescence spectrum and&#10;luminescence decay.">

<outline text="Steady-state Luminescence Spectrum" _note="To calculate expression for steady-state luminescence spectrum of this&#10;quantum dot-phonon system, we express the electric field operator at the&#10;detector as ; because the separation between transition frequencies is&#10;small (1-10 meV), we assume the collection efficiency of the detector is&#10;the same for various transition frequencies. Using equations of motion&#10;of transition dipoles (Eq. \[eq:EquationofMotion\_dipole\]) and Quantum&#10;Regression Theorem , we calculate two-time correlation function of the&#10;electric field at the detector, and calculate steady-state luminescence&#10;spectrum, , using Wiener-Khinchin theorem (Methods Eq.&#10;\[eq:WeinerKhinchin\]). The relative contributions of various&#10;transitions to the steady-state luminescence spectrum in Eq.&#10;\[eq:Spectrum\] depend on respective steady-state populations of each&#10;excited state, , where . We evaluate by solving Eq.&#10;\[eq:EquationofMotion\_population\] in steady state. Eq. \[eq:Spectrum\]&#10;immediately provides an explanation for the observation that the steady&#10;state spectrum consists of three peaks at eigenenergies (Eq.&#10;\[eq:eigenenergies\_+-\]) of the quantum dot-phonon system. All three&#10;peaks correspond to zero-LO phonon states. However, the middle peak —&#10;assigned in literature to the zero-LO phonon line of the dark exciton&#10;(’F’) — has been been a puzzling observation, as described above. Our&#10;model clears the confusion by qualifying the nature of the state further&#10;— the middle peak corresponds to the zero-LO phonon line of the dressed&#10;dark state of the exciton-confined acoustic phonon system. The dressing&#10;imparts a partial bright character to the dark-exciton-one-phonon&#10;factorized state (Eq. \[eq:DecayRate\_DressedState2\_-\]) due to which&#10;it appears in the emission spectrum. Similarly, our model shows that the&#10;highest energy peak that has been assigned in literature to the zero-LO&#10;phonon line of the bright exciton (’A’) is actually zero-LO phonon line&#10;of the dressed bright state of the exciton-confined acoustic phonon&#10;system. Further, the lowest energy peak has also been observed in&#10;experiments, and was assigned to the confined acoustic phonon sideband&#10;of the dark exciton (’Ac’) . However, this assignment has been&#10;problematic, as it also predicts a confined acoustic phonon sideband of&#10;the bright exciton, which has not been observed in experiments. Our&#10;model shows that the lowest energy peak actually corresponds to the&#10;zero-confined acoustic phonon line of the bare dark exciton state.">

<outline text="Luminescence Decay Dynamics" _note="Next, we investigate the dynamics of luminescence decay of the quantum&#10;dot. Upon pulsed excitation at time 0, the luminescence signal received&#10;by the detector is , again assuming the collection efficiency of the&#10;detector is the same for all three transition frequencies. To calculate&#10;time-dependent expressions for populations, we solve coupled equations&#10;of motion, Eq. \[eq:EquationofMotion\_population\], with pumping rates&#10;0, in terms of initial conditions where . The eigenvalues of the matrix&#10;in Eq. \[eq:EquationofMotion\_population\] represent eigen decay rates&#10;of the system, and are given by Eq. \[eq:EigenValues\_DecayRate\] in&#10;Methods section. In colloidal quantum dots, typical values for phonon&#10;assisted spin-flip times are 100 ps, bright exciton decay lifetime 10&#10;ns, and expected dark exciton lifetime 1 ms . Therefore, ; and ; these&#10;conditions simplify Eq. \[eq:EigenValues\_DecayRate\] to Here, eigen&#10;decay rate represents decay rate of the dressed dark state that is&#10;predominantly a phononic state. The population of the dressed dark state&#10;decays only due to spontaneous emission of photons, resulting in&#10;temperature-independent decay of its population. The other two states,&#10;the dressed bright and the bare dark exciton, exchange population via&#10;bulk phonons; their decay is characterized by a fast rate that&#10;represents the non-radiative decay of population due to a bulk&#10;phonon-assisted spin-flip process and a slow rate that represents the&#10;radiative decay of populations due to spontaneous emission of photons.&#10;The signal received by the detector takes the form where , , and&#10;represent contribution of respective eigen decay rates to the detected&#10;signal .

<outline text="Calculations for CdSe Quantum Dots" _note="To perform calculations, we consider the specific case of CdSe colloidal&#10;quantum dots. In time-resolved photoluminescence experiments on these&#10;quantum dots at 2 K, two distinct decays have been observed: an&#10;extremely fast decay and a slow decay with lifetime of 1 s that is&#10;temperature independent below 2 K . From Eq.&#10;\[eq:EigenValues\_DecayRate\_simplified\], at 2 K when , we associate&#10;the fast decay to , and the slow and temperature-independent decay to .&#10;Therefore, we assign the observed 1 s lifetime to the dressed dark state&#10;of our model and set ns. The bright exciton is expected to have an&#10;intrinsic radiative lifetime of about 10 ns , and therefore we set decay&#10;rate of bare bright exciton 0.1 ns. Using Eq.&#10;\[eq:DecayRate\_DressedState2\_-\], and the values of and , we estimate&#10;0.1; this low value is not surprising when the system has not been&#10;engineered for maximising the coupling or minimizing the detuning . The&#10;above analysis also gives 0.1 ns (Eq.&#10;\[eq:DecayRate\_DressedState2\_+\]). Since the bare dark exciton is&#10;expected to have lifetime in milliseconds , we set the decay rate of the&#10;bare dark exciton to 10 ns. We set 0.08 meV (see Supporting Information&#10;Fig. S1 for results with other values of ), in agreement with&#10;experimentally estimated values of less than meV . We set 2000 meV.&#10;Further, we set bulk phonon-assisted spin-flip rate 10 ns and pure&#10;dephasing rate as a linear function of temperature , where 0.6 ns. With&#10;these parameters, strong coupling condition — greater than the quantum&#10;dot decay rates and the decay rate of the confined acoustic phonon mode&#10;which has been shown to be 10 ns — is also satisfied for .&#10;&#10;Figure \[Fig:Anti\_Crossing\] shows variation of eigenenergies of the&#10;dressed exciton-phonon system (shown by solid lines) and of the&#10;factorized exciton-phonon system (shown by dashed lines) with the energy&#10;of the confined acoustic phonon mode, in the absence of any incoherent&#10;and decay processes. The state with energy is common to both the dressed&#10;and the factorized exciton-phonon systems. The other two eigenenergies&#10;of the dressed system are and , and they exhibit the signature&#10;anti-crossing behavior. The remaining exciton-phonon factorized states&#10;have energies and . This figure shows that the dressed exciton-phonon&#10;system has three resonances in the emission spectrum. For further&#10;calculations, we set the confined phonon mode energy, 1 meV (see&#10;Supporting Information Fig. S1 for results with other values of ).&#10;&#10;To estimate relative strength of the three peaks in the luminescence&#10;spectrum of the quantum dot and analyze how the spectrum changes with&#10;temperature, we calculate the steady state spectrum using Eq.&#10;\[eq:Spectrum\]. We set equal pumping rate for the phononic state () and&#10;the excitonic states combined (split equally in and ); 10 ns so that it&#10;is much smaller than all other decay rates of the system. Figure&#10;\[Fig:Spectrum\]a shows that at T = 2 K, three peaks, as seen in&#10;experiments , are present.&#10;&#10;The inset shows a closer view of the individual peaks at 2 K on a&#10;normalized intensity scale and the same energy scale. At 2 K, when , the&#10;linewidth of the dressed bright state , the linewidth of the dressed&#10;dark state and the linewidth of the bare dark exciton state (Eq.&#10;\[eq:Spectrum\]). Since is an order of magnitude larger than and four&#10;orders of magnitude larger than , the linewidth of the dressed bright&#10;peak is much broader than the other two peaks. At low temperatures, the&#10;bulk phonon density, which is responsible for transfer of population&#10;between the bare dark exciton and dressed bright states, grows as with&#10;temperature; therefore, as the temperature is increased, the population&#10;of bare dark exciton state rapidly decreases and of the dressed bright&#10;increases (Fig. \[Fig:Spectrum\]b). This results in rapid decrease in&#10;intensity of the bare dark exciton peak in the spectrum&#10;(Fig.\[Fig:Spectrum\]a). We calculate spectrum for a range of values of&#10;and and observe similar behavior as in Fig. \[Fig:Spectrum\]a&#10;(Supporting Information Fig. S1).&#10;&#10;With increase in temperature, pure dephasing rate increases, which in&#10;turn increases the linewidth of the bare dark and the dressed bright&#10;exciton peaks (Fig. \[Fig:Spectrum\]a). However, pure dephasing is not&#10;the dominant mechanism for observed linewidth broadening in colloidal&#10;quantum dots ; in agreement with this, our calculations do not predict&#10;the broad linewidths (Fig.\[Fig:Spectrum\]a) seen in experiments .&#10;Rather, broadening of linewidths is primarily caused by spectral&#10;diffusion attributed to random fluctuation in the local environment of&#10;colloidal quantum dots . To incorporate the effect of spectral&#10;diffusion, we sample the transition frequencies from Gaussian&#10;distributions with means and , as in Fig.\[Fig:Spectrum\]a. Each step of&#10;spectrum computation, corresponding to one pair of frequencies sampled&#10;from the Gaussian distribution, is treated as 10-s observation. The&#10;spectra are then integrated for a minute (i.e. 6 million steps). The&#10;standard deviations of the Gaussian distributions, reflecting the&#10;fluctuations in the local environment, are expected to depend on the&#10;temperature, although the precise relationship between spectral&#10;diffusion linewidth and temperature is unknown. We assume a simple,&#10;linear dependence on temperature: standard deviations is modeled as 6&#10;ns, where the coefficient is arbitrarily chosen to resemble peak-width&#10;seen in experiments; we found that the observed behavior remains&#10;qualitatively unchanged if the coefficient (Supporting Information Fig.&#10;S2) or the nature of the temperature dependence is changed (Supporting&#10;Information Fig. S3).&#10;&#10;Figure \[Fig:Spectrum\]c plots steady state spectrum after 1-minute&#10;integration. As the temperature is increased, the linewidth of all the&#10;peaks increases and the peaks start to merge, a behavior that was also&#10;seen in experiments but was attributed to thermal mixing between the two&#10;higher energy states (dressed dark and dressed bright of our system) via&#10;acoustic phonons . Our model rigorously accounts for&#10;temperature-dependence of quantum dot spectrum and provides an&#10;explanation for experimentally observed behavior. Note that, in the&#10;absence of spectral diffusion at 2 K, the dressed bright peak has a&#10;wider linewidth but lower intensity than the bare dark peak (inset of&#10;Fig. \[Fig:Spectrum\]a). When spectra are integrated, summation of the&#10;tall-and-narrow bare dark peaks centered at slightly different&#10;frequencies results mostly in widening of the observed peak, while&#10;summation of short-and-wide dressed bright peaks results more in&#10;increasing the height of the observed peak. As a result, at 2 K, the&#10;intensity of the dressed bright peak is higher than that of the bare&#10;dark peak in the presence of spectral diffusion (Fig.&#10;\[Fig:Spectrum\]c), although it was relatively lower in the absence of&#10;spectral diffusion (Fig. \[Fig:Spectrum\]a).&#10;&#10;Next, we calculate the luminescence decay dynamics for specific case of&#10;CdSe quantum dots. To calculate time-dependence of luminescence&#10;intensity detected by the detector (Eq. \[eq:Intensity\_versus\_time\]),&#10;initial populations where are in the same proportion as pumping rates&#10;used while calculating spectrum, and coefficients , and in Eq.&#10;\[eq:Intensity\_versus\_time\] are evaluated using Eqs.&#10;\[eq:Populations\_versus\_time\]-\[eq:IntensityCoefficients\] from&#10;Methods section. Figure \[Fig:Lifetime\]a plots quantum dot luminescence&#10;signal, (Eq. \[eq:Intensity\_versus\_time\]), as a function of time&#10;after pulsed excitation at time 0, for different temperatures. At 2 K,&#10;when 1, most of the population decays non-radiatively because of the&#10;fast phonon relaxation due to (Eq.&#10;\[eq:EigenValues\_DecayRate\_simplified\]), and therefore, the intensity&#10;drops quickly initially and then it decays radiatively at a slow rate&#10;(at 2 K, , Fig. \[Fig:Lifetime\]b). As temperature increases, radiative&#10;decay from the dressed bright state starts to compete against the phonon&#10;relaxation, which appears as a reduction in the initial drop and early&#10;onset of the slower decay of the photoluminescence intensity. This&#10;behavior is also seen in Fig. \[Fig:Lifetime\]c that plots variation of&#10;coefficients , and of Eq. \[eq:Intensity\_versus\_time\] with&#10;temperature. At 20 K, three decay rates are distinctly visible: the&#10;fastest decay is due to phonon-assisted non-radiative relaxation ; the&#10;next is which has dominant contribution from radiative relaxation of&#10;dressed bright state (); the slowest one is which is radiative&#10;relaxation of dressed dark state and is temperature-independent. The&#10;predictions of our model match well with the experiments , and provide&#10;an explanation for the long standing question about the existence of&#10;microsecond-scale component of decay. Our calculations also explain&#10;(Fig. \[Fig:Lifetime\]b) experimental observation of&#10;temperature-independent radiative lifetime below 2 K . We calculate&#10;decay curves for another set of initial conditions, in which the bare&#10;dark exciton is not pumped and observe similar behavior as in Fig.&#10;\[Fig:Lifetime\]a (Supporting Information Fig. S4), showing that the&#10;behavior of the model is not too sensitive to the initial conditions.&#10;&#10;Many experimental investigations of decay dynamics of colloidal quantum&#10;dots have reported an S-shaped temperature dependence for the long-time&#10;component of decay . To further validate the findings of our model, we&#10;plot effective long lifetime, defined as as a function of temperature in&#10;Fig. \[Fig:Lifetime\]d, and observe an S-shaped dependence that matches&#10;well with the experimental data.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="Multiple features observed in photoluminescence spectrum and&#10;photoluminescence decay of colloidal quantum dots at low temperatures (&#10;20 K) have not been explained by a single model. These include: first,&#10;microsecond-scale lifetime attributed to the dark exciton; second,&#10;temperature-dependence of the photoluminescence decay; third, existence&#10;of the lowest energy peak in the three-peak spectrum and the radiative&#10;decay channel for the dark exciton that gives rise to the zero-LO phonon&#10;line in the spectrum; fourth, the temperature-dependence of the&#10;photoluminescence spectrum.&#10;&#10;Our theoretical model provides a physical explanation for all four&#10;intriguing features observed in photoluminescence spectrum and&#10;photoluminescence decay. Based on experimental evidences from many works&#10;, we propose that the excitonic states and a confined acoustic phonon&#10;mode are in strong coupling leading to formation of dressed dark and&#10;dressed bright states. Our calculations show that the microsecond-scale&#10;excitonic lifetime observed at low temperatures in experiments is the&#10;radiative lifetime of the dressed dark state. Our model also accounts&#10;for interaction of quantum dot with bulk phonon modes that impart&#10;temperature-dependent behavior. Our model provides a physical&#10;explanation for the S-shaped temperature dependence for the long-time&#10;component of decay. Further, the two dressed states along with the bare&#10;dark exciton state are the eigenenergy states of the coupled system,&#10;which appear in the photoluminescence spectrum at 2-3 K . This explains&#10;the experimentally observed three-peaked photoluminescence spectrum .&#10;Our model clarifies that the middle peak is the zero-LO phonon line of&#10;the dressed dark state of the strongly coupled exciton-phonon system,&#10;and therefore has a partial bright character that provides it a&#10;radiative decay channel. Finally, our model, with inclusion of spectral&#10;diffusion, closely predicts the temperature-dependence of the spectrum,&#10;including the observation that the peaks merge with each other around 20&#10;K .&#10;&#10;Our model presents a significant advance over the existing and widely&#10;used theoretical model, which is based on thermal distribution of&#10;population via acoustic phonons between the dark and the bright exciton&#10;states . This existing model does not explain the microsecond lifetime&#10;of the dark exciton, and the presence of the lowest energy peak in the&#10;three-peak spectrum and the origin of radiative decay channel for the&#10;dark exciton. The results from our model also indicate that the existing&#10;model does not characterize the middle peak sufficiently. While the&#10;middle peak is the zero-LO phonon line of the dark exciton, as&#10;characterized by the existing model, it is dressed dark state due to&#10;coupling between exciton and confined acoustic phonon mode, which our&#10;model predicts.&#10;&#10;In our model, we assumed initial conditions that the phononic state and&#10;the excitonic states combined are equally pumped to closely match the&#10;experimental results. However, changing the initials conditions will not&#10;affect the overall conclusions of our model. We assumed that spectral&#10;diffusion was linearly dependent on temperature; we also found that&#10;changing the relationship to Boltzmann distribution did not affect the&#10;conclusions. The precise relation is not known; however it is likely&#10;that diffusion will increase monotonically with temperature, and any&#10;such dependence is likely to give qualitatively similar results (for&#10;example, the merging of the dressed peaks at higher temperatures). The&#10;numbers used in our calculations were taken from CdSe quantum dots as&#10;these are the most studied; however, short exciton lifetime at low&#10;temperatures has been observed in a variety of colloidal quantum dots .&#10;&#10;In our model, we have not accounted for LO-phonon; it can easily be&#10;incorporated into this model as an additional, independent decay channel&#10;for the dark exciton (this should not affect other conclusions). The&#10;observed exciton lifetime at low temperatures has also been found to&#10;depend on size of the quantum dot; it can be incorporated in our model&#10;by including size-dependence of parameters like exciton-phonon coupling,&#10;exciton-phonon detuning, and intrinsic exciton decay rates. The model&#10;can be extended to higher temperatures by including the higher manifolds&#10;of the dressed states ladder. Our model provides a general framework on&#10;which these additional mechanisms can be easily added to provide a&#10;detailed description of the behaviors of colloidal quantum dots.">
