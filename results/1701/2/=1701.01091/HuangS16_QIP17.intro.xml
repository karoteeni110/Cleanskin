  <outline text="The problem and the motivation" _note="Cryptographic hash functions are a fundamental primitive used widely in&#10;today’s cryptographic systems. They are considered “workhorses of modern&#10;cryptography”[^1] For simplicity, we focus our discussions on&#10;[KEYLESS]{} (cryptographic) hash functions, each of which is an&#10;efficiently computable function from some message space to some [DIGEST&#10;SPACE]{}  . Ideally, we want the hash function to have the following&#10;properties. First, the digest should be much shorter than the message.&#10;Depending on applications, the following security properties are&#10;desirable . (1) [COLLISION RESISTANT]{}: It is computationally&#10;infeasible to find a “collision”, i.e., two distinct messages and , such&#10;that . (2) [PREIMAGE RESISTANCE]{}: It is computationally infeasible to&#10;invert . (3) [SECOND PREIMAGE RESISTANCE]{}: Given a message , it should&#10;be computational infeasible to with .&#10;&#10;Prominent examples of widely used cryptographic hash functions include&#10;SHA-256 and SHA-512, part of the SHA-2 algorithms that were designed by&#10;NSA and are US Federal Standards. These algorithms are used in UNIX and&#10;LINUX for secure password hashing, in Bitcoin for proof-of-work. As a&#10;motivating example, we consider how proof-of-work can be carried out&#10;through hash. Suppose that Alice receives a trove of valuable documents&#10;, and Bob claims that he was the person producing and sending it. To&#10;prove his claim, he sends Alice a tag , which supposedly is the result&#10;of applying a cryptographic hash function on . Alice simply checks if .&#10;Accept if yes, reject otherwise. By the collision resistance property,&#10;it is nearly impossible that Bob can produce without knowing .&#10;&#10;In practice, there may be information leakage of the message over time&#10;due to information transmission, adversarial attacks, etc. Therefore, it&#10;is rather desirable if the hash function is resilient against&#10;information leakage. We ask: how many bits about the message can be&#10;leaked before the adversary is able to forge the tag easily?&#10;&#10;Cleary, , since if the tag itself is known to the adversary, he does not&#10;need to know more about to pass the verification. This is rather&#10;disappointing, since is typically much smaller than . We then ask: what&#10;if a quantum tag is used instead? If the leakage is quantum, by the same&#10;reasoning, remains a trivial and rather lower upper-bound on . This&#10;leads us to our central question: [CAN A QUANTUM HASH FUNCTION BE MUCH&#10;MORE RESILIENT TO [CLASSICAL]{} LEAKAGE?]{}&#10;&#10;[^1]: Bob Schneier,&#10;    &lt;https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2004/08/cryptanalysis_of_md5.html&gt;.">

  <outline text="Quantum cryptographic hash functions" _note="By a “quantum hash function,” we simply mean a classical-to-quantum&#10;encoding that maps to a pure -qubit state . In a seminal paper, Buhrman&#10;et al.  introduced the notion of [QUANTUM FINGERPRINTING]{}. In their&#10;most general form, a quantum fingerprinting is the following.&#10;&#10;\[def:qfinger\] A function is a (generalized) quantum fingerprinting&#10;where .&#10;&#10;We use the convention that represent the projector for the pure state .&#10;If one replaces the predicate by the fidelity , one sees that precisely&#10;quantify the extent of collision resistance. For concreteness, we define&#10;what we mean by quantum cryptographic hash function as follows. For a&#10;function , we say is negligible in if for all and all sufficiently large&#10;.&#10;&#10;\[def:qhash\] A quantum fingerprinting is a [QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH&#10;FUNCTION]{} if .&#10;&#10;We note that while classical cryptographic hash functions necessarily&#10;rely on computational assumptions for security, their quantum&#10;counterparts can achieve the three security properties (1-3)&#10;information-theoretically. We now proceed to formulate our leakage&#10;problem precisely. We consider average case security and model classical&#10;side-channel information using a classical-classical (c-c) state, called&#10;the [SIDE INFORMATION STATE]{}, on . Here is uniformly distributed and&#10;represents the side information. The largest probability of correctly&#10;guessing conditioned on is . The [CONDITIONAL MIN-ENTROPY]{} is . We&#10;quantify the amount of leakage by .&#10;&#10;The adversary is given the sub-system and creates a classical-quantum&#10;(cq) state , called the [FORGERY STATE]{}, through local quantum&#10;operations on . The [VERIFICATION SCHEME]{} for is the following&#10;measurement on : . The probability of the forgery state to pass the&#10;verification scheme is . Given the leakage , the optimal passing&#10;probability of a forgery state is denoted by . We can now define&#10;security precisely.&#10;&#10;A quantum cryptographic hash function is said to be [-RESILIENT AGAINST&#10;BITS OF CLASSICAL LEAKAGE]{} if for all forgery state obtained from bits&#10;of side information, the probability of passing the verification scheme&#10;. If no is specified, it is assumed that .">

  <outline text="Main Result" _note="We show that quantum cryptographic hash functions can be extremely&#10;resilient to classical leakage. Our main theorem is informally stated&#10;below.&#10;&#10;\[thm:main\] For all and , all quantum cryptographic hash functions are&#10;resilient against bits of classical leakage.&#10;&#10;Buhrman et al.  showed that for all and , there exists a quantum&#10;fingerprinting for for which explicit constructions can be derived&#10;from . We thus have the following corollary.&#10;&#10;For all , , and , there exist efficient quantum cryptographic hash&#10;functions resilient to leaking bits of information.&#10;&#10;One drawback of the verification scheme is that the verifier has to get&#10;access to full information about the original message in order to&#10;perform the verification. In some cases this would be a heavy burden on&#10;the verifier. One natural question to ask is that if it is possible to&#10;develop a lightweighted verification scheme where the verifier does not&#10;need to read the whole message. More formally, let the verifier now&#10;receive qubits of [ADVICE STATE]{} and bits of the [ FORGERY STATE]{}&#10;provided by the adversary. An verification scheme would then be a joint&#10;measurement on the advice state together with the forgery state. This&#10;generalizes the original verification where and .&#10;&#10;Out next result shows that, by increasing the hash a little bit we can&#10;dramatically reduce the size of system needed by the verifier:&#10;&#10;For all , fix . There exists a verification scheme acting on qubits,&#10;together with an ensemble of -qubit states such that&#10;&#10;Arunachalam et al.  showed that copies of a quantum cryptographic hash&#10;based on linear codes is necessary to recover the original -bit&#10;classical message, regardless of the length of the hash itself. Our&#10;result shows the complimentary aspect that only copies are sufficient to&#10;ensure that the prover holds the classical message.&#10;&#10;Our central technical result is the following. Recall that is the&#10;optimal guessing probability of the message conditioned on the -bit side&#10;information.&#10;&#10;\[lem:sep\] For any quantum fingerprinting and any leakage of classical&#10;bits, the probability of the forgery state passing the verification&#10;scheme satisfies&#10;&#10;This implies that by considering the two cheating strategies of guessing&#10;first (then applying ) and using a fixed fingerprint state.&#10;Consequently, when , the above inequality means that is negligible if&#10;and only if is negligible.&#10;&#10;Since is the threshold for to be non-negligible, the&#10;bounds (\[eqn:equiv\]) show for quantum cryptographic hash functions,&#10;the leakage resilience can approach the [MAXIMUM]{} of bits.&#10;&#10;One counterpart of this result is shown in , saying that copies of&#10;quantum fingerprints would be necessary for an adversary to recover the&#10;original message with non-negligible probability. Thus, the quantum&#10;cryptographic hash functions based on fingerprinting have the following&#10;property: The hash itself is efficiently computable, but it is&#10;information-theoretically resilient to recovery of the message from the&#10;hash (which requires copies of the hash) and to recovery of the hash&#10;from partial information of the message.">

  <outline text="Implications on quantum-proof randomness extraction" _note="Our result reveals some stark contrast between quantum and classical&#10;side information. This difference shows the difficulty for establishing&#10;the quantum security of classical-proof extractors. Roughly speaking, a&#10;randomness extractor is a randomized algorithm which turns a weakly&#10;random source into near uniform . These are fundamental objects with a&#10;wide range of applications in computational complexity, cryptography,&#10;and other areas . In particular, they accomplish the important tasks of&#10;privacy amplication , by decoupling the correlation between the output&#10;and the side information.&#10;&#10;A major open problem in randomness extraction is whether every&#10;classical-proof randomness extractor for min-entropy sources is secure&#10;against quantum adversaries with comparable amount but quantum side&#10;information. Loss of parameter is already shown to be inevitable in ,&#10;but possibilities still remain in the case where the ranges of&#10;parameters are relavant to most typical applications.&#10;&#10;If all quantum side information can be constructed from a comparable&#10;amount of classical side information, we would have resolved this major&#10;problem positively. Our result shows that this approach would&#10;necessarily fail. For details, see Section \[sec:re\].&#10;&#10;There exists a family of classical-quantum states with arbitrarily small&#10;amount of quantum side information, yet these quantum states cannot be&#10;approximately constructed from classical side information that is almost&#10;a perfect copy of the classical message.">

  <outline text="Sketch of Proofs" _note="To prove Separation Lemma \[lem:sep\], we first answered the following&#10;question (see Section \[sec:cgp\]): [GIVEN A C-Q STATE, HOW MUCH&#10;CLASSICAL SIDE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO APPROXIMATE IT UP TO A GIVEN&#10;ERROR ?]{} It turns out that this quantity, denoted by the CONVERSION&#10;PARAMETER, can be simplified to a fairly nice expression. An important&#10;step is to show (in Lemma \[lem:ccsimp\]) that classical information can&#10;without loss of generality be identifying a subset of the messages, and&#10;conditioned on this information, the messages are uniformly distributed&#10;on that subset. At the end, the proof reduces to estimating the operator&#10;norm of , where ’s are projections to the fingerprint states, thus&#10;pairwise almost orthogonal. Cotlar-Stein Lemma gives us the desired&#10;bound.">

  <outline text="Related works." _note="As mentioned above, Buhrman et al.  introduced the notion and provide&#10;the constructions of quantum fingerprinting. The application they&#10;focused on is for message identification. For our cryptographic&#10;applications, we are primarily interested in instances of a negligible&#10;fidelity. They did not discuss properties of quantum fingerprinting in&#10;an adversarial context like ours. That quantum fingerprinting satisfies&#10;the security properties of cryptographic hash functions was observed and&#10;explored by .&#10;&#10;Side-channel attack is a major paradigm studied in the classical&#10;information security and cryptography community due to its high level of&#10;threat in practice . Side-channel key recovery attack has in particular&#10;drawn much attention . However, these classical works address problems&#10;that necessarily require computational assumptions and many other works&#10;focus on the hardware aspects. To the best of our knowledge, this work&#10;appears to be the first studying information theoretical security of&#10;quantum cryptography against classical side-channel attack.">
