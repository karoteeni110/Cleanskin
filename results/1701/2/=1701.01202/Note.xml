<outline text="Introduction" _note="Ringel introduced the Hall algebra of a finite dimensional algebra over&#10;a finite field. By the works of Ringel and Green , the twisted Hall&#10;algebra, called the Ringel–Hall algebra, of a finite dimensional&#10;hereditary algebra provides a realization of the positive (negative)&#10;part of the corresponding quantum group. In order to obtain a Hall&#10;algebra description of the entire quantum group, one considers the Hall&#10;algebras of triangulated categories (for example, , , ). In , Xiao gave&#10;a realization of the whole quantum group by constructing the Drinfeld&#10;double of the extended Ringel–Hall algebra of any hereditary algebra.&#10;&#10;In 2013, Bridgeland considered the Hall algebra of 2-cyclic complexes of&#10;projective modules over a finite dimensional hereditary algebra , and&#10;achieved an algebra, called the (reduced) Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of ,&#10;by taking some localization and reduction. He proved that there is an&#10;algebra embedding from the Ringel–Hall algebra of to its Bridgeland’s&#10;Hall algebra. Moreover, the quantum group associated with A can be&#10;embedded into the reduced Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of . This provides a&#10;realization of the full quantum group by Hall algebras. In , Bridgeland&#10;stated without proof that the Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of each finite&#10;dimensional hereditary algebra is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of&#10;its extended Ringel–Hall algebra. Later on, Yanagida proved this&#10;statement in . With the purpose of generalizing Bridgeland’s&#10;construction to a bigger class of exact categories, Gorsky defined the&#10;so-called semi-derived Hall algebra of the category of bounded complexes&#10;of for each exact category satisfying certain finiteness conditions. In&#10;particular, if every object in has finite projective resolution, he gave&#10;a similar construction to the category of 2-cyclic complexes of .&#10;Recently, inspired by the works of Bridgeland and Gorsky, Lu and Peng&#10;have generalized Bridgeland’s construction to any hereditary abelian&#10;category which may not have enough projectives, and defined an algebra&#10;for the category of 2-cyclic complexes of , called the modified&#10;Ringel–Hall algebra of . They also proved that the resulting algebra is&#10;isomorphic to the Drinfeld double Hall algebra of .&#10;&#10;The key step in the proof that the Bridgeland’s Hall algebra or modified&#10;Ringel–Hall algebra of a hereditary abelian category is isomorphic to&#10;its Drinfeld double Hall algebra is to check the (Drinfeld) commutator&#10;relations. The method used in is to make the summations on the left-hand&#10;and right-hand sides of the commutator relations symmetric by some&#10;analysis of the structure of the category of 2-cyclic complexes of&#10;projectives in , as well as some complicated calculations. It seems that&#10;the process of the proof is not too intuitive. While Lu and Peng gave a&#10;characterization of some coefficients in the commutator relations by&#10;introducing two sets, and obtained the proof by means of the coincidence&#10;of the cardinalities of these two sets. Nevertheless, their&#10;characterization is a bit complicated. In this note we use the&#10;associativity formula of Hall algebras to give a more intuitive and&#10;simpler proof that the Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of is isomorphic to its&#10;Drinfeld double Hall algebra. Similarly, based on , we give a&#10;simplification of the key step in the proof of Theorem 4.11 in .&#10;Explicitly, we prove the commutator relations therein by using the&#10;associativity formula of Hall algebras rather than Lemma 4.10 in .&#10;&#10;Let us fix some notations used throughout the paper. is always a finite&#10;field with elements and set . is always a finitary hereditary abelian&#10;-category with enough projectives unless otherwise stated, we also&#10;assume that the image of in the Grothendieck group is nonzero for any&#10;nonzero object in (cf. ).

Inspired by the works of Bridgeland and Gorsky , Lu and&#10;Peng introduced an algebra , called the [MODIFIED RINGEL–HALL ALGEBRA]{}&#10;of , with the purpose of generalizing Bridgeland’s construction to any&#10;hereditary abelian categories satisfying certain finiteness conditions.&#10;For unexplained notations (such as , and ) concerning the modified&#10;Ringel–Hall algebra we refer to .&#10;&#10;For any , we consider the action of the group on , which is defined by&#10;the following commutative diagram for any and .

In this&#10;note, we explicitly work out the coefficients in the summation via Hall&#10;numbers. While, Lu and Peng introduced orbit sets and express the&#10;coefficients by . For the conclusive part, we are reduced to use the&#10;associativity formula of Hall algebras, and Lu and Peng introduced once&#10;more two sets and give a characterization of the cardinalities of these&#10;sets (), then they are reduced to the equality of the cardinalities of&#10;these two sets. In some sense, we avoid computing the cardinalities of&#10;the sets defined by Lu and Peng, this work seems to be equivalent to the&#10;proof of the associativity of Hall algebras. However, the advantage of&#10;their proof is that we have better understanding of the essence of the&#10;coefficients in the commutator relation .">
