    <title> Breakdown of Nonlinear Elasticity in Stress-Controlled Thermal
Amorphous Solids</title>
    <abstract>In recent work it was clarified that amorphous solids under strain
control do not possess nonlinear elastic theory in the sense that the
shear modulus exists but nonlinear moduli exhibit sample to sample
fluctuations that grow without bound with the system size. More relevant
however for experiments are the conditions of stress control. In the
present Communication we show that also under stress control the shear
modulus exists but higher order moduli show unbounded sample to sample
fluctuation. The unavoidable consequence is that the characterization of
stress-strain curves in experiments should be done with a
stress-dependent shear modulus rather than with nonlinear expansions. </abstract>
