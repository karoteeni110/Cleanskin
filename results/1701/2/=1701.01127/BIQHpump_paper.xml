    <title>Bosonic integer quantum Hall effect as topological pumping</title>
    <abstract>Based on a quasi-one-dimensional limit of quantum Hall states on a thin
torus, we construct a model of interaction-induced topological pumping
which mimics the Hall response of the bosonic integer quantum Hall
(BIQH) state. The quasi-one-dimensional counterpart of the BIQH state is
identified as the Haldane phase composed of two-component bosons which
form effective spin- degrees of freedom. An adiabatic change between the
Haldane phase and trivial Mott insulators constitutes [OFF-DIAGONAL]{}
topological pumping in which the translation of the lattice potential
for one component induces a current in the other. The mechanism of this
pumping is interpreted in terms of changes in polarizations between
symmetry-protected quantized values. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Adiabatic change of parameters of a Hamiltonian sometimes causes&#10;nontrivial effects which cannot be found in its instantaneous ground&#10;state. Topological pumping, originally proposed by Thouless, provides a&#10;prototypical example of such phenomena. Thouless considered a&#10;one-dimensional (1D) band insulator in a periodic lattice potential .&#10;Let us consider an adiabatic shift of the lattice potential parametrized&#10;by . Since the lattice potential is periodic, so is the Hamiltonian with&#10;respect to its parameter: . The one-particle quantum states in an energy&#10;band are then specified by the wave number and the parameter . When the&#10;lattice potential is adiabatically shifted by varying , the particles&#10;move with the lattice, and the Hamiltonian returns to its original form&#10;after a shift by one lattice spacing. The ground state also returns to&#10;the initial one as long as the particles stay in the same band. However,&#10;the change in the ground state during the cycle can cause a nonvanishing&#10;particle current. The total current over one cycle is given by the Chern&#10;number, which takes an integer and characterizes topologically distinct&#10;classes of the set of one-particle states defined in the plane. Hence&#10;the total current is quantized, and this phenomenon is called the&#10;topological Thouless pumping. If we identify the plane with the&#10;two-dimensional (2D) reciprocal space, we find that the Thouless pumping&#10;shares the same origin as the integer quantum Hall (QH) effect, in which&#10;the quantized pumping corresponds to the quantized Hall conductivity.&#10;Owing to its topological nature, the topological pumping is robust&#10;against small deformation of the pumping protocol, and can be realized&#10;by various types of cycles using lattice models. After almost 30 years&#10;since Thouless’s prediction, the topological pumping was finally&#10;realized experimentally by using ultracold atoms in optical&#10;superlattices, in which the periodic change of the lattice potential was&#10;created by the change of the phase of the standing wave potential. Other&#10;schemes of manipulating an optical superlattice for realizing the&#10;topological pumping have also been discussed.&#10;&#10;The integer QH effect and its 1D counterpart, the Thouless pumping, are&#10;composed of non-interacting free fermions. It is well known that in high&#10;magnetic fields, interactions between particles can generate highly&#10;entangled ground states and result in various QH states with fascinating&#10;features. For example, the fractional QH (FQH) state and its non-Abelian&#10;generalizations exhibit fractionally quantized Hall conductivity and&#10;host fractionalized excitations with exotic quantum statistics which&#10;differs from ordinary bosons and fermions. The FQH states are examples&#10;of topologically ordered states, and exhibit ground-state degeneracy if&#10;the system is put on a topologically nontrivial surface with nonzero&#10;genus, such as a torus.&#10;&#10;Other than the FQH states, strong correlations can create yet another&#10;interesting INTEGER QH state. The bosonic integer QH (BIQH) state, which&#10;is formed by two-component bosons with the total filling factor , is&#10;such an example. Since noninteracting bosons form a Bose-Einstein&#10;condensate in the ground state, QH states of bosons inevitably require&#10;interactions. Although the BIQH state does not exhibit any&#10;fractionalized excitation or topological ground-state degeneracy, it is&#10;strictly distinguished from a trivial phase as long as the U symmetry&#10;associated with the conservation of the total particle number is&#10;preserved. In this sense, the BIQH state is an example of a 2D&#10;symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of bosons, and there have&#10;been studies on its physical properties, physical models realizing it&#10;(particularly in cold-atom setups), exotic phase transitions out of it,&#10;its relationship to quantum spin liquid, and its generalizations. The&#10;Hall response of the BIQH state is described by the effective&#10;Chern-Simons theory where is the U gauge field which couples to the&#10;first (second) component of bosons. Here we assume that the number of&#10;particles is separately conserved in each component. From the effective&#10;theory , we can read off that a probe electric field for ONE component&#10;induces the quantized Hall response in THE OTHER. Such an “off-diagonal”&#10;response is a unique feature of the BIQH state, which we highlight in&#10;this paper.&#10;&#10;In this paper, we aim to construct nontrivial classes of topological&#10;pumping which correspond to QH states created by strong interactions. We&#10;first consider topological pumping which mimics the Hall response of the&#10;FQH states, and then focus on the case of the BIQH state. Based on a&#10;quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) limit of QH states, we can&#10;systematically construct strongly interacting models of topological&#10;pumping and thus naturally extend the connection between the topological&#10;pumping and the QH effect to interacting systems. We show that the&#10;quasi-1D limit of the BIQH state is given by the Haldane phase, which is&#10;a celebrated example of a SPT phase in one dimension. The mechanism of&#10;the resulting topological pumping is interpreted in terms of changes in&#10;polarizations between quantized values that correspond to two distinct&#10;gapped phases in the presence of the inversion symmetry. The obtained&#10;off-diagonal topological pumping intertwining two-component bosons&#10;provides novel interaction-induced topological pumping, and suggests an&#10;intriguing connection between the 2D topological phases and 1D gapped&#10;phases.&#10;&#10;The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \[fluxins\], we&#10;describe our idea for obtaining models of topological pumping&#10;systematically from QH states on a thin torus. We take the case of FQH&#10;states as examples, and explain that their thin-torus counterparts&#10;naturally give rise to fractional charge pumping. In Sec. \[ttl\], we&#10;construct a 1D lattice model that corresponds to the thin-torus limit of&#10;two-component bosons in a magnetic field. We then identify the Haldane&#10;state as the thin-torus counterpart of the BIQH state. In&#10;Sec. \[Berryphase\], the topological pumping which mimics the BIQH&#10;effect is described and interpreted in terms of changes in polarizations&#10;between symmetry-protected quantized values. Finally, we summarize our&#10;results in Sec. \[summary\].">

<outline text="Topological pumping as flux insertion through a thin torus[fluxins]" _note="In this section, we explain our idea for obtaining models of 1D&#10;topological pumping systematically from a so-called thin-torus limit of&#10;2D QH states. Let us consider a bosonic or fermionic system composed of&#10;particles of charge and mass in a uniform magnetic field on a 2D torus&#10;of size . We take the Landau gauge and assume . The total number of flux&#10;quanta piercing the system is , where is the magnetic length. The&#10;filling factor is defined as . The single-particle spectrum is given by&#10;the Landau levels , where is the cyclotron energy. The eigenstates in&#10;each level are -fold degenerate, and labeled in the present gauge by the&#10;wave number in the direction. In particular, the lowest-Landau-level&#10;(LLL) wave functions are given by This wavefunction is localized around&#10;with a width in the direction, and delocalized in the direction (see the&#10;left panel of Fig. \[fig\_ttl\]). Here, is the spacing between&#10;neighboring wavefunctions, and used as an effective “lattice constant”&#10;later.&#10;&#10;In Laughlin’s flux insertion argument, the quantized Hall conductivity&#10;can be derived as a response to an adiabatic insertion of a flux quantum&#10;through the torus. The effect of flux insertion is expressed by a&#10;twisted boundary condition, which results in the replacement with .&#10;After inserting one flux quantum (), the Hamiltonian of the system goes&#10;back to its original form. However, each Landau-level orbital shifts its&#10;position by in the direction during this process. Hence, if some of the&#10;Landau levels are completely occupied and others are empty, the system&#10;exhibits the integer QH effect. The FQH effect is also understood in a&#10;similar manner by taking into account the topological ground-state&#10;degeneracy on the torus. In this case, the insertion of one flux quantum&#10;transfers the initial ground state to another degenerate ground state,&#10;and some integer multiple of flux quanta are required to go back to the&#10;initial ground state.&#10;&#10;Keeping this picture in mind, let us gradually decrease the length in&#10;the direction while keeping the total area fixed. By identifying the&#10;locations of the LLL orbitals as a lattice coordinate, the original 2D&#10;system can be viewed as an effective 1D lattice model. The effective&#10;model contains some long-range interactions, whose coefficients are&#10;given by interaction matrix elements with respect to the LLL orbitals on&#10;concerned sites. However, as we decrease , the lattice constant&#10;increases, and the LLL orbitals are mutually separated further.&#10;Interactions for longer distances are thus suppressed more rapidly in&#10;this process, and the physics for is expected to be dominated by a few&#10;interaction terms for short distances.&#10;&#10;If the ground state of a given QH state is smoothly changed without&#10;closing an excitation gap with decreasing , the ground state is expected&#10;to gradually acquire a 1D character owing to the suppression of&#10;interactions for long distances. We can then view the ground state on a&#10;thin torus as the 1D lattice counterpart of the QH state. It is then&#10;expected that the insertion of a flux quantum through the thin torus&#10;induces quantized current in the direction. This phenomenon can be&#10;viewed as the topological pumping in the 1D model.&#10;&#10;Let us illustrate the above idea using the simplest FQH state, the&#10;Laughlin state of fermions at . It was shown that with decreasing , the&#10;Laughlin state is smoothly deformed into a charge-density-wave (CDW)&#10;state in which every third site is occupied by a particle. Here,&#10;density-density interactions for nearest-neighbor and&#10;next-nearest-neighbor pairs of sites play a dominant role and stabilize&#10;the CDW state. If a flux quantum is adiabatically inserted through a&#10;thin torus, the LLL orbitals shift their positions by one lattice&#10;spacing , and the CDW ground state changes into another degenerate&#10;ground state as shown in Fig. \[fig\_ttl\]. The total current during&#10;this shift of the ground state is equal to if averaged in space; this&#10;corresponds to the fractional Hall conductivity of the Laughlin state.&#10;Hence, as expected, the flux insertion for the 1D counterpart of the FQH&#10;state results in fractional Thouless pumping. Similarly to Laughlin’s&#10;argument for the FQH effect, here the degeneracy of the ground states is&#10;essential in obtaining the fractional pumping.&#10;&#10;For a filling fraction with a denominator larger than , it is not clear&#10;whether the FQH state is adiabatically connected to a CDW state with&#10;decreasing . This is because in a thin torus, the density-density&#10;interactions that stabilize a CDW state can severely compete with other&#10;interaction terms in which two particles hop in a&#10;center-of-mass-conserving manner. However, if we keep only the&#10;density-density interactions and neglect other interaction terms, the&#10;system exhibits a CDW ground state with -fold degeneracy at every&#10;rational filing fraction (with and being coprime). The adiabatic shift&#10;of such a CDW state by one lattice spacing clearly results in fractional&#10;Thouless pumping. Similar schemes for realizing fractional pumping by&#10;CDW states have been discussed in literature, especially in connection&#10;with the “synthetic dimension” technique in cold atoms. In this&#10;technique, infinite-range interactions in the synthetic dimension&#10;stabilize CDW ground states. Although the topological pumping&#10;constructed here is just a translational operation of the entire system&#10;and seems to be somewhat trivial, we will see that the case of the BIQH&#10;state provides more nontrivial topological pumping.">

<outline text="Thin-torus limit of the bosonic integer quantum Hall state[ttl]" _note="Based on the correspondence between the QH state and the topological&#10;pumping described in the previous section, we here construct the&#10;thin-torus counterpart of the BIQH state. Let us start with&#10;two-component bosons in a uniform magnetic field on a torus described by&#10;the Hamiltonian where denotes the bosonic field operator for the -th&#10;component. We assume repulsive contact interactions between particles,&#10;and set for simplicity. The filling factor for each component is set to&#10;unity so that the total filling factor is given by . The system&#10;possesses the U(1)U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number&#10;conservation in each component. Through exact diagonalization analyses,&#10;it was shown that the BIQH state described by the effective Chern-Simons&#10;theory appears when the ratio of the intercomponent to intracomponent&#10;interactions, , is close to unity.&#10;&#10;Within the LLL approximation, the field operators are expanded as where&#10;annihilates a particle in the -th LLL orbital and satisfies the&#10;commutation relations and . To facilitate later discussions on&#10;topological pumping, we have introduced a magnetic flux which couples to&#10;the -th component so that the LLL wave function is given by the&#10;right-hand side of Eq. (\[LLLWF\]) with replaced by . Correspondingly,&#10;the positions of the LLL orbitals are shifted to in the -th component.&#10;Substituting the expansion (\[LLLexpansion\]) into the Hamiltonian&#10;(\[Hamil\]), we obtain We note that the interaction in this Hamiltonian&#10;preserves the center-of-mass position in the direction. The interaction&#10;matrix elements are calculated by using the LLL wave functions as&#10;&#10;where the sum is over the wave vector , is the modulo- Kronecker delta,&#10;and is a factor for fixing the double counting of some terms. If we take&#10;the limit (and thus ) while keeping fixed, these elements are given more&#10;simply by&#10;&#10;\[Vmn\_simple\]&#10;&#10;Let us first consider the case when no flux is inserted through the&#10;torus: . When we take the thin-torus limit , the only remaining&#10;interactions are on-site ones, which are the components of Eq. . We thus&#10;obtain where we ignore the constant kinetic energy of the LLL. The&#10;ground state of the thin-torus Hamiltonian (\[H\_ttl\]) is easily&#10;obtained. For , where the intracomponent interaction is dominant (), the&#10;ground state is the product state of Bose Mott insulators For , where&#10;the intercomponent interaction is dominant (), the ground states are&#10;ferromagnetic states if we fix only the total number of particles. If we&#10;fix the number of particles in each component, a phase separation&#10;occurs. The point , at which , is special—the on-site energy is the same&#10;for , leading to -fold degeneracy of the ground state. This macroscopic&#10;degeneracy in the thin-torus limit is lifted by fluctuations as we&#10;increase .&#10;&#10;To obtain a unique ground state at , we proceed away from the thin-torus&#10;limit by increasing and consider leading fluctuations. The next-leading&#10;interactions are the nearest-neighbor ones, which are , and terms. The&#10;term involves hopping of particles, while the other ones are of an&#10;electrostatic type. To discuss the competition of these terms, we&#10;restrict ourselves to the low-energy manifold of the Hilbert space&#10;spanned by the -fold degenerate ground states of Eq.  at . The&#10;thin-torus ground states and for also reside in this manifold. In this&#10;restricted subspace, in which the constraint is satisfied at every site,&#10;the operators satisfy the commutation relations of the SU(2) generators&#10;and have the fixed magnitude as is known in the Schwinger boson&#10;formalism. Here, is a set of Pauli matrices. The Hamiltonian can thus be&#10;written in terms of the spin- operators as where , , and . This has the&#10;form of the XXZ chain with a single-ion anisotropy. At , in particular,&#10;since the effective Hamiltonian is given by the spin- antiferromagnetic&#10;Heisenberg chain where we set . This Hamiltonian has a non-degenerate&#10;ground state known as the Haldane state. The macroscopic degeneracy of&#10;the ground state of Eq.  is thus lifted by the leading fluctuations.&#10;&#10;At this stage, it is interesting to compare the phases of the spin-&#10;chain (\[H\_XXZ\]) with the phase diagram of the original 2D system. The&#10;two-component bosons (\[Hamil\]) at in two dimensions show a couple of&#10;phases when varying the interaction ratio (Fig. \[fig\_phase\]). When is&#10;small, the two components are nearly decoupled and form the Moore-Read&#10;states independently. In the opposite limit, when is large (numerically&#10;), the 2D ground state exhibits a phase separation. The BIQH state&#10;appears around intervening the two limiting cases. Our mapping to a spin&#10;chain (\[H\_XXZ\]) qualitatively reproduces these phases as summarized&#10;in Fig. \[fig\_phase\]. When is sufficiently small, the single-ion&#10;anisotropy is the most dominant term in Eq. (\[H\_XXZ\]). For , we have&#10;, and the ground state is a large- state, which is equivalent to the&#10;doubled Mott insulators in Eq. . For a single-component Bose gas at the&#10;filling factor , it was shown that the ground state in the thin-torus&#10;limit is given by a Bose Mott insulator , and then two CDW states and&#10;become nearly degenerate with the ground state as we increase ; these&#10;three states naturally evolve into the threefold degenerate ground&#10;states of the bosonic Moore-Read state on a 2D torus. Similarly, the&#10;doubled Mott insulators in Eq.  are expected to evolve into the doubled&#10;Moore-Read states found in the 2D system. For , we have and , and the&#10;spin chain exhibits ferromagnetic ground states as in Eq. ; if the total&#10;magnetization of the system is fixed at zero, a phase separation occurs&#10;as found in the 2D system. As we increase , the Haldane phase appears&#10;between the large- and ferromagnetic phases in the spin-chain model, and&#10;its range along the axis gradually increases. Owing to the uniqueness of&#10;the ground state and high entanglement between the two components, it is&#10;natural to speculate that this phase evolves into the BIQH phase in the&#10;2D case. It is worth noting that our mapping to a spin chain can be&#10;generalized to the case of arbitrary integer , resulting in a spin-&#10;version of Eq. . Then the Haldane conjecture for the Heisenberg chain&#10;suggests the emergence of gapped (gapless) states for even (odd) . The&#10;gapless state at is expected to evolve into a gapless composite fermion&#10;liquid in the 2D case.&#10;&#10;Next, let us consider the thin-torus limit in the case when some fluxes&#10;are inserted through the torus. Since the Hamiltonian (\[H\_LLL\])&#10;depends on the fluxes only through , we set () and without loss of&#10;generality. In this case, since the flux causes lattice mismatch between&#10;the two components, the only remaining interaction in the limit is the&#10;on-site intracomponent one , and the intercomponent interactions&#10;completely disappear. The ground state is thus the doubled Mott&#10;insulators (\[Mott\]) at any . We note that this fact does not&#10;contradict the above identification of the BIQH state with the Haldane&#10;phase, since the flux insertion breaks the inversion symmetry of the&#10;system (except at ) and thus there is no clear distinction between the&#10;Haldane phase and the Bose Mott insulator. In the next section, we show&#10;that the change in the ground state during the adiabatic flux insertion&#10;is related to the Hall response of the BIQH state, leading to the&#10;off-diagonal topological pumping in the quasi-1D system.">

<outline text="Off-diagonal topological pumping in the thin-torus limit [Berryphase]" _note="In this section, we describe the 1D topological pumping which mimics the&#10;BIQH effect, and thereby reinterpret the fact that the thin-torus&#10;counterpart of the BIQH state is the Haldane phase. We start from the&#10;two-component Bose system on a 2D torus, and consider its Hall response.&#10;As discussed in Sec. \[ttl\], we introduce a magnetic flux through the&#10;torus, which results in the twisted boundary condition for the -th&#10;component in the direction. We also introduce a magnetic flux through&#10;the other direction of the torus, which results in the analogous twisted&#10;boundary condition in the direction. Then the Hall response of the -th&#10;component to the flux insertion for the -th component () can be&#10;expressed by the many-body Chern number where is the many-body ground&#10;state for the twists and for the -th and -th components in the and&#10;directions, respectively, while the other twisting angles are set to&#10;zero. The Chern-Simons theory (\[CS\]) of the BIQH effect corresponds to&#10;and . These responses result in the off-diagonal topological pumping in&#10;the thin-torus limit as we see below.&#10;&#10;Hereafter we focus on the responses corresponding to and . These can be&#10;analyzed by setting and adiabatically changing the pumping parameter&#10;from to . The Hall current in the direction is identified as the pumped&#10;charge. For fixed , it is useful to introduce the Berry phase which is&#10;associated with the change in the ground state when is adiabatically&#10;changed from to . The Chern number (\[Chern\]) can then be rewritten as&#10;In this expression, the quantized Hall response, or equivalently the&#10;quantized charge pumping can be understood as () change in the Berry&#10;phase over the pumping process.&#10;&#10;A more intuitive understanding of the quantized pumping can be gained by&#10;introducing the polarization. To introduce it, we define where . This is&#10;convenient in describing the center-of-mass position of the particles in&#10;the -th component in the direction since the position is defined modulo&#10;under the periodic boundary condition. Within the LLL approximation, we&#10;can exploit the fact that the -th LLL orbital for the -th component is&#10;localized around in the direction (with larger spacing for smaller ),&#10;and approximate as This resembles the expectation value of the&#10;Lieb-Schultz-Mattis twist operator. The phase of gives the polarization&#10;Importantly, the polarization is directly related to the Berry phase as&#10;The Chern number can therefore be rewritten as the change in the&#10;polarization over the pumping cycle: The BIQH effect should thus&#10;correspond to the topological pumping with and .&#10;&#10;Let us now discuss in detail the topological pumping in the thin-torus&#10;limit of the BIQH state. The pumping protocol in the present case is not&#10;just the translation but involves the change of intercomponent&#10;interactions, in sharp contrast with the FQH cases discussed in Sec.&#10;\[fluxins\]. Since the Hamiltonian in the LLL basis is invariant under&#10;the combined operations of the spatial inversion and the interchange of&#10;two components , in Eq.  satisfies which indicates . Thus, implies and&#10;vice versa. Furthermore, by exploiting the invariance of the pumping&#10;protocol under the combined operations of the spatial inversion and time&#10;reversal , we find , from which we obtain . Thus, half of the expected&#10;changes in the polarizations over one cycle must occur during :&#10;&#10;To discuss the variation of the polarizations as functions of , it is&#10;important to notice that the system possesses the spatial inversion&#10;symmetry at and . Therefore, the polarization must be quantized to or at&#10;these values of . It is known that in the presence of the inversion&#10;symmetry, a change in the polarization between these quantized values in&#10;general signals a phase transition. The polarization can therefore be&#10;used as an order parameter for detecting 1D topological phases protected&#10;by the inversion symmetry. Similar results can also be obtained through&#10;the quantization of the Berry phase. At , the thin-torus limit of the&#10;BIQH state is given by the Haldane state as discussed in Sec. \[ttl\];&#10;the Haldane phase is known to be a topological phase protected by the&#10;inversion symmetry, and has the polarizations At , the ground state in&#10;the thin-torus limit is given by the doubled Mott insulators; a direct&#10;calculation using Eq.  yields The Haldane phase and the doubled Mott&#10;insulators have the different polarizations and , and thus are distinct&#10;phases as long as the system possesses the inversion symmetry. The&#10;topological pumping can be interpreted as a process of connecting&#10;between the two phases smoothly by breaking the inversion symmetry. The&#10;idea of utilizing symmetry-breaking perturbations to connect between&#10;otherwise distinct gapped phases has also been used in other examples of&#10;topological pumping such as those based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger&#10;model, the spin-Peierls phases (equivalent to an interacting&#10;Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via the Jordan-Wigner transformation), and&#10;the Haldane insulator phase of an extended Bose-Hubbard model. We note&#10;that the polarizations in Eqs.  and are consistent with the relations ;&#10;conversely, the relations require the appearance of topologically&#10;distinct phases (in an inversion-symmetry-protected sense) at and . This&#10;gives an explanation on why the Haldane phase, a typical example of a 1D&#10;SPT phase, should emerge in the thin-torus limit of the BIQH state.&#10;&#10;Figure \[fig\_pump\] summarizes the process of the off-diagonal&#10;topological pumping in the thin-torus limit. The Haldane phase at can&#10;intuitively be described as localization of bosons at bonds of the&#10;lattice in a way similar to that of one-component bosons. By shifting&#10;the lattice for the first component, the inversion symmetry is broken&#10;and the ground state is smoothly deformed into the doubled Mott&#10;insulators at , and finally returns to the original ground state at .&#10;During this process, the bosons in the second component are pumped by&#10;one lattice spacing while the bosons in the first component stay around&#10;the same positions.&#10;&#10;Two remarks are in order. First, although the Haldane phase in the spin-&#10;chain can be protected not only by the inversion symmetry but also by&#10;the time-reversal or the spin rotation symmetry, the latter two&#10;symmetries do not protect the Haldane phase in the case of soft-core&#10;bosons as in the present case. This is because the spin- degrees of&#10;freedom required for the symmetry protection argument are not perfectly&#10;formed in the presence of fluctuations in on-site particle numbers. The&#10;inversion symmetry is thus the only symmetry that protects the Haldane&#10;phase at in the present case. The second remark is on the mapping to a&#10;spin- chain done in Sec. \[ttl\]. In the mapping from the thin-torus&#10;Hamiltonian to a spin chain in the FQH cases, the inversion symmetry is&#10;sometimes broken since the mapping process involves grouping of several&#10;neighboring sites starting from CDW ground states. In the case of the&#10;BIQH state, in contrast, the mapping to a spin chain retains the&#10;inversion symmetry of the original system, since each spin- degree of&#10;freedom is composed of bosons at the same site.&#10;&#10;To support the above picture of topological pumping, we have performed&#10;exact diagonalization calculations for the Hamiltonian with the number&#10;of flux quanta up to . We consider contact interactions with . Figure&#10;\[fig\_spec\_Ly\] presents the energy spectrum as a function of . The&#10;ground state is found to remain in the sector with zero pseudomomentum,&#10;indicating that the BIQH state in two dimensions is smoothly deformed&#10;into the Haldane state in the thin-torus limit. For , the energy gap&#10;above the ground state agrees well with the finite-size energy gap of&#10;the spin- Heisenberg chain (dashed lines) calculated by KOBEPACK.&#10;Reflecting the large ground-state degeneracy in the thin-torus limit, a&#10;large number of eigenenergies collapse onto the ground-state energy with&#10;decreasing . For , the energy gap stays around a constant value,&#10;indicating the convergence to a 2D system. Figure \[fig\_pol\_phi\]&#10;presents the polarizations , the amplitudes of the twist operators, and&#10;the energy spectrum as functions of the pumping parameter . The ground&#10;state is found to remain in the zero-pseudomomentum sector in this&#10;process also. The calculated polarizations smoothly connect between&#10;Eqs.  and for the Haldane state () and the doubled Mott insulators ().&#10;While the polarization of the first component stays around , the second&#10;component shows over the cycle, clearly signaling the off-diagonal&#10;topological pumping. As we decrease , long-range interactions are&#10;suppressed and the system gradually acquires a 1D character.&#10;Correspondingly, the change in the polarization becomes sharper in the&#10;quasi-1D limit. A rapid change in the center-of-mass position (and thus&#10;the polarization) has also been observed in 1D topological pumping. When&#10;the rapid crossover from the Haldane state to the doubled Mott&#10;insulators occurs, the energy gap becomes small and the amplitudes of&#10;the twist operators decrease. This indicates the increase in the&#10;localization length of the many-body wavefunction in this regime—while&#10;converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit in 1D gapped systems, its&#10;value can be suppressed when the system size is smaller than or&#10;comparable to the localization length. This behavior can be explained by&#10;the suppression of on-site particle number fluctuations when decreasing&#10;: If such fluctuations are completely absent, the pumping cycle is&#10;described by the spin- chain model , in which the Haldane phase and the&#10;doubled Mott insulators cannot be connected without closing a gap.">

<outline text="Summary[summary]" _note="In summary, we have constructed strongly interacting models of&#10;topological pumping by taking the thin-torus limit of 2D QH states. The&#10;thin-torus limit of the FQH states is given by CDW ground states;&#10;adiabatically connecting between degenerate CDW ground states gives the&#10;fractional Thouless pumping. As a more nontrivial example, we have&#10;constructed topological pumping which corresponds to the BIQH effect of&#10;two-component bosons. The quasi-1D counterpart of the BIQH state is&#10;identified as the Haldane phase, and adiabatically connecting between&#10;the topological Haldane phase and the trivial doubled Mott insulators&#10;constitutes the off-diagonal topological pumping. We have elucidated the&#10;nature of the topological pumping via the change in the polarizations&#10;between inversion-symmetry-protected quantized values. Since the idea of&#10;connecting between the Haldane and trivial phases by&#10;inversion-symmetry-breaking perturbations does not depend on the details&#10;of the system, the obtained off-diagonal topological pumping should not&#10;be limited to the thin-torus model considered in this paper. While the&#10;time-reversal symmetry is broken in QH states and related topological&#10;pumping, it is an intriguing direction to construct a bosonic version of&#10;time-reversal-symmetric pumping which may correspond to 2D bosonic&#10;topological insulators.&#10;&#10;We are grateful to Masaaki Nakamura, Ippei Danshita, Masahito Ueda, and&#10;Norio Kawakami for helpful discussions.
