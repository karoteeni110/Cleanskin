    <title>Quantum oscillations in metallic SbTeSe topological insulator</title>
    <abstract>We have studied the magnetotransport properties of the metallic, -type
SbTeSe which is a topological insulator. Magnetoresistance shows
Shubnikov de Haas oscillations in fields above =15 T. The maxima/minima
positions of oscillations measured at different tilt angles with respect
to the direction align with the normal component of field cos, implying
the existence of a 2D Fermi surface in SbTeSe. The value of the Berry
phase determined from a Landau level fan diagram is very close to 0.5,
further suggesting that the oscillations result from topological surface
states. From Lifshitz-Kosevich analyses, the position of the Fermi level
is found to be =250 meV, above the Dirac point. This value of is almost
3 times as large as that in our previous study on the BiSeTe topological
insulator; however, it still touches the tip of the bulk valence band.
This explains the metallic behavior and hole-like bulk charge carriers
in the SbTeSe compound. </abstract>
