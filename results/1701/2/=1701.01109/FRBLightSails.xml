    <title>Fast Radio Bursts from Extragalactic Light Sails</title>
    <abstract>We examine the possibility that Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) originate from
the activity of extragalactic civilizations. Our analysis shows that
beams used for powering large light sails could yield parameters that
are consistent with FRBs. The characteristic diameter of the beam
emitter is estimated through a combination of energetic and engineering
constraints, and both approaches intriguingly yield a similar result
which is on the scale of a large rocky planet. Moreover, the optimal
frequency for powering the light sail is shown to be similar to the
detected FRB frequencies. These ‘coincidences’ lend some credence to the
possibility that FRBs might be artificial in origin. Other relevant
quantities, such as the characteristic mass of the light sail, and the
angular velocity of the beam, are also derived. By using the FRB
occurrence rate, we infer upper bounds on the rate of FRBs from
extragalactic civilizations in a typical galaxy. The possibility of
detecting fainter signals is briefly discussed, and the wait time for an
exceptionally bright FRB event in the Milky Way is estimated. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Ever since the first discovery of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) over a decade&#10;ago , there has been a great deal of interest in uncovering their&#10;origin. Currently, only 17 FRBs have been recorded, and a summary of&#10;their properties can be found in .[^1] Hypotheses put forward for FRBs&#10;range from supramassive neutron stars to gamma-ray bursts and stellar&#10;flares . Regardless of their actual origin, it is now widely accepted&#10;that most FRBs are at cosmological distances , particularly owing to the&#10;recent localization of the repeating FRB 121102 to a dwarf galaxy at a&#10;redshift of .&#10;&#10;The unusually high brightness temperature of FRB sources at cosmological&#10;distances implies that their radio emission mechanism must be coherent&#10;as known to exist in pulsars or human-made radio transmitters. Despite&#10;the diversity of explanations advanced for FRBs, the possibility that&#10;they may be of artificial origin has not been specifically investigated,&#10;apart from Section V of .&#10;&#10;In this Letter, we examine the possibility that FRBs are artificial&#10;beams[^2] which have been set up as beacons, or for driving light sails.&#10;The idea that extraterrestrial civilizations may be using radio beams&#10;(manifested as dispersed pulses) is certainly not a new one, as it dates&#10;back to the pioneering paper by . This idea was extended by researchers&#10;engaged in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), accounts&#10;of which can be found in and (see also ). In addition to traditional,&#10;radio-based SETI, many other approaches have been advanced for detecting&#10;alien civilizations .&#10;&#10;In Section \[SecConstraints\], we show that the parameters required for&#10;generating artificial beams (to possibly power light sails) are&#10;compatible with FRB constraints. We discuss the implications and&#10;predictions in Section \[SecImps\], and summarize our conclusions in&#10;Section \[SecConc\].&#10;&#10;[^1]: &lt;http://www.astronomy.swin.edu.au/pulsar/frbcat/&gt;&#10;&#10;[^2]: Alternatively, FRBs could also be pulsar beams .">

<outline text="Compatibility of Fast Radio Bursts and Beams" _note="We start by examining whether some of the major FRB constraints are&#10;consistent with the assumption of artificial beams, and then explore the&#10;possibility that these beams may be used to power light sails.">
  <outline text="FRB constraints and requirements" _note="We begin by denoting the distance of the beam source from the Earth by .&#10;One of the primary OBSERVABLE parameters for FRBs is the dispersion&#10;measure (DM), defined through a line-of-sight integral, of the mean&#10;number density of free electrons . Ignoring contributions from the&#10;source, its host galaxy and the Milky Way, one may adopt the mean&#10;comoving electron density for the intergalactic medium (IGM), . For&#10;simplicity, we assume that the FRB redshifts are , and drop the redshift&#10;factors in the context of our order-of-magnitude estimations.&#10;&#10;Most sources in the FRB catalog have DM values of order hundreds of cm&#10;pc. Using equation (\[DMexp\]), the distance can be estimated as, This&#10;distance is also consistent with more accurate estimates .&#10;&#10;Next, we suppose that the beam has an angular width and a radiated&#10;(peak) power . The beam angle is expressible as some factor times the&#10;minimum value set by the diffraction limit, where is the frequency of&#10;the radiation, is the diameter of the beam emitter, and . The spectral&#10;flux density is given by, where is the spectral index needed for the&#10;relation and is the fraction of that is emitted as FRB radiation&#10;(radiative efficiency). We have assumed that and will use henceforth ,&#10;which implies that the artificial beams are BROADBAND. This unorthodox&#10;assumption, which is contrary to current terrestrial engineering design,&#10;will be central to our analysis, and does represent a significant&#10;conceptual challenge as to why civilizations would opt for broadband&#10;emission.[^1] The mean spectrum of FRBs is observed to be&#10;Gaussian-shaped, centered on a frequency of a few GHz . While being&#10;consistent with an artificial origin, this spectral shape is puzzling&#10;for pulsar or magnetar-like sources which are expected to show power-law&#10;spectra. Inverting equation (\[SpecFluxDens\]) yields,[^2] where the&#10;value of was normalized to the size of a large rocky planet for reasons&#10;explained below.&#10;&#10;First, let us suppose that extraterrestrial civilizations adopt the&#10;strategy of harnessing stellar energy to power the beams, thereby&#10;leading to where is the stellar irradiance, which should be close to the&#10;solar value in the habitable zone. The characteristic value of is found&#10;from (\[SpecFluxDens\]) and (\[SolPow\]) by substituting the typical&#10;values for all other parameters.&#10;&#10;As the aperture efficiency is , a fraction would be dissipated,&#10;amounting to a power per unit area of at the base of the emitter. If we&#10;assume that this excess heat is radiated away thermally, we get where is&#10;the surface temperature of the beamer. If the value of is too high,&#10;structural damage may follow. Hence, an upper bound on translates to a&#10;lower bound on . This leads us to and a comparison with (\[Power\]) and&#10;(\[SolPow\]) reveals that the same power estimate follows for cm. This&#10;represents the MINIMUM aperture diameter that is required to keep the&#10;system running. Note that the value of has been normalized to the&#10;boiling temperature of water, since it is widely used as a coolant in&#10;many beamer designs .&#10;&#10;Thus, we have shown that the characteristic value of cm is obtained in&#10;two very different ways, from energetic and engineering requirements.&#10;This already constitutes a remarkable coincidence. It is rendered more&#10;unique because of a third coincidence - the value is about twice the&#10;diameter of the Earth. In other words, the beam emitter is an object&#10;akin to a planet; more precisely, it lies fairly close to the boundary&#10;between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes . Another possibility worth&#10;considering is that the emitter could have been fashioned along the&#10;lines of the Stapledon-Dyson sphere .&#10;&#10;To summarize, we assumed that: (i) the emission was broadband, (ii)&#10;stellar energy was used to power the beams, and (iii) water was used as&#10;a coolant. A subtle distinction is that (i) relies on advanced&#10;technological choices (and underpinnings), whilst (ii) and (iii) are&#10;tantamount to statements about the availability and usefulness of raw&#10;materials.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Potential reasons include: (i) photon recycling for multiple&#10;    passes between the spacecraft and the planet. Each cycle yields the&#10;    standard kick but one gains by the number of cycles relative to the&#10;    case where the beam is dispersed after one reflection. The frequency&#10;    will be Doppler shifted in each pass, and once the spacecraft&#10;    reaches relativistic speeds the beam could be broadband because it&#10;    will include a mix of photons with different number of passes. (ii)&#10;    optimization of engineering and economic costs and functionality .&#10;&#10;[^2]: We obtain Eq. (20) in , although the factor of should be corrected&#10;    to in that paper.">

  <outline text="What is the purpose of these beams?" _note="The preceding discussion concluded that some of the major observables&#10;for FRBs are consistent with the idea that they may be manifestations of&#10;extragalactic beams. However, this still fails to answer the important&#10;question of why they would be extant.&#10;&#10;The first, and most immediate, possibility is that they serve the&#10;purpose of ‘beacons’, and are thus meant to broadcast the presence of&#10;alien civilizations. But, why would a civilization want to broadcast its&#10;presence? In , a variety of motives were considered, many of them of a&#10;sociological origin, such as a call for help, a desire to proclaim their&#10;technological achievements, etc. Although these possibilities cannot&#10;(and ought not) be ruled out, there are some inherent difficulties. They&#10;rely on complex (anthropocentric) reasons to some degree, and are thus&#10;not easily testable. Moreover, equation (\[Power\]) demonstrates that a&#10;power of is required, representing a fairly high expenditure. Hence, it&#10;seems rather implausible that this power would be expended on merely&#10;broadcasting a civilization’s existence.&#10;&#10;Instead, we consider the idea discussed in , further elaborated in and ,&#10;that these beams may power light sails. Suppose that a civilization&#10;wishes to construct a light sail capable of attaining relativistic&#10;speeds. In , it was argued that an efficient strategy for achieving the&#10;largest possible velocity for a limited acceleration value leads to&#10;where and are the maximum velocity and acceleration respectively, whilst&#10;is the Fresnel distance. The above expression takes advantage of the&#10;constant beam diameter in the near-field Fresnel region (with the sail&#10;size matching ) out to , where the beam enters the Fraunhofer&#10;(far-field) regime and starts to diverge with an opening angle . In&#10;Section \[SSecCons\], we argued that should be normalized in units of cm&#10;for a multitude of reasons; this amounts to . Using this value along&#10;with the characteristic values for and , we arrive at having normalized&#10;the acceleration in the anthropic units of gee. Remarkably, the above&#10;frequency coincides with characteristic value of GHz considered thus&#10;far, which implies that the beam frequency that is optimal for powering&#10;the light sail falls within the range of FRB frequencies. Thus, it seems&#10;somewhat reasonable to hypothesize that the beams can be used to power&#10;light sails, and the ensuing implications are explored next.">

<outline text="Discussion" _note="Next, we delve into some of the other consequences arising from our&#10;prior analysis.">
  <outline text="The angular velocity of the beam" _note="Hitherto, we have not discussed any of the temporal aspects of the beam.&#10;We begin by noting that FRBs are detected as pulses with a duration that&#10;is typically milliseconds. Suppose that the beam sweeps across the sky&#10;with an angular velocity that is related to via Alternatively, we can&#10;introduce the time period , which can be determined from the above&#10;formula, and is given by Thus, the beam has a characteristic angular&#10;velocity of rad/s, viz. a time period around one week.&#10;&#10;The derived sweep time of the beam direction reflects the spin or&#10;orbital motion of the beamer footprint relative to the receding sail&#10;(which cause the direction of the beam to change relative to the&#10;observer). Sweeping is likely to be operational during the relatively&#10;short acceleration and deceleration stages.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="On the dimensions of the potential light sail" _note="The total beam power required for driving a sail of total mass and&#10;maximum acceleration can be easily computed, assuming that the&#10;reflectivity is perfect . and the same characteristic value of from&#10;(\[Frequency\]) has been utilized. Note that has been normalized by that&#10;particular amount to ensure that equation (\[SailPow\]) matches the&#10;other estimates, namely equations (\[Power\]), (\[SolPow\]) and&#10;(\[HeatPow\]).&#10;&#10;This implies that the mass of the sail is approximately tons. In&#10;deriving this estimate, we have assumed a rough equipartition of the&#10;total mass between the sail and the payload, implying that the latter is&#10;also tons. If the payload’s density is akin to that of the International&#10;Space Station, the dimensions must be of order meters.&#10;&#10;The mass is rather high by human standards; most estimates for light&#10;sail propulsion are two orders of magnitude lower . This estimate is&#10;approximately equal to the early fission-based rockets considered in the&#10;literature, which posited a total weight of up to tons . Thus, if the&#10;beam was indeed used to power a spaceship, the latter would possibly&#10;have to be very large - an “interstellar ark” or “world ship” of sorts,&#10;although their typical masses ( tons) are much higher .">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Implications for the number of advanced civilizations" _note="Equation (\[distFRB\]) and the DMs listed in the FRB catalog imply that&#10;the characteristic distance to FRBs is of order a few comoving Gpc and&#10;the survey volume is of order . Since we know that there are habitable&#10;Earth-size planets in our Galaxy , and in the entire Hubble volume , it&#10;is fair to assume that there are habitable Earth-size planets within a&#10;volume Gpc. Of these, suppose that a fraction of these planets are&#10;broadcasting beams, manifested as FRBs.&#10;&#10;Next, note that the characteristic beam solid angle is steradians, based&#10;on the characteristic parameters from the previous sections and Equation&#10;(\[AnguSize\]). Since the sky is comprised of steradians, and there are&#10;broadcasting planets, at any given point in time beams are visible. Each&#10;beam is visible for ms, which implies that approximately beams should be&#10;visible in a day. The latest estimates suggest that there are FRBs per&#10;day . If we posit that not EVERY FRB arises from extragalactic&#10;civilizations, then we find,&#10;&#10;Since we know, by definition, that , we arrive at the conclusion that .&#10;If each civilization broadcasts only a single beam, this allows us to&#10;place a bound on the number of technologically sophisticated&#10;civilizations. Using this value of in conjunction with the fact that&#10;there are habitable Earth-size planets in our Galaxy leads us to the&#10;conclusion that there are less than FRB-producing civilizations in a&#10;galaxy similar to our own. These civilizations must belong to the&#10;Kardashev I class at the minimum,[^1] as seen from the characteristic&#10;power required in equation (\[Power\]). Although this number is&#10;undoubtedly on the higher side, it is consistent with the earlier, more&#10;optimistic studies involving the famous Drake equation ; some of the&#10;current theories have also yielded similar values .&#10;&#10;We reiterate that the above value is an UPPER BOUND. There exist at&#10;least three factors which can lower it:&#10;&#10;It is possible that the beam angle is not diffraction limited. Even a&#10;fairly modest choice of can lower the value of by an order of magnitude,&#10;as evident from (\[IntLifeFrac\]).&#10;&#10;Not all FRBs have an artificial origin - only a fraction of them could&#10;correspond to alien activity. As an example, one may need to single out&#10;only those FRBs that repeat, such as FRB 121102 .&#10;&#10;A civilization can set up more than one beam emitter. Although it may&#10;seem unlikely, this could very well happen if a civilization has&#10;progressed to the Kardashev II or III stages.&#10;&#10;An interesting corollary also follows: since we have assumed that FRBs&#10;are of planetary origin, the rate of FRBs is therefore set by the number&#10;of planets with advanced civilizations. This is in contrast to other&#10;models of FRBs, such as gamma-ray bursts , whose occurrence rate is&#10;determined by the formation rate of massive stars.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Recently, extensive studies have been undertaken which place&#10;    stringent constraints on the number of Kardashev III civilizations .">

  <outline text="Detecting FRBs of an artificial origin" _note="The power ‘leakage’ from the light sails would be high, comparable to&#10;the beam power, because of broadband emission since the diffraction&#10;limit is different for each frequency, unlike the idealized case of&#10;monochromatic emission studied in .&#10;&#10;It should be possible to distinguish between FRBs of natural and&#10;artificial (light sail) origin based on the expected shape of the pulse,&#10;as the beam sweeps by to power the light sail . More specifically, the&#10;sail would cast a moving shadow on the observed beam, thereby leading to&#10;a diffraction pattern and multiple peaks in the light curve based on the&#10;sail geometry . A series of short symmetric bursts would be observed as&#10;the beam’s path intersects with the observer’s line of sight . Hence,&#10;looking for similar signatures in the signal could help determine&#10;whether FRBs are powered by extragalactic civilizations (although the&#10;use of a broad range of frequencies might smear these signals).&#10;&#10;We suggest that initiatives such as Breakthrough Listen[^1] could be&#10;first directed towards the repeating FRB 121102 . This proposition is&#10;reasonable since astrophysical explosions tend to produce single bursts,&#10;while artificial beacons can repeat.&#10;&#10;[^1]: &lt;https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/1&gt;">

  <outline text="Looking beyond FRBs" _note="In our analysis thus far, we have explicitly worked with parameters that&#10;were characteristic of FRBs, such as Jy. If all other quantities were&#10;held fixed in equation (\[SpecFluxDens\]) except for the power which is&#10;lowered significantly, would be much smaller.&#10;&#10;If the beam is assumed to power a light sail, equation (\[SailPow\])&#10;implies that the light sail’s mass or its maximum acceleration should be&#10;reduced to lower the power. In turn, this implies that the spacecraft&#10;would not be capable of interstellar travel on short timescales;&#10;instead, it would be more likely to operate over INTERPLANETARY&#10;distances. Hence, there may be a large number of interplanetary&#10;spacecrafts operating at extragalactic distances that are too faint to&#10;be detected. In contrast, such spacecrafts (and beams) WITHIN our Galaxy&#10;are potentially detectable .&#10;&#10;Finally, we end our discussion with an interesting observation. There&#10;are approximately galaxies within Gpc, and approximately FRBs per day,&#10;as discussed in Section \[SSecFermiP\]. Thus, each Galaxy has a&#10;probability of FRBs/day. Hence, an FRB emanating from our own Galaxy can&#10;be detected every . A Galactic FRB at a distance of - kpc would be truly&#10;spectacular since the expected value of would be - Jy, and are&#10;detectable by low-cost radio receivers . This striking event could&#10;reveal everything that can be known about the true origin of FRBs, and&#10;thereby settle this FRB origin debate once and for all.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="In this Letter, we have posited that Fast Radio Bursts are beams set up&#10;by extragalactic civilizations to potentially power light sails.&#10;&#10;In Section \[SecConstraints\], we showed that the FRB parameters were&#10;consistent with the assumption that they are artificial beams. We also&#10;demonstrated that there existed a ‘natural’ size for the emitter which&#10;was approximately twice the diameter of the Earth. This value was&#10;obtained by adopting two contrasting estimates - the first from energy&#10;considerations, whilst the second followed from engineering constraints.&#10;Subsequently, we illustrated that the frequency needed to power the&#10;light sail was consistent with those observed for FRBs, lending further&#10;credence to our hypothesis.&#10;&#10;Our analysis gave rise to many interesting consequences. It was shown&#10;that the payload of the light sail and the beam’s characteristic period&#10;should be approximately tons and days respectively. Moreover, under&#10;certain simplifying assumptions, we derived an upper bound on the total&#10;number of intelligent civilizations in a galaxy (akin to the Milky Way).&#10;We also suggested that smaller light sails may be widely prevalent,&#10;which are presently undetectable as their spectral flux densities are&#10;too low. Using the all sky cosmological rate of FRBs, we argued that an&#10;FRB might originate within the Milky Way once every several centuries.&#10;&#10;Although the possibility that FRBs are produced by extragalactic&#10;civilizations is more speculative than an astrophysical origin,&#10;quantifying the requirements necessary for an artificial origin serves,&#10;at the very least, the important purpose of enabling astronomers to rule&#10;it out with future data.&#10;&#10;We thank James Benford, James Guillochon, Jonathan Katz, Zac Manchester,&#10;Dani Maoz, Andrew Siemion, Jason Wright and the referees for helpful&#10;comments.
