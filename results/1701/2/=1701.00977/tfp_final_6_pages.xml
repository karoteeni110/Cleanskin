    <title>STARIMA-based Traffic Prediction with Time-varying Lags</title>
    <abstract>Based on the observation that the correlation between observed traffic
at two measurement points or traffic stations may be time-varying,
attributable to the time-varying speed which subsequently causes
variations in the time required to travel between the two points, in
this paper, we develop a modified Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average (STARIMA) model with time-varying lags for short-term
traffic flow prediction. Particularly, the temporal lags in the modified
STARIMA change with the time-varying speed at different time of the day
or equivalently change with the (time-varying) time required to travel
between two measurement points. Firstly, a technique is developed to
evaluate the temporal lag in the STARIMA model, where the temporal lag
is formulated as a function of the spatial lag (spatial distance) and
the average speed. Secondly, an unsupervised classification algorithm
based on ISODATA algorithm is designed to classify different time
periods of the day according to the variation of the speed. The
classification helps to determine the appropriate time lag to use in the
STARIMA model. Finally, a STARIMA-based model with time-varying lags is
developed for short-term traffic prediction. Experimental results using
real traffic data show that the developed STARIMA-based model with
time-varying lags has superior accuracy compared with its counterpart
developed using the traditional cross-correlation function and without
employing time-varying lags. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction[sec:introduction]" _note="Road traffic prediction plays an important role in intelligent transport&#10;systems by providing the required real-time information for traffic&#10;management and congestion control, as well as the long-term traffic&#10;trend for transport infrastructure planning . Road traffic predictions&#10;can be broadly classified into short-term traffic predictions and&#10;long-term traffic forecasts. Short-term prediction is essential for the&#10;development of efficient traffic management and control systems, while&#10;long-term prediction is mainly useful for road design and transport&#10;infrastructure planning.&#10;&#10;There are two major categories of techniques for road traffic&#10;prediction: those based on non-parametric models and those based on&#10;parametric models. Non-parametric model based techniques, such as&#10;k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) ,&#10;are inherently robust and valid under very weak assumptions , while&#10;parametric model based techniques, such as auto-regressive integrated&#10;moving average (ARIMA) model and its variants , allows to integrate&#10;knowledge of the underlying traffic process in the form of traffic&#10;models that can then be used for traffic prediction. Both categories of&#10;techniques have been widely used and in this paper, we consider&#10;parametric model based techniques, particularly STARIMA (Space-Time&#10;Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)-based techniques.&#10;&#10;As for the estimation of parameters and coefficients in STARIMA model,&#10;overfitting easily occurs which makes the predictive performance poor as&#10;it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data . Furthermore,&#10;the same model and hence the same correlation structure is used for&#10;traffic prediction at different time of the day, which is&#10;counter-intuitive and may not be accurate. To elaborate, consider an&#10;artificial example of two traffic stations and on a highway, where&#10;traffic station is at the down stream direction of . Intuitively, the&#10;correlation between the traffic observed at and the traffic observed at&#10;will peak at a time lag corresponding to the time required to travel&#10;from to because at that time lag, the (approximately) same set of&#10;vehicles that have passed now have reached . Obviously, the time&#10;required to travel from to depends on the traffic speed, which varies&#10;with the time of the day, e.g. peak hours and off-peak hours.&#10;Accordingly, the time lag corresponding to the peak correlation between&#10;the traffic at and the traffic at should also vary with time of the day&#10;and, to be more specific, should approximately equal to the distance&#10;between and divided by the mean speed of vehicles between and .&#10;Therefore, in designing the STARIMA model for traffic prediction, the&#10;aforementioned time-varying lags should be taken into account for&#10;accurate traffic prediction.&#10;&#10;To validate the aforementioned intuition, we analyze the&#10;cross-correlation function (CCF) of traffic flow data at two traffic&#10;stations (stations 6 and 3), denoted as , from I-80 highway (more&#10;details of data are discussed in Section \[sub:data\_collection\]) with&#10;the formulation :&#10;&#10;where and are the traffic flow data collected in time slots from the two&#10;traffic stations, is the temporal order in the range of , and are&#10;respectively the standard deviation of and . A higher value of CCF&#10;indicates a stronger correlation of the traffic at both stations. As&#10;shown in Fig.\[fig:flow\_3\_6\], the correlation between traffic at&#10;stations 6 and 3 peaks at different time lags depending on the time of&#10;the day. During on-peak period (approximately from 6:30am - 8:30am), the&#10;correlation peaks at a time lag of (one time lag corresponds to ) while&#10;during off-peak period (approximately from 19pm - 24pm), the correlation&#10;peaks at a time lag of , where one time lag corresponds to a time of 30.&#10;We observe that at peak hours, the time lag corresponding to the maximum&#10;correlation is larger than that for off-peak hours. In the latter&#10;section, we will further show that this time lag approximately equals to&#10;the distance between the two traffic stations divided by the average&#10;speed. Therefore, our intuition explained in the previous paragraph is&#10;valid.&#10;&#10;The above observation motivates us to design a STARIMA-based traffic&#10;prediction with time-varying lags which better matches the time-varying&#10;correlation structure between traffic of different stations and hence&#10;can potentially deliver more accurate traffic prediction. More&#10;specifically, the contributions of the paper are:&#10;&#10;We analyze the CCF between the speed and traffic flow data between&#10;different detector stations and establish the relationship between the&#10;changes in the temporal lag (corresponding to the aforementioned maximum&#10;correlation) and the speed variations.&#10;&#10;An unsupervised classification algorithm based on ISODATA algorithm is&#10;designed to classify different time periods of the day according to the&#10;variation of the speed. The classification helps to determine the&#10;appropriate time lag to use in the STARIMA model.&#10;&#10;A STARIMA-based model with time-varying lags is developed for short-term&#10;traffic prediction. Experimental results using real traffic data show&#10;that the developed STARIMA-based model with time-varying lags has&#10;superior accuracy compared with its counterpart developed using the&#10;traditional cross-correlation function and without employing&#10;time-varying lags.&#10;&#10;The the rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section&#10;\[sec:related\_work\], we briefly discuss related work. Section&#10;\[sec:data\_method\] introduces the STARIMA model and the ISODATA&#10;algorithm In Section \[sec:starima\_time\_lag\_variation\], we present&#10;the details the proposed algorithm. The experimental results are&#10;presented in Section \[sec:results\]. Finally, Section&#10;\[sec:conclusion\] concludes the paper.">

<outline text="Related Work[sec:related_work]" _note="There is previous work, which predicts traffic flow using a modified&#10;ARIMA models . In and , a multivariate ARIMA based model, ARIMAX, was&#10;applied for better traffic flow prediction. The difference is that the&#10;former paper considered the varibility of the speed from upstream to&#10;downstream, the other one considered different model specifications&#10;during different time periods of the day. Similarly, the authors in also&#10;different configurations of temporal lags in ARIMA model. More&#10;concretely, they firstly applied a hidden Markov model (HMM) model along&#10;with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to evaluate the traffic&#10;state (one of {Major Accident, Minor Incident, Instability, Normal&#10;Driving}) in next time slot. After that, the ARIMA models with different&#10;configurations of temporal lags were used to predict the state of the&#10;traffic flow. All these models have improved the accuracy of the&#10;forecasting results compared with ARIMA model. However, the spatial&#10;information was less considered in these models. In this way, the&#10;STARIMA based models have aroused more and more concern.&#10;&#10;In , the authors proposed a dynamic STARIMA model by combining the&#10;dynamic turn ratio prediction (DTRP) model and the STARIMA model. In&#10;this paper, a dynamic space weigh matrix is used to capture different&#10;impact of traffic at upstream locations on traffic at downstream&#10;locations. Similarly, the research in also applied the STARIMA model&#10;with the consideration of the dynamic space weight matrix. Our work&#10;distinguish from theirs in that in our work, the space weight matrices&#10;vary with on-peak and off-peak periods to capture the time-varying&#10;correlations of road traffic at different locations.&#10;&#10;From the above related work, we can find that the &quot;\`‘dynamic’’ of a&#10;ARIMA or STARIMA model in existing research is often used to indicate&#10;the dynamic of the space weight matrix, the traffic state during&#10;different time periods . However, sometimes it is not enough to only&#10;consider these aspects. For example, Fig.\[fig:speed\_flow\_data\]&#10;presents the normalized average speed and normalized flow data collected&#10;at traffic station 6 every 30 minutes in one day. Theoretically, the&#10;weight matrix in time slot 3 (or 4, the left hollow rectangle) and slot&#10;15 (the right hollow rectangle) should be different since they are&#10;respectively in the off-peak period and peak period. However, their&#10;average speed are the same. This is caused by an inaccurate evaluation&#10;of the time range of peak or off-peak period. Furthermore, few research&#10;considered the relationship between speed and the parameters (temporal&#10;or spatial lag) in STARIMA model. Specially, a great majority of&#10;research use PACF to evaluate temporal lag which easily causes&#10;overfitting problem. Motivated by the above observations, in this paper&#10;we investigate a more efficient method to evaluate these parameters in&#10;STARIMA model with the consideration of spatial information and the&#10;variation of average speed during different time periods.">

<outline text="Data Collection [sec:data_method]" _note="\[sub:data\_collection\]&#10;&#10;In urban environment, the road structure is often complex. Also, the&#10;sensors (such as loop detectors or cameras) are not deployed at every&#10;road. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain comprehensive data. For&#10;simplicity, we only consider highway in this paper where there are only&#10;on-ramp/off-ramps so the traffic condition is comparatively simpler than&#10;that in the urban area. We use data collected from a segment of&#10;Interstate 80 (I-80) freeway located in Emeryville, California .&#10;Available data are collected every 30 seconds from six traffic stations&#10;numbered by 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 within 10 days. There are two traffic&#10;stations for upstream and downstream traffic respectively. The road&#10;topology is shown in Fig.\[fig:real\_scenario\_and\_topology\]. Note&#10;that there is no data at station 2 and there are too many interference&#10;caused by on or off-ramps at station 1 and 7. For simplicity, we only&#10;use the data collected at stations 3, 4, 5, and 6. The travel direction&#10;is from station 3 to 6.">

<outline text="STARIMA Model with Dynamic Temporal Lag[sec:starima_time_lag_variation]" _note="In this section, we first present a simple way to evaluate the temporal&#10;lag in relation to speed variation. Then we propose a classification&#10;algorithm based on ISODATA by which we can respectively obtain a set of&#10;speed clusters and a set of time period clusters. Finally, we describe a&#10;modified STARIMA model with the varying temporal lag.">
  <outline text="Temporal Lag with Variation of Speed[sub:temporal_lag_variation_speed]" _note="From Fig.\[fig:CCF\_3\_6\_different\_time\_period\], the temporal lags&#10;with maximal CCF between stations 6 and 3 are different during peak and&#10;off-peak periods. This is attributable to the variation of speed.&#10;Assuming the distance between two detector stations and is , and the&#10;vehicles keep a stable average speed , then approximately is needed for&#10;vehicles to travel from to . In other words, the traffic flow collected&#10;at station is strongly correlated with that at time ago. Thus the&#10;temporal lag with the maximum correlation should be where is the length&#10;of one temporal lag. Note that depend on the spatial order in the&#10;STARIMA model and can often be measured by loop detectors . Furthermore,&#10;the advance in telecommunication and electronic technology also brings a&#10;number of new techniques that allows us to estimate the travel time,&#10;e.g. via smartphones. Indeed, the observation discussed in the&#10;Introduction section suggests another novel way to estimate travel time:&#10;we can infer travel time from the correlation of the observed traffic.&#10;&#10;In order to validate the above discussion, we further analyze the&#10;results in Fig.\[fig:CCF\_3\_6\_different\_time\_period\] by using the f&#10;average speed information at stations 3 and 6, which is collected in the&#10;same day as the traffic flow data used in&#10;Fig.\[fig:CCF\_3\_6\_different\_time\_period\]. Specifically, the&#10;average speed from station 3 to station 6 between 6:30 am and 8:30 am is&#10;44.45 feet/second. The average speed is 67.05 feet/second between 19 pm&#10;and 24 pm. The maximal temporal lag during these two time periods is&#10;respectively 3 and 2 with 30 seconds in each temporal lag. As , given&#10;and during two time periods along with the corresponding best temporal&#10;lag and , we are able to obtain the following equation according to the&#10;theoretical analysis above:&#10;&#10;Substituting the data into formulation , it is easy to find . This&#10;result agrees with our theoretical analysis and verifies our speculation&#10;that temporal is a function of the variation of average speed in Section&#10;\[sec:introduction\].">

  <outline text="The Classification of Speed Data[sub:classification_speed]" _note="An easy way to classify speed data is by dividing into peak time and&#10;off-peak periods. After that, the temporal lag can be calculated using ,&#10;where is the average speed in time period {peak, Off-peak}. However an&#10;empirical classification is often prone to error and inaccuracy. Recall&#10;the analysis in Section \[sec:related\_work\], the evaluation of the&#10;average speed is sensitive to the time range selected for peak or&#10;off-peak period. It is obvious that the speed is not always fast even&#10;during off-peak period from Fig. \[fig:speed\_flow\_data\]. Therefore,&#10;in this paper an ISODATA[^1] based speed data classification algorithm&#10;is developed to deliver an accurate classification. Using this&#10;algorithm, we firstly classify the speed data collected in each time&#10;slot into different clusters.

In order to eliminate noise in the data, we&#10;make a &quot;\`‘smooth’’ operation by calculating the mean traffic flow every&#10;data points and regarding it as one data point.

Especially, the MAPE of station 4, 5 and 6 are&#10;all below 9% except (10am-15pm), which is attributable to the frequent&#10;fluctuation of traffic flow during this time range as shown Fig.&#10;\[fig:flow\_3\_6\]. As the minimal time range based on the configuration&#10;of is 120 minutes, it did not capture such frequent fluctuation.
