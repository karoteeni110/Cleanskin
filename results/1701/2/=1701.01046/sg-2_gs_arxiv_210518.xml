    <title>Gravastars with higher dimensional spacetimes</title>
    <abstract>We present a new model of gravastar in the higher dimensional
Einsteinian spacetime including Einstein’s cosmological constant .
Following Mazur and Mottola (2001, 2004) we design the star with three
specific regions, as follows: (I) Interior region, (II) Intermediate
thin spherical shell and (III) Exterior region. The pressure within the
interior region is equal to the negative matter density which provides a
repulsive force over the shell. This thin shell is formed by ultra
relativistic plasma, where the pressure is directly proportional to the
matter-energy density which does counter balance the repulsive force
from the interior whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum
assumed to be de Sitter spacetime which can be described by the
generalized Schwarzschild solution. With this specification we find out
a set of exact non-singular and stable solutions of the gravastar which
seems physically very interesting and reasonable. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In general relativity of Einstein there is an inherent feature of&#10;singularity at the end point of gravitationally collapsing system and&#10;has been remains an embarrassing situation to the astrophysical&#10;community. To overcome this odd phase of a stellar body where all the&#10;physical laws break down, Mazur and Mottola  proposed a new model&#10;considering the gravitationally vacuum star which was termed in brevity&#10;as Gravastar, that brings up a new arena in the gravitational system.&#10;They generated a new type of solution to this system of gravitational&#10;collapse by extending the idea of Bose-Einstein condensation by&#10;constructing gravastar as a cold, dark and compact object of interior de&#10;Sitter condensate phase surrounded by a thin shell of ultra relativistic&#10;matter whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum, i.e. the&#10;Schwarzschild spacetime is at the outside. The shell is very thin but of&#10;finite width in the range , where and are the interior and exterior&#10;radii of the gravastar, represents the thickness of the shell with .&#10;With this unique specification we can divide the entire system of&#10;gravastar into three specific segments based on the equation of state&#10;(EOS) as follows: (I) Interior: , with EOS , (II) Shell: ,  with EOS ,&#10;and (III) Exterior: , with EOS .&#10;&#10;The abovementioned model of gravastar has been studied by researchers&#10;which opened up a new challenges in the gravitational research to obtain&#10;a singularity free solution of the Einstein field equations. Therefore,&#10;it is supposed to be an alternative solution of black hole and has been&#10;studied by several authors in different context of astrophysical&#10;systems .&#10;&#10;The negative matter density in the interior region creates a repulsive&#10;pressure acting radially outward from the centre of the gravastar over&#10;the shell whereas the shell of positive matter density provides the&#10;necessary gravitational pull to balance this repulsive force within the&#10;interior. It is assumed that the dark energy (or the vacuum energy) is&#10;responsible for this repulsive pressure from the interior. In a general&#10;consideration, the EOS is suggesting that the repulsive pressure is an&#10;agent, responsible for accelerating phase of the present universe and is&#10;known as the -dark energy . In literature this EOS is termed as a ‘false&#10;vacuum’, ‘degenerate vacuum’, or ‘-vacuum’ . Therefore, in this context&#10;one can note that gravastar may have some connection to the dark star .&#10;&#10;The EOS for the shell represents essentially a stiff fluid model as&#10;conceived by Zel’dovich  in connection to the cold baryonic universe.&#10;The idea has been considered by several scientists for various&#10;situations in cosmology  as well as astrophysics .&#10;&#10;The so-called cosmological constant was introduced by Einstein in his&#10;field equations to obtain a static and non-expanding solutions of the&#10;universe. In his model this constant with the right sign could produce a&#10;repulsive pressure to exactly counter balance the gravitational&#10;attraction and thus could provide a statical model of the universe.&#10;&#10;After the experimental verification of expanding universe by Edwin&#10;Hubble between 1922 to 1924  and the success of FLRW cosmology made&#10;Einstein realize that the universe has been expanding with an&#10;acceleration. That is why later on Einstein discarded the cosmological&#10;constant from his field equation. However, though it is abandoned by&#10;Einstein but for the physical requirement to describe one-loop quantum&#10;vacuum fluctuations, the Casimir effect , cosmological constant had to&#10;appear once again in the theory with a form as , where and are the&#10;stress energy tensor and the metric tensor respectively and is the usual&#10;Newtonian constant.&#10;&#10;Recent observations conducted by WMAP suggests that of the total&#10;mass-energy of the universe is dark energy . It is believed that this&#10;dark energy plays an important role for the evolution of the universe&#10;and in order to describe the dark energy scientists have recall the&#10;erstwhile cosmological constant. Therefore, in the modern cosmology this&#10;cosmological constant is treated as a strong candidate for the dark&#10;energy which is responsible for the accelerating phase of the present&#10;universe.&#10;&#10;It is observed that in superstring theory spacetime is considered to be&#10;of dimensions higher than four. To be consistent with the physically&#10;acceptable models the -dimensional present spacetime fabric is assumed&#10;to be self-compactified form of manifold with multidimensions or extra&#10;spatial dimensions . Following this aspect very recently Bhar  has&#10;proposed a charged gravastar in higher dimension by admitting conformal&#10;motion and later on worked out a problem by Ghosh et al.  without&#10;admitting the conformal motion in the framework of Mazur and Mottola&#10;model. Some authors  have studied higher dimensional works admitting one&#10;parameter Group of Conformal motion. Usmani et al.  have also found&#10;solution of neutral gravastar in higher dimension without admitting the&#10;conformal motion. These works provide an alternative solution to the&#10;static black holes. The present study on gravastar basically is an&#10;extension of the work of Usmani et al.  and its generalization to the&#10;higher dimensional spacetime in presence of the cosmological constant .&#10;&#10;Therefore, the main motivation of this work is to study the effects of&#10;the cosmological constant for construction of gravastars and also to&#10;study the higher dimensional effects, if any. The present investigations&#10;are based on the plan as follows: The background of the model has been&#10;implemented through the Einstein geometry in Sec. 2, whereas the&#10;solution of interior spacetime, the thin shell and exterior spacetime of&#10;the gravastar have been discussed in Sec. 3. We have shown the matching&#10;condition in Sec. 4 and discussed the junction conditions for the&#10;different regions of the gravastar in Sec. 5. Some physical features of&#10;the model, viz. the proper length, Energy, Entropy are explored in the&#10;Sec. 6 which followed by the discussions and concluding remarks in Sec.&#10;7.">

  <outline text="Interior spacetime" _note="The interior region of the gravastar is so designed that the negative&#10;pressure which is acting radially outward from the central part of the&#10;star could balance the inward gravitational pulling from the shell of&#10;the spherical system. To fulfil this criterion, we choose the EOS for&#10;the interior region in the following form ,&#10;&#10;Using Eq. (\[eq8\]) and the above EOS (\[eq9\]), we obtain where is the&#10;constant density of the interior region.&#10;&#10;Using Eq. (\[eq10\]) in the field equation (\[eq5\]), one obtains the&#10;solution of as where is an integration constant. We observe from the&#10;fourth factor of the above expression that there involves a constraint&#10;which means we must consider . Hence the solution to be regular at , one&#10;can demand for . Thus essentially we get&#10;&#10;The variation of with respect to the radial coordinate is plotted in&#10;Fig. 1.&#10;&#10;Now by employing Eq. (\[eq9\]) in Eqs. (\[eq5\]) and (\[eq6\]), we&#10;obtain where is a constant of integration.&#10;&#10;Thus we have the following interior solutions for the metric potentials&#10;and as follows&#10;&#10;From Eq. (\[eq10\]) it is observed that the matter density remains&#10;constant over the entire interior spacetime. Thus we can calculate the&#10;active gravitational mass in higher dimensions as where is the internal&#10;radius of the gravastar. So the usual gravitational mass for a&#10;-dimensional sphere can be expressed by Eq. (\[eq15\]). This explicitly&#10;shows that the active gravitational mass is directly dependent on the&#10;following two factors - the radius as well as the matter density .">

  <outline text="Intermediate thin shell" _note="Here we assume that the thin shell contains ultra-relativistic fluid of&#10;soft quanta and obeys the following EOS&#10;&#10;By inspection we note that it is very difficult to obtain a general&#10;solution of the Einstein field equations within the shell of non-vacuum&#10;region. Therefore, we try to find an analytic solution within the thin&#10;shell limit, . To do so we set to be zero to the leading order. Under&#10;this approximation, the field Eqs. (\[eq5\]) - (\[eq7\]) along with the&#10;above EOS, can be reformatted in the following form&#10;&#10;Now using Eqs.

(\[eq8\]) and (\[eq22\]) we get the pressure and matter&#10;density within the shell of the gravastar as&#10;&#10;The variation of with respect to the radial coordinate is plotted in&#10;Fig. 2.&#10;&#10;\&#10;&#10;In the intermediate thin shell, therefore, by virtue of Eq. (\[eq23\])&#10;the energy conservation equation (\[eq8\]) takes the special explicit&#10;form in the pressure gradient as follows:">

The shell joins the&#10;interior and exterior regions at the junction interface. The metric&#10;coefficients are continuous at the shell, however we do not have any&#10;confirmation of the continuity of their derivatives.&#10;&#10;Following the condition of Darmois-Israel  now we provide the intrinsic&#10;surface stresses at the junction interface in the form where , that&#10;shows the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvatures or second&#10;fundamental forms.

(\[eq40\]).&#10;&#10;Therefore, combining Eqs. (\[eq38\]) and (\[eq40\]) we get where in the&#10;square bracket of Eqs.

(\[eq41\]) we observe that the energy within the shell is&#10;directly proportional to the thickness of the shell .&#10;&#10;The variation of with for different dimensions is shown in Fig. 3. One&#10;can note that the energy is increasing from the interior boundary to the&#10;exterior boundary. This is clearly indicating that the shell is getting&#10;harder from the interior to exterior boundary, which suggests that the&#10;exterior boundary is more dense than the interior boundary as obtained&#10;in Fig. 2. The plot also indicates that energy is decreasing as the&#10;dimension increases.">

  <outline text="Stability" _note="To check the stability of the gravastar in higher dimensions we are&#10;following the prescription suggested by Mazur and Mottola . For doing&#10;this we have maximized the entropy functional with respect to all&#10;variations of the mass function and investigate the sign of second&#10;variation of the entropy functional. As the end points of the boundary&#10;are fixed at and respectively, so the first variation of must vanish at&#10;and , i.e., by Einstein’s field equations of Eq.

Therefore, following Mazur&#10;and Mottola  we can conclude that “perturbations of the fluid in region&#10;II that are not radially symmetric decrease the entropy..., which&#10;demonstrates that the solution is stable to all small perturbations&#10;keeping the endpoints fixed”. In essence, generalization to the higher&#10;dimension does not affect the stability of the gravastar.">

  <outline text="Size" _note="To discuss the size of gravastars we follow its phenomenology and start&#10;from the interior condensate phase which obey the EOS . This is exactly&#10;that of the cosmological dark energy which is thought to be responsible&#10;for the accelerating phase of the present universe . It is argued by&#10;Mottola that the gravastar solution automatically fixes the vacuum&#10;condensate energy density () in terms of its size. This raised an&#10;interesting possibility that the observable universe itself could be the&#10;interior of a gravastar. In that case, following Mottola the observed&#10;cosmological dark energy of our universe can be calculated as where it&#10;is assumed that some of the critical energy density defined by the&#10;present value of the Hubble parameter would be identified with the&#10;condensate energy density.&#10;&#10;Let us now set the energy scale of the interior de Sitter energy density&#10;to [TEV]{}, so that from above Eq. (\[eq51\]) we have&#10;&#10;This is a huge energy which is required to get a gravastar that is&#10;comparable to the size of the observable universe. One can even find a&#10;link of this energy to the scale of inflation or GUT () as the above&#10;energy turns out to be .">

<outline text="Discussions and Conclusions" _note="In the present study of gravastars with higher dimensional manifold and&#10;in the presence of cosmological constant, we have considered several&#10;aspects of the system. To examine a new model of gravastar in comparison&#10;with the type proposed by Mazur-Mottola , we are especially searching&#10;for its generalization to: (i) the extended dimensional spacetime from&#10;the dimensions and (ii) the cosmological constant. It is worth to&#10;mention that using the consideration (i) along with the inclusion of&#10;Maxwell’s spacetime we have already obtained an interesting class of&#10;solutions . However, in the present work we have used the consideration&#10;(i) combined with the cosmological constant to explore possibility of a&#10;physically viable astrophysical system which can be considered as an&#10;alternative to -dimensional Schwarzschild–Tangherlini category black&#10;hole .&#10;&#10;In this section we are discussing some key physical features of the&#10;model (observed as well as speculated) as follows:&#10;&#10;\(i) We have obtained several physical parameters, e.g. metric&#10;potentials, proper length of the shell, energy, entropy etc. and our&#10;results match with the results of Usmani et al.  without the&#10;cosmological constant in higher dimensional spacetime. The variations of&#10;the parameters as shown in the plots (Figs. 1-5) indicate in favour of&#10;the physical acceptability and for the existence of gravastars.&#10;&#10;\(ii) We have calculated different parameters for three specific regions&#10;of the gravastar. All the features of the solutions suggest that the&#10;cosmological constant plays an important role for the construction of&#10;gravastars.&#10;&#10;\(iii) From Eqs. (10), (12), (14) and Fig. 1 we can observe that the&#10;pressure, matter density and the metric potentials are finite at the&#10;centre (i.e. ) of the gravastar. So the solutions that we have obtained&#10;are completely singularity free and also maintain regularity conditions&#10;inside the star.&#10;&#10;\(iv) The variation of the energy and the entropy is shown in Fig. 3 and&#10;Fig. 4 respectively. From these figures it can be observed that both&#10;energy and entropy are decreasing with the dimensions. This in turn&#10;indicates that the shell becomes less compact and the matter density&#10;must decrease with dimensions. Exactly the same nature of variation for&#10;the matter density within the shell has been observed in Fig. 2.&#10;&#10;\(v) From Fig. 5 we note that the proper length is decreasing with the&#10;increase in dimensions, which suggests that the shell become thinner in&#10;higher dimensions. This is again well justification of the Fig. 2, i.e.&#10;as the matter density decreases the energy as well as the entropy will&#10;also decrease.&#10;&#10;\(vi) In connection to Figs. 1 and 2 let us now look at the issue: how&#10;large the star will be as a function of the energy density and number of&#10;dimensions. For the interior region, the equation of state (Eq. (10))&#10;does not contribute anything to the size of the gravastar. However, via&#10;Eq. (13) we note from Fig. 1 that the size of the gravastar depends&#10;entirely on the increasing order of dimensions. In the case of&#10;intermediate region, the thin shell follows the expression (23) which is&#10;characterized by Fig. 2 and indicates that the density decreases with&#10;increasing mode of dimension. Hence, the total mass of the gravastar&#10;being constant the volume of the star becomes larger with decreasing&#10;density. Thus, for both the cases we observe that the size of the&#10;gravastar increases with higher order of dimensions.&#10;&#10;\(vii) In comparison with the previous work by Ghosh et al. it can be&#10;seen that the presence of cosmological constant for the construction of&#10;gravastar in higher dimensions shows almost the similar effects as&#10;observed in the presence of charge in the gravastar. This observation&#10;therefore indicates that the repulsive nature of the Colombian charge&#10;and cosmological constant have the similar role as far as gravastar is&#10;concerned.&#10;&#10;\(viii) It is observed that all the obtained results of the present model&#10;on gravastar are overall very much indicative that higher dimensional&#10;approach to construct a gravastar seems theoretically sound and&#10;solutions are physically acceptable. However, a close observation of&#10;different profiles and plots show that the higher dimensional modelling&#10;of a gravastar does not indicate any significant difference in nature of&#10;the physical parameters from that of the ordinary four dimensional&#10;spacetime with or without cosmological constant.&#10;&#10;As a final comment we would like to mention of a methodology which is&#10;instructive to prove the existence of a gravastar in comparison to black&#10;hole. The scheme has been first developed by Kubo and Sakai  for the&#10;case of spherical thin-shell model of a gravastar provided by Visser and&#10;Wiltshire  and later on have been exhibited by Das et al. . The method&#10;is involved in finding out microlensing effects for the gravastar, where&#10;the maximal luminosity could be considerably larger than the black hole&#10;with the same mass.&#10;&#10;In this context, one may raise the following issue: Could gravastar be a&#10;substantial fraction of the dark matter while evading microlensing&#10;constraints? As gravastar is an alternative to black hole and at present&#10;we do not have conclusive evidences of gravastar, so the explanation may&#10;be suitable in terms of rather black hole. The primordial black holes&#10;are considered to be one of the plausible candidates of dark matter&#10;which may be detected through the gravitational micro-lensing effect.&#10;The EROS and MACHO surveys have put a limit on the abundance of&#10;primordial black holes in the range  kg which indicate that primordial&#10;black holes within this range cannot constitute an important fraction of&#10;the dark matter . However, the micro-lensing constraints could naturally&#10;be evaded in the case of regrouping of primordial black holes in dense&#10;halos . As these surveys and information related to primordial black&#10;holes may be put as input in the case study of gravastars.">
