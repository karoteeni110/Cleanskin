<outline text="Pseudopotentials" _note="All density functional theory calculations were performed using&#10;[CASTEP]{} version , and its own “on-the-fly” ultrasoft pseudopotential&#10;for carbon. The definition string for the pseudopotential was:&#10;&#10;    2|1.4|1.4|1.3|6|10|12|20:21(qc=6)">

<outline text="Equilibrium positions" _note="The equilibrium positions of the 255 atoms in the tetrahedral symmetry&#10;structure with the experimental lattice constant are given in the file&#10;`TdSymmetry.cif`. The 4 nearest neighbours of the vacancy are the 1st,&#10;37th, 41st and 69th atoms listed.">

<outline text="Soft mode displacement patterns" _note="The displacement patterns of the two soft modes, labelled by and in the&#10;main text, are given in the files `u1Displacements.cif` and&#10;`u2Displacements.cif`. The 4 nearest neighbours of the vacancy are the&#10;1st, 37th, 41st and 69th atoms listed.">

<outline text="Born-Oppenheimer energy surface slices" _note="Figure \[fig:CrossSections\] shows two cross-sections of the BO surface&#10;in the plane spanned by the two soft modes of the tetrahedral structure.&#10;Figure \[subfig:mintomax\] shows a slice running from one of the three&#10;minima of the surface to the opposite high point passing through the&#10;origin of coordinates . Figure \[subfig:mintomin\] shows a slice that&#10;runs from one minimum to an adjacent minimum, and this line does not&#10;cross the origin of coordinates.&#10;&#10; ">
