    <title>First principles study of the dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion of the
neutral vacancy in diamond</title>
    <abstract>First-principles density functional theory methods are used to
investigate the structure, energetics, and vibrational motions of the
neutral vacancy defect in diamond. The measured optical absorption
spectrum demonstrates that the tetrahedral point group symmetry of
pristine diamond is maintained when a vacancy defect is present. This is
shown to arise from the presence of a dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion
that is stabilised by large vibrational anharmonicity. Our calculations
further demonstrate that the dynamic Jahn-Teller-distorted structure of
symmetry is lower in energy than the static Jahn-Teller distorted
tetragonal vacancy defect, in agreement with experimental observations.
The tetrahedral vacancy structure becomes more stable with respect to
the tetragonal structure by increasing temperature. The large
anharmonicity arises mainly from quartic vibrations, and is associated
with a saddle point of the Born-Oppenheimer surface and a minimum in the
free energy. This study demonstrates that the behaviour of Jahn-Teller
distortions of point defects can be calculated accurately using
anharmonic vibrational methods. Our work will open the way for
first-principles treatments of dynamic Jahn-Teller systems in condensed
matter. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Point defects in crystals introduce electron energy levels within the&#10;electronic band gap, trap charge carriers, emit and absorb light, and&#10;phonon scattering from them limits thermal and electrical&#10;conductivities. Such effects influence many of the most desirable&#10;properties of diamond, including its optical properties and high thermal&#10;conductivity, and point defects in diamond have been the subject of much&#10;previous theoretical work. Some defects such as the Si-V and N-V centres&#10;have been identified as potential “qubits” in quantum computers. Both&#10;these defects include a lattice vacancy, which is an important defect in&#10;its own right. The neutral vacancy in diamond is particularly&#10;significant because it is known to be stable over a wide range of doping&#10;levels, and plays a central role in defect diffusion. It is also&#10;important for its optical absorption and luminescence properties – it is&#10;associated with a series of lines in the absorption spectrum of diamond,&#10;including the strong and sharp GR1 line at  eV – and its applications in&#10;quantum information and precision sensing.&#10;&#10;   &#10;&#10;Carbon and silicon are isoelectronic, and their pristine lattices have&#10;tetrahedral point group symmetry, as depicted in&#10;Fig.\[subfig:TetrahedralCoord\]. Watkins modelled the neutral vacancy in&#10;silicon using a linear combination of atomic orbitals including only the&#10;four atoms surrounding the vacancy, showing that two electrons should&#10;occupy a triply-degenerate state. The energy of these electrons can be&#10;lowered by splitting this degenerate energy state via a static&#10;Jahn-Teller distortion of tetragonal symmetry. Theoretically, the&#10;presence of a Jahn-Teller distortion is revealed by the emergence in the&#10;undistorted structure of harmonic vibrational soft modes, i.e., modes&#10;with imaginary frequencies; this approach successfully predicts the&#10;distortion experimentally observed in the silicon vacancy. When applied&#10;to diamond, this approach also predicts a distortion, but in this case&#10;the experimental observations show that the neutral diamond vacancy has&#10;symmetry instead. (Vacancy structures with both symmetries are shown in&#10;Figs.\[subfig:TdSymm\] and \[subfig:D2dSymm\].) The experimental&#10;observations can be rationalized by the appearance of a [DYNAMIC]{}&#10;Jahn-Teller distortion, due to strong anharmonic vibrational motion. The&#10;dynamic Jahn-Teller effect is observed in a variety of systems,&#10;including doped manganites, fullerides, octahedral complexes of d ions,&#10;and the excited states of the N-V centre in diamond.&#10;&#10;In a dynamic Jahn-Teller system, there are two or more minima in the&#10;Born-Oppenheimer (BO) energy surface, which are separated by energy&#10;barriers. In the vacancy in diamond, there are three minima,&#10;corresponding to tetragonal distortions in each Cartesian direction. If&#10;the energy barriers between the minima are low enough, the wavefunction&#10;of the system is shared between the minima instead of localising in a&#10;single minimum, resulting in a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect. This means&#10;that the vibrational wavefunction possesses the symmetry of the&#10;undistorted structure. Structures at saddle points or maxima of the BO&#10;surface can be stabilised by anharmonic vibrations, even at zero&#10;temperature, through zero-point motion. Previous estimates, from&#10;experimental data, of the energy barriers between minima and an&#10;Einstein-like frequency for the tetragonal defect modes of the vacancy&#10;in diamond show that the vibrational energy quantum is larger than or&#10;comparable to the barrier energy, implying a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect&#10;close to  K.&#10;&#10;The dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the neutral vacancy in diamond is&#10;well-established experimentally, but from a first-principles standpoint&#10;the view is less clear. The commonly used harmonic approximation for&#10;lattice dynamics cannot account for the presence of a dynamic&#10;Jahn-Teller distortion, as this is an intrinsically anharmonic effect.&#10;First-principles calculations of the anharmonic vibrational wave&#10;function of the ground state of the neutral vacancy in diamond have not&#10;been reported previously, meaning that a proper description of the&#10;dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in this system is lacking. In this study, we&#10;determine for the first time an anharmonic wave function which&#10;accurately describes the dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion, providing a&#10;theoretical description of the experimentally observed symmetry of the&#10;neutral vacancy in diamond.&#10;&#10;We have used first-principles DFT methods to calculate the electronic&#10;and vibrational properties of the neutral vacancy. The electronic ground&#10;state is expected to be well-described within DFT, although some of its&#10;electronic excited states are not because they have many-body&#10;(multideterminant) character. Our study is confined to the electronic&#10;ground state. The vibrational calculations were carried out using a&#10;recently proposed vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) method, which&#10;neglects non-adiabatic effects but includes anharmonicity.&#10;&#10;We find that formation of the dynamic Jahn-Teller vacancy structure&#10;leads to a small reduction in the vibrational energy compared with the&#10;static Jahn-Teller structure when anharmonic effects are included. Our&#10;results show that anharmonic nuclear motion leads to a dynamic&#10;Jahn-Teller distortion of the vacancy in diamond very close to zero&#10;temperature, and we find that this remains true at least up to  K.&#10;&#10;The rest of this work is organised as follows: in Sec. \[sec:methods\]&#10;we outline the computational methods employed and give technical details&#10;of the calculations. In Sec. \[sec:results\] we present the main results&#10;of our study, detailing the effects of including harmonic and anharmonic&#10;contributions to the total energy, and to the vibrational density of&#10;states in each symmetry state. In Sec. \[sec:summary\] we give a brief&#10;summary of our results and some concluding remarks.">

  <outline text="Electronic calculations" _note="DFT calculations were performed with version 7.0.3 of the [castep]{}&#10;code and the corresponding ‘on-the-fly’ ultrasoft carbon&#10;pseudopotential. We have used the local density approximation (LDA) as&#10;parametrised by Perdew and Zunger,, which has been widely used in&#10;previous calculations involving diamond and similar materials. LDA-DFT&#10;calculations provide a lattice constant for diamond of  , compared to&#10;the experimental value of  . In our calculations, the LDA-DFT lattice&#10;constant is generally used, although some calculations were also carried&#10;out using the experimental lattice constant to investigate the effect on&#10;the dynamic stability of the tetrahedral symmetry state. Increasing the&#10;lattice constant was found to increase the stability.&#10;&#10;To ensure the existence of a locally stable tetragonal state (i.e., one&#10;that does not relax back to the tetrahedral symmetry when geometry&#10;optimised), a 256-atom (255 when the vacancy is present) supercell is&#10;used throughout this work. In previous DFT work on the neutral vacancy&#10;in silicon, it was observed that supercells of at least 256 atoms were&#10;required to obtain a stable tetragonal distortion, constructed as a&#10;supercell of a 32-atom BCC unit cell. Calculations with supercells with&#10;less than 256 atoms show that the same is true for diamond. The -atom&#10;supercells also allow us to effectively isolate the periodic defects&#10;from one another so that accurate structures for the tetrahedral and&#10;tetragonal vacancies can be obtained.&#10;&#10;The geometry was optimised such that the root mean square of the forces&#10;on all of the atoms was below  eV/. A simple 2-atom unit cell was&#10;relaxed to obtain the relaxed LDA-DFT lattice constant, and a 256-atom&#10;supercell was constructed from this. A vacancy was then created and the&#10;internal co-ordinates relaxed. The tetrahedral state was found by&#10;imposing the pristine lattice symmetry before relaxing, and the&#10;tetragonal state was found by imposing a tetragonal distortion on the&#10;four nearest neighbours of the vacancy, before relaxing with no symmetry&#10;constraints. In both vacancy structures, the nearest neighbours relaxed&#10;away from the vacancy (by   in the tetrahedral case) in order to&#10;increase their -like bonding , as observed in previous work.&#10;&#10;A plane-wave cut-off energy of  eV was used for relaxing the structures&#10;and for the harmonic vibrational calculations, with a Monkhorst-Pack&#10;-point grid, as the energy differences between the structures were very&#10;well converged for these parameters. A larger value of the cut-off&#10;energy was used for some calculations, corresponding to even stricter&#10;convergence criteria. The SCF cycle threshold for the energy was taken&#10;to be  eV per atom to ensure a very accurate charge density, and thus&#10;accurate forces.">

  <outline text="Vibrational calculations" _note="A finite displacement method was used to obtain the matrix of force&#10;constants, which was Fourier transformed to obtain the dynamical matrix.&#10;This was diagonalised to obtain the harmonic vibrational frequencies and&#10;eigenvectors. Atomic displacements of   were used. The anharmonic&#10;vibrational calculations were conducted using the VSCF method described&#10;in Ref.  and used successfully several times since.&#10;&#10;In this method, the BO energy surface is described in a basis of&#10;harmonic normal co-ordinates of amplitude . In these coordinates, the&#10;harmonic potential is separable, and each degree of freedom contributes&#10;, where is a harmonic frequency. Starting from the harmonic&#10;approximation, we improve the representation of the BO surface by using&#10;a principal axes approximation, which takes the form of a sum over&#10;many-body terms, truncated at second order: In this expression, is a&#10;vector containing the normal mode amplitudes , Cartesian indices are&#10;collective labels for the quantum numbers where is a phonon wavevector&#10;and a phonon branch, and is the value of the BO energy surface when the&#10;atomic nuclei are in configuration . Anharmonicity is already included&#10;in the terms, as they are not constrained to the harmonic form. The&#10;terms provide additional anharmonic corrections arising from the&#10;-dimensional subspaces of the BO energy surface that they span. The&#10;terms and in this expansion are found by mapping the BO energy surface&#10;as a function of the amplitude of each normal mode, using a series of&#10;DFT calculations and then fitting cubic splines to the results. In this&#10;work, 19 different amplitudes per mode are used in mapping the BO&#10;surface. Mapping the BO surface is by far the most computationally&#10;expensive part of the entire calculation – for example, mapping the&#10;terms scales as the number of modes multiplied by the number of mapping&#10;points multiplied by the cost of a DFT calculation, which scales&#10;asymptotically as for a simulation cell with atoms. The resulting&#10;anharmonic nuclear Schrödinger equation is solved using the VSCF method&#10;to give the anharmonic vibrational energy and free energy. The&#10;anharmonic vibrational wavefunction is written as a Hartree product of&#10;the normal modes, . The states are represented in terms of basis&#10;functions which are the eigenstates of one-dimensional harmonic&#10;oscillators. A total of basis functions were used for each degree of&#10;freedom.&#10;&#10;In most of this work only the terms are included in the expansion of .&#10;The number of calculations required to map the BO surface accurately as&#10;a function of two normal co-ordinates is approximately the square of the&#10;number required for one co-ordinate, making this computationally&#10;unfeasible if all pairs of modes were to be included. Our tests show&#10;that the terms are small for most modes, as the harmonic approximation&#10;works well for vibrations in diamond. The only large term corresponds to&#10;the -dimensional BO subspace spanned by two soft modes that are present&#10;in the tetrahedral structure of the diamond vacancy. This term has three&#10;equivalent minima, corresponding to a tetragonal distortion along each&#10;Cartesian direction. No matter how the orthogonal normal co-ordinates&#10;are chosen, it is not possible for the axes to pass precisely through&#10;more than one of these minima. This means that it is impossible to&#10;capture the behaviour of the system with minima using only the terms for&#10;these soft modes – the associated term must therefore be included.&#10;Furthermore, the vibrational wavefunction for this subspace of the BO&#10;surface cannot be described correctly as a product of two states&#10;labelled by the two corresponding normal modes . Separating the&#10;wavefunction in this way breaks the rotational symmetry of the problem.&#10;Instead, for this subspace, we separate the wavefunction using polar&#10;co-ordinates, and , where the are written in units of , with the&#10;imaginary harmonic soft phonon frequencies. This preserves the correct&#10;symmetry of the problem and allows an accurate wavefunction to be&#10;determined. The usual wavefunction is re-expressed as , where is written&#10;as a sum of isotropic harmonic oscillator radial basis states, and is a&#10;sum of sinusoids. A total of angular basis functions and radial basis&#10;functions are used for these calculations. As all of the other modes are&#10;almost harmonic and therefore well-described by the terms, the energy&#10;contribution from this particular subspace can simply be added to the&#10;energy of the rest of the terms of the tetrahedral defect.&#10;&#10;It would be extremely computationally expensive to map all anharmonic&#10;modes for both the tetrahedral and the tetragonal symmetry states of the&#10;vacancy, even if only the terms were included. However, we can take&#10;advantage of the small anharmonicity in pristine diamond. The fact that&#10;pristine diamond is well-described by the harmonic approximation implies&#10;that a necessary condition for modes to have significant anharmonic&#10;character is that they are strongly affected by the presence of the&#10;vacancy. We expect that these modes will generally have short&#10;wavelengths and high energies, as over longer length scales the effect&#10;of the vacancy will be averaged out. The effect of the vacancy on each&#10;mode can be calculated as the difference between the vacancy harmonic&#10;vibrational density of states (vDoS) and the pristine vDoS at the&#10;frequency of each mode, . We can then obtain an accurate value for the&#10;anharmonic correction to the energy without having to map all 762 modes&#10;by simply mapping the modes in descending order of , using the harmonic&#10;approximation for all unmapped modes, and converging the anharmonic&#10;correction with respect to the number of modes mapped. Converging the&#10;correction to within  meV requires 32 modes to be mapped for the&#10;tetrahedral state, but 350 for the tetragonal state, implying that the&#10;distortion away from tetrahedral symmetry leads to a large increase in&#10;anharmonicity.&#10;&#10;To further reduce the computational expense of the anharmonic&#10;calculations, an energy cut-off of  eV was used, with a Monkhorst-Pack&#10;-point grid, as the shape of the BO surface is well converged for these&#10;parameters. In some calculations larger values of these parameters were&#10;used, corresponding to even stricter convergence criteria. The energy&#10;differences between structures were converged to within  meV per atom,&#10;with the self-consistency energy threshold for the DFT calculations set&#10;to  eV per atom. The anharmonic correction to the energy in the pristine&#10;256-atom supercell was calculated from the anharmonic correction for a&#10;16-atom FCC supercell.">

  <outline text="Jahn-Teller effect and dynamical stability" _note="Figure \[fig:DiamondElecDoS\] shows the calculated electronic density of&#10;states (eDoS) for the pristine, tetrahedral and tetragonal vacancy&#10;structures. There is little difference between the eDoS of the pristine&#10;and vacancy states, apart from the appearance of a peak in the band gap&#10;almost exactly at the Fermi level in the vacancy structures. This state&#10;arises from the four ‘dangling bonds’ around the vacancy, as predicted&#10;by the Watkins model. The inset to Fig.\[fig:DiamondElecDoS\] shows that&#10;the peak splits into two upon introduction of the tetragonal distortion,&#10;as would be expected for a static Jahn-Teller distortion. These peaks&#10;correspond to the singlet and doublet states predicted by the Watkins&#10;model.&#10;&#10;Harmonic calculations show that the tetrahedral state is dynamically&#10;unstable, that is, it exhibits two soft modes, with frequencies and ,&#10;that correspond to tetragonal distortions. Unlike the tetrahedral&#10;symmetry state, the tetragonal configuration is dynamically stable,&#10;leading to the conclusion that, at this level of theory, a static&#10;Jahn-Teller distortion of tetragonal symmetry is favoured.&#10;&#10;Including anharmonicity in the treatment of the tetrahedral&#10;configuration provides a very different picture. Figure&#10;\[fig:QuarticAnh\] shows the BO surface mapped along one of the soft&#10;mode directions, split into symmetric and antisymmetric contributions to&#10;the anharmonic energy surface. The antisymmetric part mostly arises due&#10;to the fact that any given direction cannot pass through two minima AND&#10;the origin, meaning that both minima cannot be well mapped by a&#10;one-dimensional slice, as discussed above. However, the symmetric&#10;contribution clearly shows that quartic anharmonicity is present. Due to&#10;the impossibility of describing all three minima correctly using&#10;one-dimensional subspaces spanned by either soft mode individually, it&#10;is necessary to include the full -dimensional subspace spanned by both&#10;soft modes. Figure \[subfig:CoupledBOSurface\] shows the term of the BO&#10;surface mapped on the plane spanned by the two soft modes, and&#10;Fig.\[subfig:CoupledAnharmonicWavefn\] shows the anharmonic ground state&#10;nuclear density in this subspace. In addition to the slice shown in&#10;Fig. \[fig:QuarticAnh\], further slices through the BO surface in&#10;Fig. \[subfig:CoupledBOSurface\] can be found in the Supplemental&#10;Material. The anharmonic ground state vibrational density of the&#10;tetrahedral structure has peaks in each of the three minima of the BO&#10;surface, which lowers the overall energy of the system. The fact that&#10;the wavefunction is shared between the minima shows that, when&#10;anharmonic vibrational effects are included, the Jahn-Teller effect in&#10;this system becomes dynamic rather than static, with the system&#10;maintaining the full point symmetry of the pristine lattice.&#10;&#10;\&#10;&#10;The dynamical stability of the tetrahedral state is somewhat sensitive&#10;to the exact form of the BO surface found in the DFT calculations. If&#10;the relaxed LDA lattice constant ( ) is used when mapping the&#10;-dimensional BO surface of the pair of soft modes, the tetrahedral state&#10;is still dynamically unstable at  K, becoming stable at  K. However,&#10;using the experimental lattice constant of   reduces the size of the&#10;dynamical instability significantly, decreasing the absolute value of&#10;the already small ground state energy associated with the subspace by an&#10;order of magnitude. Using the experimental lattice constant the&#10;tetrahedral state is calculated to become dynamically stable at  K.&#10;Given the errors inherent in DFT calculations, our results are&#10;consistent with the tetrahedral state being dynamically stable down to&#10;liquid helium temperatures, as implied by experiment, and even to&#10;absolute zero.&#10;&#10;The minima in the BO surface are, in the polar co-ordinates defined&#10;above, at , , which correspond to tetragonal distortions along the , and&#10;directions, respectively. . The values of depend on the precise choice&#10;of the axes defined by the two soft modes. The displacement patterns&#10;corresponding to the modes and in this work are presented in the&#10;Supplemental Material, allowing these minima to be unambiguously&#10;identified. At these minima, the four nearest neighbours of the vacancy&#10;are displaced from their tetrahedral equilibrium positions; they are&#10;displaced by   AWAY from the vacancy along the distortion direction, but&#10;by half this distance TOWARDS the vacancy in the other two directions.&#10;The tetrahedral structure is at a maximum of the BO surface along the&#10;direction of the soft modes, but a minimum along all of the other modes,&#10;placing the tetrahedral structure at a saddle point of the BO surface.">

  <outline text="Thermodynamics" _note="\&#10;&#10;The tetragonal and pristine structures are dynamically stable at the&#10;harmonic level, and the previous section shows that the tetrahedral&#10;structure is also dynamically stable at low temperatures when&#10;anharmonicity is accounted for. Having therefore established that all&#10;three structures – tetrahedral, tetragonal and pristine – are&#10;dynamically stable at low temperature at the anharmonic level, we turn&#10;to their thermodynamics. The static lattice, vibrational, and formation&#10;energies at  K are reported in Table \[tab:EfEharEanh\] for all three&#10;structures, as at this temperature all three are dynamically stable. The&#10;harmonic energy and the anharmonic correction , per atom, are given, as&#10;well as the vacancy formation energy, which is calculated as: where and&#10;are the total energies of the system with and without the vacancy,&#10;respectively, and is the number of atoms in the pristine supercell. The&#10;values of for the two different symmetry states of the vacancy are&#10;presented in the third part of Table \[tab:EfEharEanh\], at three levels&#10;of theory – static (electronic), harmonic vibrational, and anharmonic&#10;vibrational.&#10;&#10;Because the tetrahedral state is dynamically unstable at the harmonic&#10;level (although not at the anharmonic level), due to the presence of the&#10;two soft modes, a harmonic vibrational energy cannot strictly be defined&#10;for this structure. Despite this, we have included an estimated value&#10;for the tetrahedral harmonic energy, calculated by simply cutting out&#10;the contribution of the two soft modes, to enable comparisons between&#10;the two symmetry states. The fact that this value involves the&#10;unphysical removal of two modes is noted in Table \[tab:EfEharEanh\].&#10;&#10;With this caveat in mind, we can look at the thermodynamic stability of&#10;the two symmetry states at  K. When only electronic and harmonic effects&#10;are included in the formation energy, the state with tetragonal symmetry&#10;is the most stable, although the inclusion of harmonic vibrational&#10;effects reduces the Jahn-Teller relaxation energy – the energy&#10;difference between the tetrahedral and tetragonal structures – from  eV&#10;to  eV. Upon inclusion of anharmonic effects, the tetrahedral state&#10;becomes the most stable, as observed experimentally, by  meV. The&#10;predicted final formation energy for the neutral vacancy, including&#10;anharmonic effects, is therefore  eV, which is close to the estimates&#10;from experiments of – eV. The formation energy of the unrelaxed vacancy&#10;at the static level is calculated to be  eV, implying a total relaxation&#10;energy of  eV at this level of theory. (This result is not included in&#10;Table \[tab:EfEharEanh\]).&#10;&#10;Comparing the vDoS of the vacancy structures to that of pristine diamond&#10;gives further insight into the effect of the vacancy on the vibrational&#10;properties. Figure \[subfig:HarvDoS\] shows the harmonic vDoS for all&#10;three structures at high energies, with the full vDoS as an inset, and&#10;Fig. \[subfig:AnhvDoS\] shows the difference between the harmonic and&#10;anharmonic cumulative vDoS, , for both symmetry states of the vacancy as&#10;well as the pristine lattice. The cumulative densities of states were&#10;formed by broadening the mode frequencies with Gaussians (of width  eV&#10;for the vacancy states and  eV for the pristine lattice) and&#10;cumulatively summing them. This allows us to see how the presence of&#10;anharmonicity changes the frequencies themselves. Figure&#10;\[subfig:HarvDoS\] confirms that the presence of the vacancy only has a&#10;significant effect on high energy vibrations. This justifies our&#10;approach of including only the highest energy vibrational modes in the&#10;anharmonic calculations. The atoms neighbouring the vacancy tend to have&#10;larger vibrational amplitudes than the other atoms in the very highest&#10;energy modes for both symmetry configurations, while for lower energy&#10;modes the amplitudes are comparable.&#10;&#10;Figure \[subfig:AnhvDoS\] shows that the effect of anharmonicity is much&#10;more pronounced in the tetragonal configuration than in the tetrahedral&#10;or pristine structures. In the tetrahedral and pristine structures, the&#10;changes in the vDoS are of a similar size, and are much smaller than the&#10;changes seen in the tetragonal case. This demonstrates that distortions&#10;away from the tetrahedral symmetry of the pristine lattice strongly&#10;increase the anharmonicity of the phonon modes, with the tetrahedral&#10;vacancy retaining the weak anharmonic character of pristine diamond. The&#10;optical modes at high energies are clearly more affected by the&#10;inclusion of anharmonicity than the low energy acoustic modes. In the&#10;pristine and tetrahedral structures, anharmonicity raises the frequency&#10;of some modes whilst lowering those of others, leading to both positive&#10;and negative values of . In the tetragonal configuration, however, it&#10;generally raises the frequency of the modes by a small amount, showing&#10;that the leading anharmonic term is quartic in character, as cubic&#10;anharmonicity always acts to lower the energy in one dimension.&#10;&#10;Given the above results at  K, we briefly examine the temperature&#10;dependence of the formation energies of the tetrahedral and tetragonal&#10;structures. Neglecting the effect of thermal expansion, which is very&#10;small for diamond over the range of temperatures considered, we&#10;calculate the anharmonic vibrational contribution to the free energy at&#10;a set of finite temperatures, using the excited states of the VSCF&#10;Hamiltonian to construct a partition function , from which we can&#10;calculate a free energy . For these calculations, 80 basis functions&#10;were used to obtain accurate excited states. Figure \[fig:TDependence\]&#10;shows the anharmonic formation energy of each symmetry state of the&#10;vacancy for a range of temperatures up to  K. It is clear that the&#10;tetrahedral structure remains the most stable over this temperature&#10;range – indeed, the difference in the formation energies of the two&#10;symmetry states increases from to  eV at  K. The calculated value of the&#10;vacancy formation energy at room temperature ( K) is  eV, again in&#10;reasonable agreement with experimental estimates of – eV.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="Our results show that the tetrahedral symmetry structure of the neutral&#10;vacancy in diamond is stabilised down to almost zero temperature by&#10;anharmonic vibrations. The vacancy undergoes a dynamic Jahn-Teller&#10;distortion which has the full point group symmetry of the pristine&#10;system, as observed experimentally. The anharmonic vibrational&#10;wavefunction of the tetrahedral defect has been calculated, and shown to&#10;be shared evenly among the three minima in the Born-Oppenheimer surface,&#10;which correspond to the three tetragonal distortions. We have also&#10;calculated the temperature dependence of the vacancy formation energy up&#10;to  K. Our value for the formation energy of the neutral vacancy agrees&#10;well with experimental estimates of – eV.&#10;&#10;Our results for the isolated neutral vacancy also imply that our method&#10;could be used to calculate anharmonic properties of other point defects,&#10;including those in diamond. Two examples of such defects are the Si-V or&#10;N-V centres, which are especially of interest due to their possible use&#10;as qubits in quantum computing. Studies of their vibrational properties,&#10;including anharmonicity, would lead to a fuller understanding of these&#10;important defects.">
