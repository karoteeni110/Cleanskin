<outline text="Introduction" _note="The measurements of the charge asymmetry provide a good precision test&#10;of the Standard Model (SM). In the SM, the asymmetry is produced by&#10;interferences between the Born and one-loop diagram of the ̄processes and&#10;between diagrams with initial-state and final-state radiation. In the&#10;rest frame, this asymmetry causes the top quark to be preferentially&#10;emitted in the direction of the initial quark, and causes the antitop&#10;quark to be emitted in the direction of the initial antiquark. In the&#10;collision at the LHC, valence quarks carry on average a larger fraction&#10;of the proton momentum than sea antiquarks, hence top antiquarks&#10;produced through annihilation are more central than top quarks. In&#10;dileptonic events, the charge asymmetry can be measured in two&#10;complementary ways: using the pseudorapidity of the charged leptons or&#10;using the rapidity of the top quarks. The asymmetry based on the charged&#10;leptons uses the difference of the absolute pseudorapidity values of the&#10;positively and negatively charged leptons, and . The leptonic asymmetry&#10;is defined as&#10;&#10;where and represent the number of events with positive and negative ,&#10;respectively. For the charge asymmetry the absolute values of the top&#10;and antitop quark rapidities ( and , respectively) are used. The charge&#10;asymmetry is defined as&#10;&#10;where and represent the number of events with positive and negative ,&#10;respectively.&#10;&#10;In these proceedings, the inclusive and differential measurements of the&#10;leptonic and charge asymmetry in the dilepton channel using data&#10;collected by the ATLAS detector  corresponding to an integrated&#10;luminosity of 20.3 from collisions at a center-of-mass energy  TeV are&#10;presented . The differential measurements are performed as a function of&#10;the mass (), transverse momentum () and boost () of the system. The&#10;measurements are performed in a fiducial region and in the full phase&#10;space.">

<outline text="Event Selection and Reconstruction" _note="Events are required to have exactly two leptons of opposite electric&#10;charge and at least two jets with GeV within . In all three final&#10;states, exactly two isolated leptons with opposite charge and an&#10;invariant mass GeV are required. In the same-flavor channels ( and ),&#10;the invariant mass of the two charged leptons is required to be outside&#10;of the boson mass window such that . Furthermore, it is required that&#10;missing transverse momentum is greater then GeV and at least one of the&#10;jets must be -tagged. In the channel, the scalar sum of the of the two&#10;leading jets and leptons is required to be larger than GeV.&#10;&#10;The main background contribution comes from Drell–Yan production of ,&#10;which is estimated by a combination of simulated samples and corrections&#10;derived from data. The smaller contributions from diboson and&#10;single-top-quark production are evaluated purely via simulations.&#10;Contributions arising from events including a jet or a lepton from a&#10;semileptonic hadron decay misidentified as an isolated charged lepton as&#10;well as leptons from photon conversions, are estimated using simulated&#10;samples, modified with corrections derived from data.&#10;&#10;The system is reconstructed in order to perform the inclusive and&#10;differential measurements of . The system is reconstructed using the KIN&#10;method. The KIN method assumes the mass of the top quarks (172.5 GeV)&#10;and mass (80.4 GeV), and solve the system of equations obtained from&#10;momentum convervation numerically using the Newton-Rhapson method. The&#10;reconstruction efficiency is above 90%. A comparison between&#10;observations and expectations is shown in Fig. \[fig:magnet\] after&#10;event reconstruction. A good agreement within the uncertainties is&#10;observed.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Unfolding" _note="The measurements of and are corrected in order to remove the effects&#10;introduced by the detector. This correction is performed by using the&#10;Fully Bayesian Unfolding (FBU) method . The measurements are unfolded&#10;back to a stable particle level in a fiducial region closely matching&#10;the detector acceptance, and back to parton level in the full phase&#10;space. The combined measurement of the three decay channels is performed&#10;during the unfolding procedure. The asymmetries are computed using the&#10;posterior probability density obtained as an output of the unfolding&#10;procedure. Systematic uncertainties related with detector modeling and&#10;background modeling are evaluated during the unfolding by using a&#10;marginalization procedure.">

<outline text="Results" _note="Figure \[fig:sumary\] shows the inclusive and differential measurements&#10;performed for and at parton level in the full phase space. The total&#10;uncertainty on the measurements is shown. The main source of uncertainty&#10;on the different measurements is the statistical uncertainty, followed&#10;by the signal modeling uncertainty. The measurements that involve the&#10;reconstruction of the system are also affected by a reconstruction&#10;uncertainty which is approximately half of the size of the statistical&#10;uncertainty. The uncertainties corresponding to the detector and&#10;background modeling do not contribute significantly to the total&#10;uncertainty. The results are compatible with the SM predictions . A&#10;similar behavior is observed on the uncertainties in the measurements&#10;performed in the fiducial region, however, there is a reduction in the&#10;modeling uncertainties. Figure \[fig:distribution\] shows the unfolded&#10;distribution for the and observables in the fiducial region. The&#10;distribution is in agreement with SM predictions. Figure \[fig:2d\]&#10;shows the and measurements in comparison with several models beyond the&#10;SM  in the full phase space. In these models, the values of the&#10;asymmetry are expected to be different from the SM expectations. The&#10;ellipses correspond to the and total uncertainty on the measurements.&#10;The correlation between and is about 48%. The measurements are&#10;compatible with the SM and do not exclude the two sets of BSM models&#10;considered.&#10;&#10;[99]{}&#10;&#10;ATLAS Collaboration, 2008 JINST 3 S08003.
