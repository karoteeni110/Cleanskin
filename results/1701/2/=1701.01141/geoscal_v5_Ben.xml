    <title>Parton saturation scaling function for exclusive production of vector
mesons and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering</title>
    <abstract>We provide a universal expression of cross sections for the exclusive
vector meson production and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) in
photon-proton and photon-nucleus interactions based on the geometric
scaling phenomenon. The theoretical parameterization based on the
scaling property depends only on the single variable , where the
saturation scale, , drives the energy dependence and the corresponding
nuclear effects. This phenomenological result describes all available
data from DESY-HERA for production and DVCS measurements. A discussion
is also carried out on the size of nuclear shadowing corrections on
photon-nucleus interaction. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction [sec:intro]" _note="A striking property of the nonlinear perturbative QCD approaches for&#10;high energy deep inelastic electron-proton (or electron-nucleus)&#10;scattering (DIS) is the geometric scaling phenomenon. In the parton&#10;saturation based framework, the total and cross sections are not a&#10;function of the two independent variables (Bjorken scale) and (photon&#10;virtuality), but is rather a function of a single scaling variable, .&#10;Such a scaling is exact asymptotic solution of a general class of&#10;nonlinear evolution equations and it is a universal property of them. In&#10;particular, it corresponds to the traveling wave solutions of those&#10;equations. The saturation scale , is connected with gluon saturation&#10;effects. At very small , the strong rise of the gluon distribution&#10;function is expected to be controlled by saturation. It was demonstrated&#10;, however, that geometric scaling is not confined to the low momenta&#10;kinematic region, it is in fact preserved by the QCD evolution up to&#10;relative large virtualities. For proton target, it extends up to ,&#10;provided one stays in small- region. For nuclear targets, that kinematic&#10;window is further enlarged due to the nuclear enhancement of the&#10;saturation scale, . It was proven for the first time in Ref. that the&#10;DESY-HERA collider data on the proton structure function present a&#10;scaling pattern at and . Similar behavior was further observed on&#10;electron-nuclei processes and on inclusive charm production . In Ref. it&#10;was demonstrated that the data on diffractive DIS, , and other&#10;diffractive observables present geometric scaling on the variable , in&#10;region , where . Moreover, the total cross sections for , and are shown&#10;to present scaling on variable . Nevertheless, provides no theoretical&#10;or phenomenological expression for the scaling function.&#10;&#10;Concerning lepton-nucleus interactions, in Ref. the nuclear dependence&#10;of the cross section was absorbed in the -dependence of the saturation&#10;scale via geometric scaling property. Namely, the cross section is&#10;obtained from the corresponding cross section for process in the form&#10;where is the saturation scale for a proton target. The nuclear&#10;saturation scale was assumed to rise with the quotient of the transverse&#10;parton densities to the power . The nucleon saturation momentum is set&#10;to be , where , and , with , as taken from the usual Golec&#10;Biernat-Wüsthoff model . The nuclear radius is given by fm. The&#10;following scaling curve for the photoabsortion cross section was&#10;considered : where , is the Euler constant and the incomplete Gamma&#10;function. The parameters for the proton case were obtained from a fit to&#10;the small- DESY-HERA data, producing , and the overall normalization was&#10;fixed by . The parameters for the nuclear saturation scale were&#10;determined by fitting the available lepton-hadron data using the&#10;relation in Eq. (\[nuclear\_scaling\]) and the same scaling function,&#10;Eq. (\[sigtot\_param\_tau\]). They obtained and .&#10;&#10;In this work, we extend the approach presented in Ref. to exclusive&#10;(diffractive) processes to describe also the observed scaling features&#10;demonstrated in Ref. . Based on the eikonal model in impact parameter&#10;space, we provide an expression for the cross section for exclusive&#10;production of vector mesons and DVCS as well. This expression provides a&#10;reasonable description for the available data for and real photons. The&#10;results are improved by allowing a global fit using the universal&#10;scaling expression which depends on very few parameters. These&#10;theoretical and phenomenological results have direct consequences on&#10;prediction for the future electron-ion colliders and also for vector&#10;meson photo-production measured in ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus&#10;collisions at the LHC . In the next section, we present the theoretical&#10;framework employed in the construction of the scaling function and&#10;analyse the data description discussing the possible limitations of&#10;approach and possible improvements. Finally, in the last section, we&#10;present our main conclusions.">

<outline text="Cross sections for exclusive vector meson production and DVCS [sec:sigma]" _note="The starting point in the derivation of our scaling formula for the&#10;exclusive cross section for the process, (with and ), is the eikonal&#10;model in the impact parameter space . The elastic scattering amplitude&#10;in general is assumed to be purely imaginary and the -channel unitarity&#10;implies that . In the eikonal approach, , where the eikonal is a real&#10;function. Thus, gives the probability that no inelastic interaction&#10;takes place at impact parameter . Assuming for simplicity a Gaussian&#10;form for the eikonal, , analytical expressions for total and elastic&#10;cross sections are generated,&#10;&#10;Therefore, by use of the eikonal function in factorized form (with )&#10;discussed above one obtains,&#10;&#10;In hadronic models, the quantity depends on energy (in general,&#10;logarithmic behavior on energy). For the purpose presented here, the&#10;cross sections are being computed for fixed energy and thus we consider&#10;to be energy-independent. The Gaussian function is chosen as it allows&#10;the -integration to be analitically computed. Moreover, the&#10;two-dimensional Fourier transform of Gaussian profile has the&#10;exponential form, (with ), which is supported by the data on exclusive&#10;production in DIS. More sofisticated models can be used, as the one&#10;corresponding to the power - like (dipole) form factor in momentum&#10;transfer representation , (with ). It is clearly evident that the&#10;proposal of a scaling inclusive cross section having the form in Eq.&#10;(\[sigtot\_param\_tau\]) relies on the total cross section from the&#10;eikonal model, Eq. (\[sigtot\]), with the following identification, and&#10;. The and parameters absorb the lost information when using a&#10;oversimplified photon wave-function overlap within the color dipole&#10;framework. Therefore, we will construct the scaling function for&#10;describing exclusive diffractive processes starting from Eq.&#10;(\[sigel\]). The main point is to associate the exclusive vector meson&#10;production and DVCS process as a quasi-elastic scattering.&#10;&#10;Before we proceed to the exclusive case, we would like to discuss in&#10;further detail the derivation of Eq. (\[sigtot\_param\_tau\]) using the&#10;eikonal model. The starting point is to define the elementary&#10;dipole-target (proton) scattering amplitude, excluding multiple&#10;scattering of the color dipole. Using color transparency and geometric&#10;scaling property one has, in general, for a fixed dipole size , , where&#10;effective is the anomalous dimension. Now, we construct the elastic&#10;amplitude in -space using the eikonal formalism (which includes the&#10;multiple dipole-target scattering) and averaging over dipole sizes, with&#10;, where and we can write (with ). Using the recent determination of&#10;effective anomalous dimension and the typical values for from&#10;phenomenology , we can estimate the parameters and . They are quite&#10;close to the values , found in Ref. .&#10;&#10;For vector meson production, we have to include information related to&#10;the meson wave-function and in the DVCS case information on the real&#10;photon appearing in the final state. Adding this new information will&#10;modify the overall normalization in Eq. (\[sigel\]) and possibly also&#10;the parameter and considered in Ref. . In order to clarify the&#10;situation, we shortly review the exclusive production within the color&#10;dipole framework.&#10;&#10;In an exclusive production process (vector mesons or DVCS) the photon&#10;splits into a dipole of transverse size and longitudinal momentum&#10;fraction which scatters elastically off the target (proton or nucleus),&#10;with virtuality and recombines into a vector meson of mass or real&#10;photon of zero virtuality, . Specifically for the former process, one&#10;introduces the wave-functions which describe the splitting of the vector&#10;meson with polarization into the dipole. An important ingredient to&#10;compute the production amplitude is the corresponding overlap function.&#10;These functions for the vector meson case and for DVCS are where the&#10;wavefunctions describe the splitting of a virtual photon with&#10;polarization into a dipole. The indices and denote the helicities of the&#10;quark and the anti-quark composing the dipole of flavor . Vector meson&#10;wave-functions rely on phenomenological models as the boosted Gaussian&#10;(BG) and the light-cone Gaussian (LCG) .&#10;&#10;The overlap functions for exclusive processes are well known and we&#10;summarize them below. First, for the DVCS process one has, where and&#10;denote the charge and mass of the quark with flavor with . Now, for the&#10;vector meson of polarizations one obtains, where the constant is an&#10;effective charge. Those expressions are very similar to the photon ones&#10;except for the function which it is related to the vertex function and&#10;depends on the model.&#10;&#10;Accordingly, considering the scattering amplitude for the exclusive&#10;process, (), pure imaginary and disregarding real part contribution and&#10;skewness corrections as well, the differential cross-section reads where&#10;is the dipole-target scattering amplitude and carries all the energy&#10;dependence via the rapidity which is obtained from the center-of-mass&#10;energy and the typical momentum scale for the exclusive process. For&#10;instance, for vector meson production of mass one writes . Moreover, one&#10;has , where represents the transverse momentum transfered by the target&#10;during the collision.&#10;&#10;From Eqs. (\[ovvml\]) and (\[ovvmt\]), the main features about the meson&#10;properties are embedded into the function. In general, the&#10;wave-functions in the mixed representation are obtained from the&#10;momentum representation wave-functions using a Fourier transform,&#10;&#10;In the simplest case one considers that a heavy and have the same&#10;longitudinal momentum fraction and that the transverse momentum is quite&#10;small. Such an hypothesis yields . The only free parameter is the&#10;normalization, , which can be determined by fixing the partial width for&#10;to the experimentally measured value,&#10;&#10;Therefore, the wave-function in the mixed representation obtained via&#10;Eq. (\[fouriertrans\]) is written as where , with being the coupling of&#10;the meson to the electromagnetic current. We will use the approximation&#10;in Eq. (\[wfapprox\]) in the following discussion. The wavefunction&#10;overlap appearing in Eq. (\[eq:sigmaeldip\]) takes the simplified form,&#10;, where . That is, the exclusive production of vector mesons, , in deep&#10;inelastic scattering is a hard scattering process in which the&#10;transverse size of quark configurations that dominate the production&#10;amplitude are under theoretical control. The quantity is now process&#10;dependent (distinct for light and heavy mesons) and for a naive&#10;estimation one can use an average value . Repeting the discussion after&#10;Eq. (\[analitic\]), for exclusive production of vector mesons one has .&#10;In our analysis we allow the parameters (and ) to be process dependent.&#10;We have shown in equation Eq. (\[analitic\]) that the parameters and are&#10;correlated. Moreover, the parameter is connected to the peak (in&#10;variable) of the overlap function, which is process dependent. Indeed,&#10;it depends also in the corresponding kinematics as already presented in&#10;Ref. . In exact geometric scaling models, the parameter (the effective&#10;anomalous dimension) should be process independent. Namely, it is a&#10;constant between 0.5 (BFKL dynamics) and 1 (DGLAP dynamics). However, in&#10;extended geometric scaling models (see, for instance Ref. ) it acquires&#10;a -dependence and this can be translated in a change on value depending&#10;on (specific wavefunctions overlap) the process.&#10;&#10;The exclusive processes described above can be directly compared to the&#10;inclusive case, in which the total absorption cross section is related&#10;to the imaginary part of scattering amplitude, where the quantum&#10;mechanics average is taken over the initial and final state virtual&#10;photons,&#10;&#10;Finally, we can write down a scaling curve for exclusive processes using&#10;the eikonal model result in Eq. (\[sigel\]) and the geometric scaling&#10;assumption as derived in Eq. (\[analitic\]). The remaining ingredient it&#10;to redefine the overall normalization for the different cases. The total&#10;cross section for an exclusive process (DVCS and vector mesons) is&#10;written as follows, where in case of vector mesons and for DVCS process.&#10;In both cases, , with for exclusive production of mesons and for DVCS.&#10;Explicitly, the overall normalization of cross sections is obtained from&#10;the inspection of the overlap functions in Eqs. (\[eq:sigmaeldip\]) and&#10;(\[eq:sigmaabsdip\]). Therefore, the final expressions for the overall&#10;normalization in our scaling function are given by&#10;&#10;In next section we wiil test the assumption above and discuss the&#10;consequences for the case where nuclei targets are considered. The&#10;stability and model dependence for the parameterss ( and ) are analysed.">

<outline text="Results [sec:result]" _note="Let us now compare the scaling curve, Eq. (\[sigexcl\]), to the&#10;available experimental data in small- lepton-proton collisions. The data&#10;sets we have considered are presented in Refs. . The values of&#10;parameters , and were taken from Ref. and displayed in Tab. \[tab:par\].&#10;We perform a fit to the experimental data using MINPACK routines  for&#10;choices of sets of parameters, described in the following. Our results&#10;are presented in Table \[tab:chi\] and in the Figures \[fig:1\] and&#10;\[fig:2\] as a function of the scaling variable . Explicitly, the&#10;scaling variable is for exclusive production of mesons and for DVCS,&#10;with as discussed in the introduction section.&#10;&#10;We use two different choices to perform the fits. The first one, labeled&#10;“Fit 1&quot; in the figures and table, adjusts all the three parameters (,&#10;and ). The other one, labeled “Fit 2&quot; in the figures, fits , parameters,&#10;maintaining fixed . In general both fits describe in good agreement the&#10;available data for all observables (with the exception of meson) for&#10;photon-proton interactions. It is very clear that the quality of fit for&#10;Fit 1 and Fit 2 are somewhat equivalent. Fit 2 is a straightforward&#10;extension of the celebrated scaling curve presented in Ref. for the&#10;inclusive case. The overall normalization is common to inclusive and&#10;exclusive photon-target processes. For the sake of completeness, we also&#10;include the result using the original values for the parameters from the&#10;fitting to inclusive data (labeled by ASW in the curves) .&#10;&#10;In Fig. \[fig:1\] the cross section for DVCS and production are&#10;presented as a function of the scaling variable . Our scaling curves are&#10;represented by the solid (Fit 1) and dashed (Fit 2) lines in the figure.&#10;From Table \[tab:chi\], the quality of fit is very good even for Fit 2&#10;which considers only two parameters and . It is interesting to note the&#10;stability of parameters and in both cases and the proximity with the&#10;values obtained for the inclusive case and (deviation of %).&#10;&#10;In Fig. \[fig:2\] the scaling data for and meson are presented, using&#10;the same notation as in the previous figure. The corresponding for the&#10;case is problematic even including the recent data from DESY-HERA. The&#10;origin of such a discrepancy should be treated in a deeper study as the&#10;meson is in the transition region from light to heavy mesons. On the&#10;other hand, the quality of fit for the case is excellent where now in&#10;Fit 2. We verify also that the parameters and deviate more strongly from&#10;the original values for the inclusive case. We will discuss the&#10;consequences of these facts in the following. The main explanation on&#10;why the fit with three parameters (Fit 1) provides almost always worse&#10;than the one with two parameters (Fit 2) is the complex bahavior of the&#10;scaling curve as a function of the original seed in the fitting&#10;procedure. It probably means that the minimisation procedure went to a&#10;local minimum (clearly, Fit 2 with the parameter b gives a smaller ). A&#10;possible improvement in our analysis would be to consider a global&#10;analysis for exclusive observables. In any case, Fit 2 still gives a&#10;reasonable data description (we have tested the fit using the option&#10;where and are very larger than the original ASW parameters and obtain&#10;and with ). We clearly have a problem to describe the case, and the&#10;coherence could be improved by including also a scale dependence of the&#10;t slope. It is well known that -slope strongly depends on for and ,&#10;while flat for DVCS and . For instance, parametrizing and introducing it&#10;in to the fit could improve the coherence of parameters among the&#10;different processes. Here, the cross section (integrated on t) was&#10;obtained using the simplified gaussian behavior for the impact parameter&#10;dependence. The differential cross section was not calculated and&#10;probably would present distinct behavior when comparing DVCS, and light&#10;mesons.&#10;&#10;The main features from the scaling curve can be traced from the&#10;asymptotic limit of Eq. (\[sigexcl\]). For instance, for which&#10;corresponds to large values of scaling variable one has . On the other&#10;hand, in the limit related to the large values one has . This discussion&#10;is important in the photoproduction case, where one has the smallest&#10;values for the scaling variable . This is the case for the few available&#10;data points for , and states , mostly of them measured for and having&#10;large experimental uncertainties. For light mesons at GeV (HERA-HERA),&#10;one can use the asymptotic expression for and an approximation in the&#10;photoproduction limit would be modulo logarithmic corrections. It gives&#10;b for , which it is consistent with order of magnitude of data. For and&#10;, the variable is still large and then we can obtain the following&#10;approximation, (using ). This produces b for and b for . In any case,&#10;these crude estimations are consistent with the current experimental&#10;results .&#10;&#10;The geometric scaling present in the lepton-proton cross sections for&#10;exclusive processes, as quantified by Eq. (\[sigexcl\]), is translated&#10;to the scattering on nuclear targets at high energies. Following the&#10;same arguments given in Ref. , the atomic number dependence is absorbed&#10;in the nuclear saturation scale and on the overall normalization related&#10;to the nuclear radius. Therefore, the cross section for lepton-nuclei&#10;scattering takes the following form, where the scaling variable in&#10;nuclear case is . In particular, we expect that for large the relation&#10;is . As the current data on nuclear targets are quite scarce at small-&#10;region, the scaling formula above can be tested in future measurements&#10;in EICs or in ultraperipheral heavy ions collisions. The robustness of&#10;the geometric scaling treatment for the interaction is quite impressive&#10;and similar scaling properties have been proved theoretically and&#10;experimentaly, for instance in charged hadron production and in prompt&#10;photon production on and collisions in colliders energy regime.&#10;&#10;Still discussing the nuclear case, the fitted values for the parameter&#10;have strong consequences on the role played by the nuclear shadowing for&#10;the distinct final states we have considered here. As defined in , the&#10;relation between the nuclear saturation scale, , and the proton one, ,&#10;is given by, which implies that the small- data on nuclear structure&#10;functions favour an enhancement of the nuclear saturation scale faster&#10;than the usual estimation. Moreover, the coincidence of the and&#10;parameters in the inclusive case indicates absence of shadowing in the&#10;nuclear parton distributions at . We see that the situation is different&#10;in the exclusive case. For instance, for DVCS at high and for&#10;electroproduction of the parameter is still similar to the inclusive&#10;case. On the contrary, for the light meson the deviation is quite large,&#10;where . This indicates that a study for the value of parameter in a&#10;electron-ion collider is quite important. Probably, its value for&#10;exclusive processes in interactions should be larger than for the&#10;inclusive case allowing for a strong nuclear shadowing even for milder&#10;values of photon virtualities. In order to qualify this discussion, we&#10;compare our predictions to the cross sections, , extracted from the&#10;ultraperipheral data from RHIC and LHC. In Fig. \[fig:3\]-a is shown the&#10;photonuclear cross section for production using the parameters of Fit 2&#10;as a function of photon-nucleus energy, . The extracted cross sections&#10;are from Ref. (labeled GKSZ) and Ref. (labeled Contreras) and the data&#10;description is quite reasonable. A similar analysis could be done also&#10;for state using an extracted cross section as discussed for instance in&#10;Ref. . In Fig. \[fig:3\]-b, the prediction for production is considered&#10;also using the parameters from Fit 2. The situation here is more&#10;complicated as the extracted cross sections include the UPC data from&#10;RHIC (AuAu collisions) which correspond to low energy range. The cross&#10;section at higher energy is obtained from the LHC PbPb data. We have&#10;considered the cross sections values available in Ref. (labeled FGSZ).&#10;For simplicity, at low energy we consider a black disk scaling following&#10;Ref. , i.e. (with b and ). The low energy contribution corresponds to&#10;the dashed curve, the geometric scaling prediction is the dot-dashed&#10;curve and the total result is represented by the solid curve. The data&#10;description is still reasonable given the simplicity of the approach,&#10;with the total result underestimating the high energy extracted cross&#10;section.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Summary and conclusions [sec:sumcon]" _note="This work demonstrates that by assuming geometric scaling phenomenon in&#10;exclusive processes at small- and simple considerations on the scope of&#10;eikonal model, one is able to describe the available data on DVCS and&#10;vector meson production on nucleon target with a universal scaling&#10;function without any further parameter. We establish that the geometric&#10;scaling parametrization can be extrapolated to nuclear targets to be&#10;tested in future EICs or in ultra-peripheral collisions. This implies&#10;that such dimensionless scale absorbs their energy and atomic number&#10;dependences. The scaling curve is derived for the first time for&#10;exclusive case, generalizing the scaling curve found for the inclusive&#10;cace. The identification of the physical meaning of the corresponding&#10;parameters is done and the implications of those values in the nuclear&#10;case has been discussed.The application of the current result for the&#10;diffractive structure function and the ratio is straightforward.&#10;&#10;This work was financed by the Brazilian funding agency CNPq.
