    <title>Modeling for Stellar Feedback in Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>
    <abstract>Various heuristic approaches to model unresolved supernova (SN) feedback
in galaxy formation simulations exist to reproduce the formation of
spiral galaxies and the overall inefficient conversion of gas into
stars. Some models, however, require resolution dependent scalings. We
present a sub-resolution model representing the three major phases of
supernova blast wave evolution —free expansion, energy conserving
Sedov-Taylor, and momentum conserving snowplow— with energy scalings
adopted from high-resolution interstellar-medium simulations in both
uniform and multiphase media. We allow for the effects of significantly
enhanced SN remnant propagation in a multiphase medium with the cooling
radius scaling with the hot volume fraction, , as . We also include
winds from young massive stars and AGB stars, Strömgren sphere gas
heating by massive stars, and a gas cooling limiting mechanism driven by
radiative recombination of dense H<span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span> regions. We present initial
tests for isolated Milky-Way like systems simulated with the <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gadget</span> based code SPHgal with
improved SPH prescription. Compared to pure thermal SN input, the model
significantly suppresses star formation at early epochs, with star
formation extended both in time and space in better accord with
observations. Compared to models with pure thermal SN feedback, the age
at which half the stellar mass is assembled increases by a factor of
2.4, and the mass loading parameter and gas outflow rate from the
galactic disk increase by a factor of 2. Simulation results are
converged for a two order of magnitude variation in particle mass in the
range (1.3–130) solar masses. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Current cosmological simulations of baryonic and dark matter (DM) have&#10;made great advances in recreating the epochs and spatial distribution of&#10;galaxies . A major challenge is the reproduction of the overall&#10;inefficiency of galaxy formation with physically self-consistent models.&#10;Typically, there is a tendency for gas in simulated galaxies to&#10;transform into stars too efficiently and too early, resulting in stellar&#10;mass fractions larger than observed and stellar populations older than&#10;observed .&#10;&#10;In the case of low mass galaxies, early work has pointed at efficient&#10;feedback from supernova (SN) explosions as the appropriate solution, as&#10;it would suppress stellar formation at early epochs by heating up and&#10;diffusing gas, resulting in systems with lower stellar mass fractions&#10;and younger stellar ages . The most widely used feedback is SN-driven&#10;outflows , and such flows are detected in many observations at low and&#10;high redshifts . Considering the large variations in numerical&#10;implementations to create galactic outflows in galactic and cosmological&#10;simulations, it appears that it is not yet clear how best to implement&#10;SN feedback into simulations with limited resolution, which cannot fully&#10;resolve individual SN explosions and turbulent interstellar medium&#10;(ISM).&#10;&#10;The simplest implementation of SN feedback is to inject thermal energy&#10;locally to the surrounding medium. This energy, however, is quickly&#10;radiated away in dense regions and the blast wave evolution is followed&#10;incorrectly . This situation is an artifact of low resolution&#10;simulations, preventing previous SN explosions from vacating their&#10;surroundings, thus keeping subsequent SN explosions in dense areas .&#10;Some studies attempt to avoid this by applying a stochastic stellar&#10;feedback that is, first, calibrated to match the observed galaxy stellar&#10;mass function and, second, distributed over less mass than heating all&#10;neighbors, which results in longer cooling times .&#10;&#10;A second order approach consists of transferring part or all of SN&#10;energy as kinetic energy to the surrounding medium by conserving&#10;momentum from the initial explosion . In this scenario, however, most of&#10;the energy transferred might still end up in thermal form, since the&#10;ratio of transferred kinetic energy to total SN energy is proportional&#10;to the ratio of transferred SN ejecta mass to the mass of the&#10;surrounding medium when momentum conservation is imposed . Thus, while&#10;this approach explicitly includes the momentum of the ejecta, it&#10;effectively evolves to the usual “thermal feedback” algorithm.&#10;Therefore, overcooling still plays a part in hindering SN energy&#10;feedback from noticeably affecting the structure and evolution of&#10;simulated galaxies.&#10;&#10;To prevent overcooling from nullifying SN energy feedback, recent&#10;studies adopted approximate approaches, such as decoupling SN-affected&#10;gas from hydrodynamic interactions , implementing decoupled multi-phase&#10;ISM , suppressing radiative cooling effects on SN-heated gas for several&#10;tens of Myr , constructing feedback mechanisms based on the evolution of&#10;superbubbles , and stochastically enhancing heating of SN-affected gas .&#10;As encouraging as the results are at replicating SN-driven winds and&#10;star formation rates (SFR), the methods have limited predictive power as&#10;they are not based on AB INITIO physical modeling of the stellar&#10;feedback process.&#10;&#10;In this study we attempt to develop a numerical stellar feedback&#10;prescription based as closely as possible on standard physical&#10;principles. It includes winds and heating from young massive stars as&#10;well as feedback from SN explosions, the latter following the known&#10;physical processes that govern the different phases of SN remnants. We&#10;use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code SPHGal , an&#10;implementation that incorporates several improvements into the &lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Gadget&lt;/span&gt; code to address some&#10;known SPH problems. Our approach is most similar to the stellar feedback&#10;in and , as well as the Feedback in Realistic Environment (&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Fire&lt;/span&gt;) project, presented in and&#10;used by , , and . We apply our stellar feedback to an isolated Milky&#10;Way-like galaxy within an isolated dark halo. The tools developed here&#10;are in use by the cosmological code in .&#10;&#10;We break our approach into three parts: feedback from young, pre-SN&#10;stars, feedback from dying low-mass stars, and feedback from SN events.&#10;(1) We include the effects of stellar winds from young stars by&#10;transferring momentum to neighboring gas particles for the first few&#10;Myr. We also heat gas particles within the Strömgren sphere of young&#10;star particles, mimicking the effects of ionizing radiation from massive&#10;stars . (2) We transfer momentum from old, low-mass stars to the&#10;surrounding gas throughout several Gyr after a type II SN has occurred,&#10;to imitate the slow winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.&#10;&#10;\(3) In our SN feedback model, we transfer SN energy to the closest gas&#10;particles to the SN event, each one receiving mass and energy according&#10;to a computed high resolution evolution of SN remnants (SNR). Detailed,&#10;very high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution show that&#10;they pass through three successive phases: free expansion (FE),&#10;energy-conserving Sedov-Taylor (ST), and momentum-conserving snowplow&#10;(SP) . In our model, which we call the SP-model, each neighboring gas&#10;particle receives energy following the physics governing the SNR phase&#10;in which the gas particles lie. If the gas particle lies within the&#10;radius of the ejecta-dominated FE phase, SN energy is transferred by&#10;conserving the ejecta momentum. If the gas particle lies outside the FE&#10;radius but within the radius of the adiabatic blast wave ST phase, SN&#10;energy is transferred 30% as kinetic energy and 70% as thermal energy.&#10;Finally, if the gas particle is beyond the ST radius and into the realm&#10;of the pressure driven and momentum conserving SP phase , then part of&#10;the original SN energy is dissipated and only a fraction is transferred&#10;to the gas particle, with the thermal portion dissipating more quickly&#10;than the kinetic portion following a prescription based on the detailed,&#10;high resolution, hydrodynamic treatments of SNR evolution in . Our&#10;treatment of feedback in the SP phase allows for a multi-phase medium by&#10;allowing for the volume fraction that is hot and tenuous.&#10;&#10;The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. \[sec:sim\] we describe our&#10;numerical code simulation setup and feedback implementation, in&#10;Sec. \[sec:results\] we present our results, and in&#10;Sec. \[sec:conclusions\] we discuss these results and possible further&#10;developments.">

  <outline text="Numerical Code" _note="To test our SN feedback treatment, we used a recently modified version&#10;of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Gadget&lt;/span&gt; . The improved&#10;version —SPHGal— is described in detail by . SPHGal includes an&#10;artificial viscosity implementation modified from the version presented&#10;in that uses a shock indicator based on the time derivative of the&#10;velocity divergence so as to improve the shock treatment. It also&#10;includes an energy diffusion implementation based on to correct for&#10;mixing instabilities. Finally, it includes a switch from a&#10;density–entropy to a pressure–entropy formulation to more accurately&#10;compute contact discontinuities as described in , , and . As in the&#10;original &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Gadget&lt;/span&gt; code,&#10;SPHGal calculates the gas dynamics using the Lagrangian SPH technique&#10;and it ensures the conservation of energy and entropy .&#10;&#10;To complement the original &lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Gadget&lt;/span&gt;, in which star formation&#10;and cooling was computed for a primordial composition of hydrogen and&#10;helium , we included metal-line cooling using the method and cooling&#10;rates described in , where net cooling rates are tracked for 11 species:&#10;H, He, C, Ca, O, N, Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe. This method exposes the gas&#10;to the redshift-dependent UV/X-ray and cosmic microwave background&#10;modeled in and allows for mixing and spreading of metal abundances in&#10;the enriched gas. The code assumes the gas to begin with zero&#10;metallicity and to be optically thin and in ionization equilibrium.">

  <outline text="Radiative Recombination" _note="To account for radiative recombination processes in the cool (10 K) ISM,&#10;where H and He line cooling dominate, we implemented a simple cooling&#10;limiting mechanism based on the recombination time of dense H&lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt; regions. The recombination&#10;time for a gas particle is defined by , where is the hydrogen number&#10;density of the ISM in cm and cm s is the effective radiative&#10;recombination rate for hydrogen, assuming a sphere temperature of K .&#10;&#10;We calculate the gas temperature resulting from the cooling limiting&#10;effect at every time step using the following definition where and are&#10;the gas particle temperatures as determined by the cooling rates&#10;described in (see Sec. \[subsec:code\]) for the previous and current&#10;time steps and , respectively, and is the time step size. If the&#10;resulting recombination-limited temperature is below K, then the gas&#10;particle gets assigned instead of . The purpose of this limitation on&#10;the cooling rate is to allow for the fact that the relevant atomic&#10;processes (i.e., H and He line cooling) cannot proceed faster than the&#10;recombination time even if the code assumes (for simplicity) equilibrium&#10;states of ionization.">

  <outline text="Early Stellar Feedback" _note="As described by several stellar evolution models , almost as much&#10;momentum is emitted into the ISM by winds from young massive stars as by&#10;type II SN explosions. Furthermore, radiation from these massive stars&#10;heats and ionizes the surrounding gas. The effect of this ionizing&#10;radiation can be characterized by the Strömgren sphere surrounding&#10;massive stars, within which the ISM is ionized and heated to 10 K .&#10;&#10; presented an “early stellar feedback” model that adds thermal energy to&#10;gas surrounding stars, but only considering the energy in the UV stellar&#10;flux —approximately 10% of the total stellar luminosity . To have a more&#10;complete model for pre-SN stellar feedback, we included two distinct&#10;feedback mechanisms from young massive stars before they explode as SN:&#10;stellar winds and Strömgren sphere heating .&#10;&#10;We implemented a simple momentum conservation energy transfer of winds&#10;from massive stars, to first approximation using the same amount of&#10;ejected mass and ejecta velocity as those of type II SN explosions (see&#10;Sec. \[subsubsec:implementation\]) evenly spread in time from star birth&#10;up to the moment of SN explosion .&#10;&#10;We also included Strömgren sphere heating by adjusting the temperature&#10;of cold gas particles within the Strömgren radius of a star particle,&#10;defined as where is the ionizing photon flux and equals , with being the&#10;number of stars to explode as type II SN.

  <outline text="SN Energy Feedback">
    <outline text="SNR Phases in Detail" _note="Our motivation for developing a snowplow phase driven SN feedback is&#10;based on the current spatial and temporal resolutions of simulations,&#10;which are far from being able to resolve individual SN events and the&#10;energy transfer that occurs in their immediate vicinity in time and&#10;space . The typical duration of the first phase of a SNR —the FE phase—&#10;is limited to a time yr, beyond which the Sedov-Taylor phase begins .&#10;During time &amp;lt;  the ejected mass is much greater than the swept up&#10;mass and to lowest order it expands at nearly constant velocity,&#10;conserving momentum as it hits the surrounding medium.&#10;&#10;The radius at which the FE phase ends lies at the point where the total&#10;mass swept by the SNR blast wave equals the mass of the SNR itself. This&#10;occurs at a radius where is the mass ejected in the SN event and is the&#10;mass density of the surrounding medium. SPH simulations with particles&#10;masses 10 M numerically result in in the order of tens of parsecs.&#10;Clearly, implementing SN feedback based on pure momentum conservation of&#10;the SN ejecta, as it applies to the FE phase, would be hitting the&#10;limits of spatial resolution, which is typically larger than 100 pc.&#10;&#10;During the ST phase the blast wave expands adiabatically, experiences&#10;negligible radiative loses, and is described by a self-similar solution&#10;. The kinetic energy of the expanding material is fixed at 30% of the&#10;total energy. Radiative cooling becomes significant when the blast wave&#10;expands beyond the radius where is the kinetic energy of the ejecta&#10;normalized to 10 erg, is the number density of the surrounding&#10;(primarily) hydrogen medium[^1] in cm, as described in , and is the&#10;volume fraction of the surrounding medium that is hot and has a very low&#10;density. The dependence of on is obtained from analysis of the high&#10;resolution simulations of . That work also found that in&#10;self-consistently generated multiphase media there was a strong&#10;correlation between the volume averaged temperature and the filling&#10;factor of the hot gas, which is well approximated[^2] by where K. With&#10;this formulation, tends to zero in cold regions and to near unity in hot&#10;regions. Correspondingly, , and so this transition radius increases with&#10;increasing temperature. SPH simulations with particles masses 10 M&#10;numerically result in values at least 3 but can increase by orders of&#10;magnitude for low or large values.&#10;&#10;Beyond the SNR enters the SP phase, in which the blast wave experiences&#10;a significant energy loss via radiative cooling and expands with&#10;relatively constant radial momentum . Residual thermal energy within the&#10;blast wave allows the momentum to increase slightly in this phase and,&#10;according to , is proportional to . Based primarily on the detailed&#10;hydrodynamic simulations of , we describe the thermal energy to transfer&#10;from the SNR to the surrounding medium as where is the total original&#10;kinetic energy of the SNR and is the distance in pc to the medium. The&#10;0.7 factor accounts for the fact that, at the start of the SP phase, the&#10;thermal fraction of the total energy is 70%.&#10;&#10;Similarly, we describe the kinetic energy to transfer from the SNR to&#10;the surrounding medium as Note that since the exponent of the radius&#10;fraction is smaller in Eq. \[E\_K\] than in Eq. \[E\_Th\], the late&#10;stages of the SP phase are dominated by its kinetic energy.&#10;&#10;The resulting deceleration parameter is 0.28 in the type II SN scenario&#10;and 0.47 in the type I SN scenario, where is the velocity of the blast&#10;wave. The values that we have adopted are consistent with those recently&#10;found by , who also found a more rapid deceleration and energy loss than&#10;the value of 0.33 found by .&#10;&#10;[^1]:  tested SN remnant propagation in the range 0.084–8400 cm. They&#10;    found unrealistic results only for the highest-density case, which&#10;    was driven by their assumption of no magnetic fields.&#10;&#10;[^2]: This approximation is valid mostly for gas with K.">

    <outline text="Construction of a New SN Feedback Model" _note="We construct a feedback formulation that considers the three different&#10;SNR phases described in Sec. \[subsubsec:phases\], and we call it&#10;**SP-MODEL** feedback, since it includes the SP phase of SNR evolution.&#10;This model can be applied to both type II and Ia SN explosions. We allow&#10;the model to transfer SN ejecta energy to the closest 10 neighboring gas&#10;particles according to the physics of the SNR phase in which the&#10;neighboring particles happens to lie according to the following recipe:&#10;&#10;If the distance between the gas particle and the SN event is smaller&#10;than (Eq. \[FEradius\]), SN energy is transferred by conserving&#10;momentum, which results in a small fraction of the original SN energy&#10;being transferred as kinetic energy and the rest as thermal energy; we&#10;call this FE FEEDBACK.&#10;&#10;If the distance lies between and (Eq. \[STradius\]), 30% of the SN&#10;energy is transferred as kinetic energy and the rest as thermal energy;&#10;we call this ST FEEDBACK.&#10;&#10;If the distance is larger than , SN energy is transferred as both&#10;kinetic and thermal energy following Eqs. \[E\_Th\] and \[E\_K\]; we&#10;call this SP FEEDBACK.&#10;&#10;The total energy liberated in a typical Type II SN is on the order of 10&#10;erg, but much of the loss is emitted as neutrinos and only 1% goes out&#10;as kinetic energy with the ejecta, or 10 erg. This canonical value for&#10;SN energy in the ejected material is described as where is the velocity&#10;of the ejecta . In our simulations we calculate following the mass yield&#10;prescriptions for type II SNe by and for type Ia SNe by , the former&#10;resulting in a typical ejected mass of 13% of the exploding star. Since&#10;only stars with masses between 8 and 100 M experience type II SNe, the&#10;expected value for falls in the range 3000–10000 km s. We choose km s as&#10;our fiducial value for both type Ia and II SNe.&#10;&#10;Note that each SN event in our simulation corresponds to the energy of&#10;many simultaneous physical SN events, as mandated by simulation&#10;resolution . For a star particle of mass 10 M, the typical value of is&#10;in the order of 10 erg. Fortunately, the same way that Eq. \[E\_SN\]&#10;scales with particle mass, so do Eqs. \[FEradius\]–\[E\_K\], making the&#10;SP-model formulation formally independent of simulation resolution.">

  <outline text="Winds From AGB Stars" _note="As part of the SP-model feedback, we also include feedback from the&#10;low-mass end of the stellar population in the form of slow winds from&#10;AGB stars. Similar to our treatment of winds and metals from young&#10;massive stars (see Sec. \[subsec:youngfb\]), we transfer energy from the&#10;star particles to the surrounding gas particles by conserving momentum&#10;of the ejected material, which is calculated using the mass yield&#10;prescriptions for AGB by .

  <outline text="Isolated Galaxy Simulation" _note="With our simulated galaxy we are recreating a Milky Way-like spiral&#10;galaxy isolated from any outside interference to isolate the effects of&#10;stellar feedback on the evolution of the galaxy dynamics and structure.&#10;The galaxy consists of a DM halo, a rotationally supported disk of gas&#10;and stars, a central stellar bulge, and a hot gas halo. We followed the&#10;method described in and extended by for a hot gas halo to set up close&#10;to equilibrium initial conditions.&#10;&#10;There are DM particles with mass M, for a total DM mass of M and they&#10;are arranged so as to follow the mass distribution profile described by&#10;with a concentration parameter .&#10;&#10;The total baryonic mass is M and is represented by three different&#10;galactic structures: a disk of gas and stars, a stellar bulge, and a hot&#10;( K) gas halo. Almost 80% of the disk is in a stellar disk, while the&#10;other 20% is represented by collisional SPH gas particles each of mass&#10;M. The total mass of the stellar bulge is M. The total mass of the hot&#10;gas halo is M, approximately 4% of the total baryonic mass of the&#10;galaxy.&#10;&#10;We include this diffuse, rotating, hot halo —as described in — to&#10;recreate observed, X-ray emitting, extended hot haloes around moderate&#10;mass, spiral galaxies . The gas halo assumes that there is no angular&#10;momentum transport between it and the spherical DM halo. The median&#10;temperature of the hot halo gas is K and the mean hydrogen density is&#10;cm, similar to the values found for the Milky Way Galaxy by .&#10;&#10;The total galactic mass is 1.4 x M. Up to 95% of the total galactic mass&#10;is contained within 1 Mpc from the galactic center, and 100%, within 8&#10;Mpc. The side length of the cube box is 50 Mpc.&#10;Table \[table:IC\_isolated\] summarizes SPH particle characteristics for&#10;our fiducial initial conditions.&#10;&#10;The galaxy is evolved for 6 Gyr using the fixed gravitational softening&#10;lengths specified in Table \[table:IC\_isolated\] for each particle&#10;type. The gas is converted to stars according to the prescription in&#10;Sec. \[subsec:sfr\] and using the fiducial parameter values described in&#10;Table \[table:params\]. The same softening length that applies to gas&#10;particles also applies to new star particles (see&#10;Table \[table:IC\_isolated\]). Star particles then stochastically&#10;experience one type II SN event after an age Myr. They also experience&#10;continuous type Ia SN events and AGB feedback starting at age 50 Myr and&#10;every 50 Myr after that (see&#10;Secs. \[subsubsec:implementation\]–\[subsec:AGB\]). The disk and bulge&#10;stars from the initial conditions do not contribute to any feedback at&#10;any point in the simulation. All input parameters for the simulation are&#10;summarized in Table \[table:params\].&#10;&#10;Lastly, mass and energy emanating from a star particle from one of the&#10;events described in Sec \[subsec:youngfb\]–\[subsec:AGB\] is distributed&#10;among neighboring gas particles according to their distance from the&#10;star particle using weights calculated by the Wendland kernel . All&#10;velocities added to neighbor gas particles point radially away from the&#10;location of the star particle. This is true for stellar winds from O and&#10;B stars, Strömgren sphere heating, type II and Ia SNe, and AGB winds. We&#10;find that at the end of our simulations the mass range of the newly&#10;formed star particles is 0.7–13.4 M, with a median value of 0.9 M.

<outline text="Results" _note="In addition to a simulation using the SP-model feedback formulation, we&#10;ran two other simulations with the same initial conditions but different&#10;feedback schemes: **NO FEEDBACK**, in which we apply mass transfer but&#10;no energy transfer at all, and **HOT BUBBLE** feedback, in which we&#10;transfer SN energy in purely thermal form to the five closest&#10;neighboring particles. Note that, by construct, the amount of total&#10;kinetic energy transferred is null in these two alternative scenarios.&#10;We compare the results from these two alternative scenarios to the&#10;SP-model results to better evaluate the effect of the SP-model. The most&#10;relevant results from our isolated galaxy simulations are summarized in&#10;Table \[table:results\].&#10;&#10;">
  <outline text="SFR and Galactic Characteristics" _note="The most important effect of the SP-model feedback can be observed in&#10;the star formation history. Fig. \[fig:SFR\_isolated\] shows the SFR for&#10;our isolated galaxy using all three SN feedback schemes considered. The&#10;SFR histories for the three feedback schemes differ more significantly&#10;during the early phases of the simulations, when the presence of&#10;feedback in kinetic form suppress SFR more efficiently. The SP-model&#10;feedback, which most effectively suppresses early star formation, has&#10;the highest rate of late-time star formation, as material partially&#10;ejected by a central “fountain” returns at later times to be&#10;incorporated in late forming stars. Under NO feedback, the current SFR&#10;is 0.23 M yr, compared to a value of 0.94 under Hot bubble feedback and&#10;1.15 M yr under SP-model feedback. The estimated value for the Milky Way&#10;is 0.68–1.45 M yr . Had we allowed for growing torques from&#10;non-axisymmetric tidal forces, these effects would have been more&#10;pronounced .&#10;&#10;The differences in star formation affect several other galactic&#10;characteristics. We therefore measure other important galactic&#10;quantities to better understand the impact of each feedback scheme.&#10;These measurements are shown in Table \[table:results\].&#10;&#10;The strongly suppressed early star formation results in an overall&#10;younger stellar population, as indicated by the age at which half the&#10;new galactic stellar mass is assembled: 1.48 Gyr for SP-model feedback&#10;as opposed to 0.37 Gyr for NO feedback and 0.63 for Hot bubble feedback.&#10;These half ages are indicated by vertical arrows in&#10;Fig. \[fig:SFR\_isolated\].&#10;&#10;The gas outflow rate (OFR) —measured as the cumulative outflow rate of&#10;gas beyond 2 kpc from the plane of the disk over 6 Gyr— suggests the&#10;existence of the strong fountain effect in SP-model: OFR is 0.01 M yr&#10;under NO feedback, 0.37 M yr under Hot bubble feedback, and 0.76 M yr&#10;under SP-model feedback.&#10;&#10;The mass loading factor —measured as the OFR divided by the cumulative&#10;stellar mass produced over 6 Gyr— is a very important metric for&#10;assessing the applicability of the models. For the NO feedback case it&#10;is 0.01, for the Hot bubble feedback case it is 0.36, and for the&#10;SP-model feedback case it is 0.72. found in their study of galactic&#10;winds using high-resolution cosmological simulations —part of the &lt;span&#10;style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Fire&lt;/span&gt; project— that galaxies&#10;similar in size to our fiducial exhibit gusty outflows at high redshift&#10;() but then reach a moderate, steady SFR and subdued, weak outflows at&#10;low redshift (). This translates into values close to 10 at high&#10;redshift and lower than 1 at low redshift[^1].&#10;&#10;The different SFR histories of the three feedback scenarios result in&#10;different stellar populations after 6 Gyr. Table \[table:results\]&#10;includes final halo and galactic characteristics. We define the virial&#10;radius to be , the radius where the mean density drops below 200 times&#10;the critical density of the universe. We then define the galactic radius&#10;to be . The variations across the feedback scenarios of the virial mass&#10;and virial radius are small, as expected. The distinguishable impact of&#10;the SP-model lies in the age and mass distribution of the stellar&#10;population.&#10;&#10;The SP-model feedback generates a flatter disk structure in the inner 4&#10;kpc of the galaxy than NO feedback and Hot bubble feedback.&#10;Fig. \[fig:sigmacurves\] shows surface density —using dm/dr = 2— at&#10;different galactic radii at the end of the simulations for all three SN&#10;feedback scenarios. Another indicator of the spread of stellar content&#10;is the effective radius —the radius of a sphere circumscribing half of&#10;the stellar mass (vertical arrows in Fig. \[fig:sigmacurves\]). is&#10;larger under SP-model feedback NO feedback by a factor of 3.2, but it is&#10;smaller than under Hot bubble feedback by a factor of 0.8. We found no&#10;bar formation in our simulations.&#10;&#10;Fig. \[fig:rot\_isolated\] shows the theoretical circular velocities of&#10;each galactic component for the initial conditions (IC) (top panel), the&#10;NO feedback scenario (upper middle panel), the Hot bubble feedback&#10;scenario (lower middle panel), and the SP-model feedback scenario&#10;(bottom panel). The SP-model feedback creates a significantly flatter&#10;rotational curve for the new stellar component (black solid line)&#10;compared to NO feedback and Hot bubble feedback. Under the SP-model&#10;feedback, the mean for gas and star particles within at the end of the&#10;simulation are 24 km s and 99 km s, respectively, compared to 55 km s&#10;and 69 km s in the initial conditions. Interestingly, the old bulge&#10;stellar component (orange dashed line) ends up with a significantly&#10;flatter rotational curve under the NO feedback and Hot bubble scenarios.&#10;We suspect this is caused by a transfer of angular momentum from the&#10;bulge star particles to the new star particles, as a significant portion&#10;of the star formation occurs near the galactic bulge. The latter is a&#10;direct consequence of the absence of energy transfer in the NO feedback&#10;scenario and lack of kinetic energy feedback in the Hot bubble scenario,&#10;which would otherwise help push out hot gas from star forming regions.&#10;&#10;To compare how stellar populations assemble in the galaxy,&#10;Fig. \[fig:masses\_isolated\] shows a history of stellar (top panel) and&#10;gas (bottom panel) masses within the galactic radius for all three&#10;feedback scenarios. The vertical arrows indicate the time when the&#10;galaxy has assembled half of its new stellar mass. In the NO feedback&#10;scenario (dotted line), the new stellar content of the galaxy&#10;accumulates quickly, whereas any form of energy feedback (Hot bubble or&#10;SP-model) hinders this process significantly. Consequently, gas is very&#10;quickly depleted under NO feedback, as seen in the bottom panel. Both&#10;the Hot bubble and SP-model feedback schemes allow more gas to remain by&#10;either heating it or kicking some of it out of the galaxy early on and&#10;allowing it to later rain back into the disk. After 6 Gyr the&#10;gas-to-stellar-mass ratio is significantly higher when the SP-model is&#10;in place (0.16) compared to NO feedback (0.04).&#10;&#10;[^1]:  presents several different methods to measure for their simulated&#10;    galaxies. Our method is most similar to their CROSS T method, albeit&#10;    with different geometry in the threshold boundary to categorize the&#10;    outflow.">

  <outline text="Energy Transfer" _note="Figs. \[fig:diag\_isolated\_Etransferred\]–\[fig:diag\_isolated\_K-Th\_sp\]&#10;present a breakdown of the energy transferred in type II SN events. They&#10;help to illustrate in more detail how the SP-model feedback distributes&#10;energy to the surrounding medium.&#10;&#10;According to the description of the SP-model feedback in&#10;Sec. \[subsubsec:phases\], some SN energy is radiatively lost during the&#10;SP phase (outside ), whereas no energy is lost during the FE and ST&#10;phases. Therefore, the total amount of energy transferred to gas&#10;particles is not always equal to the original SN energy of the ejecta.&#10;Fig. \[fig:diag\_isolated\_Etransferred\] shows a normalized histogram&#10;of the fraction of type II SN energy released by a star particle that is&#10;actually transferred to neighboring gas particles. In 40% of the cases,&#10;the fraction of the original SN energy transferred is 80% or greater,&#10;either because neighboring gas particles are in FE or ST phase, where no&#10;SN energy is lost, or because they are within the SP phase but not too&#10;far from the ST–SP transition radius , thus allowing only a small&#10;fraction of the original SN ejecta energy to be lost in cooling. By&#10;construct, most of the energy in the FE phase, ST phase, and SP phase&#10;near is in thermal form. On the other hand, 10% of the cases resulted in&#10;an energy transfer less than 20% of the original SN energy transferred&#10;to neighboring gas particles. This is a consequence of gas particles&#10;being far into the SP phase, i.e., well outside the ST–SP transition&#10;radius , where a significant portion of the original SN energy is lost&#10;via radiative cooling. Most of the energy in the SP phase far from is in&#10;kinetic form, as the thermal portion of the remaining energy dissipates&#10;more quickly than the kinetic portion (see Eqs. \[E\_Th\] and \[E\_K\]).&#10;Thus, for the cases where most of the original SN energy is dissipated,&#10;almost all of the energy transferred is in kinetic form.&#10;&#10;Fig. \[fig:diag\_isolated\_PhasesE\] illustrates the fraction of energy&#10;transferred at the different SNR phases as a function of time. Most SN&#10;energy is transferred to gas particles lying within the ST phase (red&#10;region) for three main reasons: first, no energy loss occurs during the&#10;ST phase; second, neighboring gas particles in the ST phase have larger&#10;SPH kernel weights than those in the SP phase; and third, increases as&#10;ISM densities drop, the latter driven by SN feedback. Also, not many gas&#10;particles are found in the FE phase, which is subject to simulation&#10;resolution. Finally, Fig. \[fig:diag\_isolated\_PhasesE\] shows that&#10;during the first 1 Gyr of the simulation the majority of the energy is&#10;transferred to gas particles in the SP phase. According to&#10;Eq. \[STradius\], this indicates that initial high values and low values&#10;— and thus, small — must have shifted to lower and higher values rather&#10;rapidly, which in turn increased , such that after 1 Gyr the energy&#10;transferred in the SP phase decreased from almost 100 to 50% of the&#10;total.&#10;&#10;Fig. \[fig:diag\_isolated\_K-Th\_sp\] shows the fraction of total energy&#10;transferred in the form of kinetic and thermal energy as a function of&#10;time. During the first 1 Gyr, the time during which most energy transfer&#10;occurs in the SP phase, the majority of energy transferred is kinetic.&#10;This drives early strong winds out of the galactic disk, which help&#10;suppress early star formation significantly. Furthermore, the fraction&#10;of energy transferred never falls below 30% (gray dashed line) for 6&#10;Gyr, which illustrates the effect of increasing kinetic energy transfer&#10;when the SP phase is included in SN feedback.&#10;&#10;Lastly, we note that in the extreme case of a large hot volume fraction&#10;, the amount of transferred thermal and kinetic energy approximates the&#10;type of feedback present in the ST phase, not only because the ST–SP&#10;transition radius increases in size (Eq. \[STradius\]), but also because&#10;the radial factor in Eqs. \[E\_Th\] and \[E\_K\] approaches unity. We&#10;tested a simulated galaxy using exclusively ST feedback on all&#10;neighboring gas particles and found that the results were very similar&#10;to the results using the SP-model feedback.">

  <outline text="X-rays" _note="As noted by , a correlation is expected between the hot gas content and&#10;gravitational potential of the galaxy. These authors measured X-ray&#10;emission by hot and diffuse gas in galactic halos in the range 0.3–8 keV&#10;as proxy for the hot gas content, and central velocity dispersion as&#10;proxy for the gravitational potential, on a sample of 30 early-type&#10;galaxies observed with CHANDRA.&#10;&#10;To verify this correlation in our simulated galaxies, we estimate the&#10;total galactic X-ray luminosity using an emissivity prescription,&#10;described in , that includes bremsstrahlung radiation and line emissions&#10;of all tracked species within the 0.3–8 keV band produced by hot ( K)&#10;and diffuse ( g cm) gas halo particles. We then measure circular&#10;velocity as the mass-weighted mean rotational velocity for star&#10;particles within the galactic disk . We compare our values against the&#10;measured in . We convert their values into using . We find that, given&#10;the values of our simulated galaxies, falls within the observed locus&#10;defined in . Fig. \[fig:Lx\_isolated\] shows versus of our isolated&#10;galaxy for all three feedback scenarios. Only small differences are seen&#10;between the three models, with the SP-model feedback resulting in a&#10;value higher than the Hot bubble feedback by a factor of 2. This is&#10;probably caused by the large fraction of kinetic energy transferred to&#10;the disk gas near SN events at early epochs (see&#10;Fig. \[fig:diag\_isolated\_K-Th\_sp\]), which pushes it farther into the&#10;galaxy halo.&#10;&#10;Also, if we consider the mass– relation found by (see bottom panel of&#10;their figure 5) on a large sample of bright galaxies from the Sloan&#10;Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find that given the current total stellar&#10;mass content of our simulated galaxy (5), its halo falls within the&#10;trend observed in the range 10.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Metallicity" _note="Since the different SN feedback mechanisms affect differently the rate&#10;and time of star formation, they also affect the final metal content of&#10;both gas and star particles in the galaxy. As we described in&#10;Sec. \[subsec:sfr\], ejected material from type Ia and II SNe, as well&#10;as from AGB and young massive stellar winds, is composed of several&#10;metal species in addition to hydrogen and helium.&#10;&#10;Under NO feedback, the current median metallicity of the new stellar&#10;mass log(Z/Z) of our simulated galaxy is 0.11 (upper and lower bounds&#10;indicate the 16th and 84th percentiles); under Hot bubble feedback, it&#10;is 0.26; and under the SP-model feedback, it is 0.34. The SP-model&#10;feedback increases stellar metallicity by a factor of 1.7 compared to NO&#10;feedback, and by a factor of 1.2 compared to Hot bubble feedback.&#10;&#10;These values, however, do not account for the fact that we do not track&#10;metallicity for primordial disk and bulge stars in our galaxy.&#10;Therefore, to determine the median metallicity for the entire stellar&#10;content, we estimate the median metallicity of this primordial stellar&#10;mass using the empirical stellar mass–metallicity relation in . These&#10;authors calculated the median and 16 and 84 percentiles of the&#10;distributions in stellar metallicity as a function of stellar mass for a&#10;sample of high-quality SDSS spectra of galaxies that includes both&#10;early- and late-type galaxies. Given the total mass of the primordial&#10;bulge and disk stars in our galaxy (5.3 M), we find that their&#10;metallicity ought to be log(Z/Z) = according to this relation. Using&#10;this value, the mass-weighted stellar metallicity for the entire stellar&#10;mass content of our galaxy under SP-model feedback is . This value is&#10;statistically similar to the one obtained using the relation for a&#10;galaxy with the same total stellar content as ours. We consider this&#10;result only as guidance, since in our isolated galaxy scenario we do not&#10;account for external galactic events —such as mergers or infall of&#10;primordial cosmological gas— that could alter the metal content of&#10;galaxies.&#10;&#10;Fig. \[fig:Metals\] shows the stellar radial metallicity distribution in&#10;the galaxy under NO feedback (blue dotted line), Hot bubble feedback&#10;(red dashed line), and SP-model feedback (solid black line). A linear&#10;regression analysis in the inner part of the disk () indicates that the&#10;stellar metallicity gradient becomes shallower in the SP-model feedback&#10;case () compared to the NO feedback case () and Hot bubble case ().&#10;found for their sample of 62 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey a&#10;mean slope of . These authors did not specify zero points in their&#10;linear fits, and so we used the zero point from our fit to over-plot&#10;their result (gray line) in Fig. \[fig:Metals\].&#10;&#10;The median galactic gas metallicity increases from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.91&#10;under NO feedback, to 9.53 under Hot bubble feedback, to 9.61 under the&#10;SP-model feedback. found a median gas metallicity for galaxies similar&#10;in stellar content to ours of 12 + log(O/H) = in their sample of SDSS&#10;galaxies at . Similarly, measure 12 + log(O/H) = 8.75 for galaxies&#10;similar in stellar content to ours.&#10;&#10;The higher-than expected gas metallicity in our simulated galaxy with&#10;SP-model feedback may also reflect the inclusion of galaxies at higher&#10;redshifts and of early-type galaxies in these empirical samples.&#10;Nevertheless, the trend of higher gas metallicity with the SP-model&#10;suggests that more metal content is reaching more gas in the disk of the&#10;galaxy. The gradient of gas metallicity decreases from (NO feedback) to&#10;-0.01 (SP-model feedback). found for their sample of 306 galaxies from&#10;the CALIFA survey a characteristic slope of (with a zero-point of&#10;12+log(O/H) between 0.3 and 2 ).&#10;&#10;There is an important effect that may also explain our higher than&#10;expected gas metal content. In our own Milky Way galaxy the deuterium&#10;abundance is close to 80% of the primordial abundance, indicating that&#10;inflowing pristine and metal-free gas makes up a non negligible fraction&#10;of the observed local ISM. Thus, if we made allowance for cosmological&#10;infall of gas in our simulations, the metal abundance in our galaxies&#10;would be significantly lower.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Sensitivity to Ejecta Velocity Parameter" _note="To explore the sensitivity of the SP-model scheme to the ejecta velocity&#10;parameter , we re-ran our simulations with the SP-model feedback&#10;changing from our fiducial value of 4500 km s to 3000, 6000, and 7500 km&#10;s. We find that the baryon conversion efficiency — defined as , where —&#10;decreases as increases: goes from 0.042 to 0.032 and 0.024 for , 6000,&#10;and 7500 km s, respectively. Under the NO feedback scenario —which&#10;serves as a proxy for km s, . The mass loading parameter increases with&#10;increasing , from 0.39 to 0.95 and 1.72 for 3000, 6000, and 7500 km s,&#10;respectively. Under the NO feedback scenario, . This highlights the&#10;sensitivity of the fountain effect to the parameter , particularly when&#10;has a value greater than our fiducial. Lastly, the galactic halo is&#10;significantly affected as we increase beyond our fiducial value: the&#10;galactic halo increases by a factor of 11 when we increase from 4500 to&#10;6000 km s, and by a factor of 19 when we increase it to 7500 km s.&#10;&#10;There appears to be an energy feedback threshold —dependent on according&#10;to Eq. \[E\_SN\]— beyond which a nascent galaxy at high redshift is&#10;strongly compromised by SNR winds. Clearly, this threshold is the point&#10;at which the SN ejecta velocity starts reaching the escape velocity of&#10;the system. The ejecta velocity would thus set the limit of the halo&#10;mass below which the resulting stellar mass would be very small. The&#10;peak ratio of stellar to DM mass occurs at stellar mass of 2.2 M, with a&#10;strongly observed decline for lower mass systems, which have lower&#10;escape velocities.">

  <outline text="Comparison of Results at Different Resolution Levels" _note="To test convergence of results at different numerical resolution levels,&#10;we ran low and high resolution simulations in addition to our fiducial&#10;resolution simulation using the SP-model feedback with 10 times lower&#10;and 10 times higher mass resolution, respectively.&#10;Table \[table:resolutions\] describes the SPH particle parameters for&#10;the low and high resolution levels.&#10;&#10;Fig. \[fig:SFR\_res\] compares the SFR amongst the three resolution&#10;levels tested. We find that to first order, SFR converges with&#10;resolution, with the high-resolution case having slightly more spikes of&#10;star formation at very early epochs than the other two cases. Overall,&#10;however, the high resolution case results in higher stellar and gas&#10;content in the galaxy: gas-to-star mass ratio goes from 0.3 in the low&#10;resolution case to 0.6 in the high resolution case. The high resolution&#10;case also results in younger stellar content: increases from 1.4 Gyr in&#10;the low resolution case to 1.8 Gyr in the high resolution case.&#10;&#10;Similarly, to first order, surface density converges with resolution.&#10;However, higher resolution results in a slightly more spread-out,&#10;flatter stellar content.

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="We implement a physically motivated stellar feedback model, including&#10;winds from young and old stars, heating from young massive stars, and a&#10;SN energy feedback formulation (“SP-model”) that allows for cooling of&#10;the original SN ejecta, with the thermal portion dissipating away more&#10;quickly than the kinetic portion. The SP-model mimics the known physics&#10;that takes place during all phase of SNRs —free expansion (FE) phase,&#10;Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase, and snowplow (SP) phase— as revealed by both&#10;observations and high spatial resolution simulations. It also allows for&#10;the important effects of significantly enhanced SN remnant propagation&#10;in a multiphase medium. We implement this on an isolated Milky Way-type&#10;galaxy with a hot gas halo assembled following the methods in using the&#10;improved TreeSPH code SPHGal , and we evolve it for 6 Gyr.&#10;&#10;We also implement wind feedback from both young massive stars and older&#10;AGB stars by conserving momentum of the ejected material. For the&#10;former, we approximate the ejected material to be commensurate both in&#10;mass and velocity with that of type II SN explosions, except that we&#10;spread it evenly during the first 3 Myr of the life of the star&#10;particle. For the latter, we use mass yield prescriptions found in the&#10;literature and an ejecta velocity of 10 km s, and we implement it&#10;throughout several Gyr following type II SN events.&#10;&#10;We also implement two mechanisms that limit cooling of the ISM gas, one&#10;produced by the Strömgren sphere heating surrounding young massive&#10;stars, and the other one produced by the radiative recombination&#10;processes in dense H&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt;&#10;regions.&#10;&#10;In our simulations the SP-model feedback addresses the sub-resolution&#10;physics problem in low resolution SPH simulations in which particle&#10;distances are barely resolved at the level necessary to allow for FE&#10;feedback, the type that many galaxy simulations include. By formulating&#10;a type of SN feedback that occurs mainly during the later stages of an&#10;SNR, namely ST and SP phases, the SP-model feedback allows for a more&#10;accurate representation of the physics involving SN energy feedback.&#10;&#10;Given that both ST and SP phases allow for 30% of the SN ejecta energy&#10;to be transferred in kinetic form, and that during SP phase the thermal&#10;energy fraction dissipates more quickly with distance than the kinetic&#10;fraction, gas particles surrounding SN events receive much stronger&#10;momentum kicks while in the ST and SP phases compared to the FE phase,&#10;in which feedback is driven by ejecta momentum conservation only. The&#10;result of implementing the SP-model feedback is a much flatter SFR&#10;history compared to a purely thermal SN feedback (here called Hot bubble&#10;feedback) and to having no energy feedback at all. As a consequence, the&#10;half age of the formed stars under the SP-model feedback is 4 times&#10;later than under no feedback and 2.3 times later than under Hot bubble&#10;feedback. The final SFR of the galaxy increases by a factor of 1.2 —to&#10;1.15 M yr— as we go from Hot bubble feedback to the SP-model feedback.&#10;&#10;The assembly of the galactic stellar content is more spread out in time&#10;in a galaxy with SP-model feedback, as much of the gas kicked out by the&#10;SNRs at early times eventually falls back to the galaxy, the so-called&#10;galactic “fountain” effect, where it cools off and is subject to star&#10;formation. The SP-model feedback results in a gas outflow rate from the&#10;galaxy of 0.76 M yr, compared to 0.01 M yr under no stellar feedback and&#10;0.37 under Hot bubble feedback. This fountain created by the SP-model&#10;feedback helps alleviate the issue of over clustering of stellar content&#10;at the galactic center, resulting in flatter rotational curves for the&#10;stellar component of the galaxy, flatter surface density curves for the&#10;galactic disk, and an overall larger galactic size, with the effective&#10;radius increasing by a factor of 3.2 as we go from having no stellar&#10;feedback to the SP-model feedback. Furthermore, the SP-model feedback&#10;results in a mass loading parameter of 0.72, versus 0.36 under Hot&#10;bubble feedback and 0.01 under no feedback.&#10;&#10;The integrated stellar metallicity of our galaxy increases by a factor&#10;of 1.7 \[measured as log(Z/Z)\], and gas metallicity, by a factor of 5.0&#10;\[measured as 12+log(O/H)\] as we go from having no stellar feedback to&#10;the SP-model feedback. The stellar metallicity disk gradients turn&#10;shallower under SP-model feedback () compared to Hot bubble feedback ().&#10;&#10;Given that the parameters of the SP-model —phase transition radii,&#10;energy and mass input— all scale with the SPH particle masses, our model&#10;is only weakly dependent on simulation resolution. The SP-model,&#10;however, does not completely address the problem of SN events occurring&#10;in overly dense regions in these simulations, which are a pure&#10;artificial construct of the limitation in spatial resolution. The&#10;unphysical result is SN events occurring in very dense regions that&#10;would otherwise be hollowed out by previous SN explosions.&#10;&#10;In fact, nature has provided the solution: spatially displacing a&#10;significant fraction of type II SN events from their original location&#10;would lead to SN energy being released in less dense regions of the ISM.&#10;Many OB stars are “runaways” —massive stars with high velocity&#10;dispersions resulting from the acceleration given by their SN-exploding,&#10;close binary companions. As points out, close to 40% of type II SN&#10;explosions are from runaway OB stars, with their high velocity&#10;dispersions allowing them to travel up to 100–500 pc from their place of&#10;origin. A significant fraction of Type II SN events would, therefore,&#10;occur in low-density environments such as above the star forming disk or&#10;in inter-spiral arm regions.">
