    <title>Sensitivity estimate of the MACE gamma ray telescope</title>
    <abstract>The MACE (Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment) is a 21 m diameter
-ray telescope which is presently being installed at Hanle in Ladakh,
India (32 46 46 N, 78 58 35 E) at an altitude of 4270 m a.s.l. Once
operational, it will become the highest altitude very high energy (VHE)
-ray telescope in the world based on Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Technique (IACT). In the present work, we discuss the sensitivity
estimate of the MACE telescope by using a substantially large Monte
Carlo simulation database at zenith angle. The sensitivity of MACE
telescope is estimated by carrying out the -hadron segregation using the
Random Forest method. It is estimated that the MACE telescope will have
an analysis energy threshold of 38 GeV for image intensities above 50
photoelectrons. The integral sensitivity for point like sources with
Crab Nebula-like spectrum above 38 GeV is of Crab Nebula flux at 5
statistical significance level in 50 hrs of observation. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Among the various fields of astronomy (Radio, Infrared, Optical,&#10;Ultraviolet, X-rays, -rays, gravitational waves), ground based -ray&#10;astronomy is one of the youngest entrants. This field was pioneered by&#10;the Whipple group who made the first unambiguous detection of TeV -rays&#10;from the Crab Nebula in the year . Subsequently, over the next decade,&#10;-rays were detected from various astrophysical sources . This field has&#10;seen remarkable progress in recent years with the source count&#10;increasing from just a single source in 1989 to 175 confirmed TeV -ray&#10;sources as of now. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT) is&#10;based on detecting the Cherenkov radiation generated by the cosmic -rays&#10;when they enter the Earth’s atmosphere. Presently three major&#10;operational IACT based telescopes are MAGIC , HESS and VERITAS . The&#10;MAGIC telescope consists of two 17 m diameter telescopes at the Canary&#10;island of La Palma. The analysis energy threshold of MAGIC is . The&#10;VERITAS telescope is an array of four 12 m diameter telescopes at&#10;southern Arizona, USA. It has an analysis energy threshold of 135 GeV .&#10;HESS telescope, situated in Namibia, is a mixed array consisting of four&#10;12 m telescopes, named as HESS-I and one 28 m large size telescope,&#10;named as HESS-II. HESS-I alone operates at an analysis energy threshold&#10;of 158 GeV whereas the preliminary simulation studies show that HESS-II&#10;has an analysis energy threshold of 50 GeV . In order to augment the&#10;capability of IACT based telescopes in few GeV to few TeV energy range,&#10;an international consortium of worldwide researchers are setting up an&#10;open observatory known as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) . CTA will&#10;consist of two large arrays of IACT based telescopes, one in the&#10;Northern Hemisphere with an emphasis to study extragalactic objects and&#10;a second array in the Southern Hemisphere to concentrate on galactic&#10;sources. The Southern array which is being set up first will deploy&#10;telescopes of various diameters to cater to the wide energy range of few&#10;tens of GeV to few tens of TeV. A compact array of 4 x 23 m diameter&#10;telescopes will cater to the lower end of energy range.&#10;&#10;In the same endeavour, a new Indian initiative in gamma-ray astronomy,&#10;the Himalayan Gamma Ray Observatory (HIGRO), is setting up an IACT based&#10;telescope known as the [**MACE**]{} ([**M**]{}ajor [**A**]{}tmospheric&#10;[**C**]{}herenkov [**E**]{}xperiment) at Hanle in the Ladakh region of&#10;northern India. MACE, presently being set up at an altitude of 4270m, is&#10;a 21m diameter telescope with a total light collector area of with&#10;effective focal length of . Compared to the high altitude of MACE&#10;telescope, MAGIC, HESS and VERITAS telescopes are operational at an&#10;altitude of 2225 m, 1800 m and 1275 m respectively. The idea of an IACT&#10;based telescope at high altitude (5 km) was introduced by Aharonian et&#10;al. (2006) . They discussed the concept of a stereoscopic array of&#10;several large imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes having an energy&#10;threshold of 5 GeV. Although it should be noted that they discussed&#10;about a stereo array, whereas MACE is a standalone single telescope. The&#10;stereoscopic approach has many advantages compared to the stand alone&#10;IACT. This approach allows unambiguous reconstruction of shower&#10;parameters. It also leads to effective suppression of night sky&#10;background and muon background because of the reduction in the random&#10;coincidences, leading to reduced pixel trigger threshold and hence lower&#10;energy threshold. In addition to it, the hadronic showers are rejected&#10;more efficiently compared to a single IACT based telescope on shape cuts&#10;in multiple views. The simultaneous observation of air shower by&#10;stereoscopic telescope, compared to a single telescope, leads to&#10;improved shower direction reconstruction as well as core location. The&#10;main advantage of having a stereoscopic array of 20 m diameter telescope&#10;at an altitude of 5 km is very low ray energy threshold GeV on account&#10;of less absorption of Cherenkov photon, as well due to geometric effect&#10;on account of higher altitude leading to higher photon density.&#10;&#10;In the present work, we will discuss the preliminary sensitivity&#10;estimate of the MACE telescope. This study is organized as follows. In&#10;section \[intro\], we will introduce the MACE telescope. In section&#10;\[generation\] , we will discuss the generation of Monte Carlo&#10;simulation database along with the technique used in the field of IACT.&#10;Section \[rforest\] will discuss the Random Forest method. In section 5,&#10;we will define the Integral sensitivity and its estimation. Results and&#10;discussion will be presented in section 6. Finally we will conclude the&#10;study along with the planned future studies.">

<outline text="Generation of Monte Carlo simulation database" _note="A Monte Carlo simulation database at 5 zenith angle was generated. The&#10;details are as follows:">
  <outline text="Simulation Database" _note="The extensive air shower (EAS) library for MACE simulation was generated&#10;using a standard air shower simulation package CORSIKA(v6.990). This&#10;code is developed at Karlsruhe university and available for use on&#10;request. This Monte Carlo method based code simulates the secondary&#10;particle cascade generation in the atmosphere as high energy primary&#10;particle enters the Earth’s atmosphere and undergoes many&#10;electromagnetic as well as hadronic interactions. Many models to&#10;simulate these interactions are available in this code and the Cerenkov&#10;light generation by the relativistic leptons as they zip through the&#10;atmosphere is also simulated. For this work, we have used EGS4 model for&#10;the electromagnetic interactions. For low energy (upto 100GeV) hadronic&#10;interactions, we have used GHEISHA model while high energy interactions&#10;are modelled using QGSJet-I model. We have used CEFFIC option to&#10;incorporate the en-route absorption of Cerenkov photon. We have used US&#10;standard atmosphere model supplied with CORSIKA package. The observation&#10;level was set to the altitude of the telescope site. The Earth’s&#10;magnetic field values measured at the Hanle are 31.95 for horizontal&#10;component along local north direction and 38.49 for vertical component&#10;in downwards direction. The Cerenkov photons were stored within the&#10;wavelength range 240 – 650 as the MACE camera PMTs are sensitive in this&#10;range.&#10;&#10;Using this setup, we generated EAS library for four primary particles –&#10;-ray, proton, electron and particle. The spectral indices used are 2.59&#10;for -ray, 2.7 for proton, 3.26 for electron and 2.63 for particle. Other&#10;input parameters which vary with particle type, are listed in Table&#10;\[Table:database\]. In this work we focused on estimating the&#10;sensitivity of the telescope for on-axis point sources only (view cone&#10;angle is maintained at zero value for -ray showers). The protons,&#10;electrons and alpha particles are simulated diffusively in a certain&#10;view cone angles, as described in the Table \[Table:database\]. It&#10;evident from this table that we generated more than 34 million -ray&#10;showers and nearly 1 billion showers for cosmic rays in two energy band&#10;encompassing over 3 decades of energies using three high-end&#10;workstations comprising of 32 processors each during the actual runtime&#10;of more than six months.&#10;&#10;The telescope simulation program took these shower events as input and&#10;ray-traced them to the focal plane of the telescope. This simulation&#10;used the same optical design of the telescope including the pixel layout&#10;in the camera as described in section 2. The two level trigger logic&#10;used in simulation exactly mimics the actual trigger design to be&#10;implemented in the MACE telescope. For triggering criteria , we have&#10;used 9 p.e. as the discrimination threshold for a pixel and the trigger&#10;configuration of 4 CCNN pixels was used.&#10;&#10;For simulation studies, a general purpose IACT simulation code was&#10;employed to asses the performance of the MACE telescope. In brief, the&#10;general purpose simulation code incorporated the specification for the&#10;MACE telescope like camera, reflector and trigger configuration along&#10;with the wavelength dependent photon absorption. A poissonian Night Sky&#10;Background (NSB) background in each pixel was added in this code. The&#10;NSB observation was carried out at the MACE telescope installation site&#10;during 2003 - 2007 using CCD images taken with the Himalayan Chandra&#10;Telescope (HCT). The estimated NSB rate per pixel turns out to be&#10;photoelectrons . The Cherenkon photons falling on the image plane of the&#10;camera underwent usual image analysis procedure developed by Hillas .&#10;The spatial distribution (of Cherenkov photons) generates different&#10;patterns for signal (-rays generated Cherenkov photons) as well as for&#10;background (Protons, Electrons, Alpha generated Cherenkov photons)&#10;events. This difference in shape and size is exploited for the&#10;extraction of signal. A typical schematic representation of Hillas&#10;parameters is shown in Figure \[Figure:image\].&#10;&#10;\[fig\_had\]&#10;&#10;Conventional practice of image cleaning was employed. We used picture&#10;and boundary thresholds of 10 and 5 respectively. The clean Cerenkov&#10;images were characterized by various Hillas image parameters like&#10;[LENGTH, WIDTH, DISTANCE, SIZE, FRAC2 AND ALPHA]{}. The rms spread of&#10;Cherenkov light along the major/minor axis of image is known as the&#10;[LENGTH/WIDTH]{} of an image. A first level measure of -initiated&#10;extensive air showers core distance is given by the Distance parameter.&#10;It represents the distance from the image centroid to the position of&#10;-ray source in the field of view. The compactness parameter is known as&#10;Frac2. It is defined as the ratio of the sum of the two highest pixel&#10;signal to the sum of all the signals. The total number of photoelectrons&#10;in a Cherenkov image is represented by the size parameter. The parameter&#10;[ALPHA]{} is the angle of the image between a line joining the centroid&#10;of the image to the centre of the field of view. It is a measure of the&#10;orientation of the shower axis. The -ray initiated showers are pointed&#10;towards the centre of the imaging camera and hence have very small value&#10;of [ALPHA]{} compared to the angles subtended by the background events&#10;on account of their isotropic distribution. Asymmetry parameter is&#10;defined as the third moment of the intensity distribution along the&#10;major axis. It describes the skew of the image along its major axis.&#10;&#10;In the present work, we have used Length, Width, Distance, Frac2, Size&#10;and Asymmetry Hillas parameters. In addition to these parameters, we&#10;have used an additional parameter, known as the [LEAKAGE]{} parameter.&#10;It is defined as the ratio between the light content in the camera two&#10;outer most pixel rings to the total light content. Leakage is used as a&#10;precut parameter. We have applied a leakage cut of 10% in this study.&#10;This cut removes events showing a concentration of more than 10 % of the&#10;image size in the two outermost pixel rings. If such events are not&#10;rejected, it lead to a general distortion of the image parameters. A&#10;typical profile plot for [LENGTH]{} and [WIDTH]{} parameters with&#10;[SIZE]{} for Monte Carlo gamma and protons is shown in Figure&#10;\[Figure:noele\]. We have also shown the Length and width distribution&#10;of and protons with Energy is shown in Figure \[Figure:lwedist\]. This&#10;Figure is shown in the Appendix.">

<outline text="Random Forest" _note="Random Forest (RF) is one of the many flexible multivariate machine&#10;learning methods. The algorithm for RF was developed by Leo Breiman and&#10;Adele Cutler and can be used for classification and regression problems.&#10;Random Forest is an ensemble of simple tree predictors where each tree&#10;makes a prediction and final prediction is made by aggregating over the&#10;ensemble. A nice description of Random Forest methods is given in . The&#10;classification tree forms the basic building block of Random Forest&#10;method. It is constructed by binary recursively partitioning the data&#10;set. Each partitioning splits the data sets into different branches. In&#10;the present work, the basic aim of the application of Random Forest is&#10;to segregate Cherenkov photons generated by the cosmic -rays from the&#10;background consisting of the Cherenkov photons generated from other&#10;cosmic ray particles like protons, electrons and alpha particles. For&#10;this purpose, the present problem is treated as a binary classification&#10;problem where one of the classes is to be segregated from the other&#10;class consisting of protons, electrons and alpha particles. Each entry&#10;of training sample consisting of two classes are known as EVENTS. Each&#10;event is characterized by a vector containing various image (Hillas)&#10;parameters defined earlier.&#10;&#10;The cuts on the dataset are generated by taking the various components&#10;of vector having various Hillas parameter. In the present work, we used&#10;a simulation database with details shown in Table \[Table:database\]. We&#10;used 35000 events of each species for the training purpose. Rest of the&#10;triggered events were used as a test sample. In this study, we have used&#10;the original RF code implemented in Fortran [^1]. One of the strengths&#10;of RF is that there are only two parameters which are to be tuned to&#10;minimize the prediction error. One parameter is known as MTRY, i.e.&#10;number of input variables chosen randomly at each split and the second&#10;parameter is NTREE, i.e. the number of trees to be generated. There is&#10;another parameter, known as NODESIZE which decides the minimum number of&#10;data points after which the binary partitioning is stopped. We generated&#10;a total of 500 trees each and used mtry = 2,3. Both the values of mtry&#10;gave similar results. The parameter NODESIZE was kept as 10. An event is&#10;classified as -like or non -like on the basis of hadronness parameter.&#10;The hadronness of two samples of gamma and hadrons is shown in Figure&#10;\[Figure:hadronness\].&#10;&#10;[^1]: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/∼breiman/RandomForests">

<outline text="Integral Sensitivity" _note="The sensitivity of a gamma-ray telescope is determined by its ability to&#10;detect gamma-ray signal in overwhelming presence of cosmic ray&#10;background. The sensitivity of a telescope depends on the area over&#10;which the detector is sensitive to the events. This area is known as the&#10;effective area of the telescope. For an IACT based telescope this&#10;effective area is orders of magnitude bigger than the size of the light&#10;collector. The effective area of MACE telescope for the -rays&#10;originating from an on-axis point source is estimated by integrating the&#10;total retention factor for -rays over all the core distances from the&#10;telescope, as shown in the equation \[eq:g\_eff\]. Normally, the&#10;effective area is also a function of zenith angle but since we are&#10;reporting the results at a particular zenith angle, the zenith angle&#10;dependence is not shown explicitly. \[eq:g\_eff\] Here, is the total&#10;retention factor for -rays and it includes the trigger retention factor&#10;as well as the retention factor due to -selection cut. If is the number&#10;of events used in the simulation and is the number of events triggered&#10;the telescope as well as selected on the basis of -selection cut as&#10;described above then the total retention factor is defined as, Similarly&#10;the effective area for each of the cosmic ray particles (protons,&#10;electron and particles) is estimated by integrating its respective total&#10;retention factor at different core distances over all the core distances&#10;as well as over all the angles within the view-cone solid angle around&#10;the optic axis of the telescope as shown in the following equation; And&#10;the total retention factor for cosmic ray particles is determined in&#10;same manner as in the case of -rays and is shown below, The trigger&#10;effective areas for -rays and all the three cosmic ray species are shown&#10;in the left panel of Figure \[Figure:EA\]. The after-analysis effective&#10;area, , for -rays is shown in the right panel of Figure \[Figure:EA\]&#10;along with the trigger effective area for direct comparison. We also&#10;estimated the “analysis effective area” by applying the hadronness cut&#10;value of 0.9 with size 50 photoelectrons. The value of hadronness is&#10;chosen by optimizing the sensitivity.&#10;&#10;It is clear from the right panel of Figure \[Figure:EA\] that the&#10;analysis effective area for rays for the MACE telescope is much lower&#10;than the trigger effective area. This effect is especially visible for&#10;higher energies. The effective area above 1 TeV shows large fluctuations&#10;on account of poor shower statistics.&#10;&#10;The integral sensitivity of an IACT telescope is determined by&#10;calculating the minimum detectable integral flux of gamma-rays from&#10;Crab-like source having energies more than pre-determined threshold&#10;energy at confidence level in 50 hours of observation. The threshold&#10;energy used in this estimation is the energy at which the differential&#10;rate of gamma-ray events having sizes more than certain pre-determined&#10;size is maximum. For integral sensitivity estimation for MACE telescope,&#10;we have used 50 p.e. as minimum size and subsequently the size is&#10;increased by 1.5 times the earlier value. For each size value we&#10;demanded that the source flux for energies more than the threshold&#10;energy should be such that the significance as defined by equation&#10;(\[sigeq\]) had to be in 50 hours of observation time and also at least&#10;10 -rays should be selected. Here, is the number of -rays selected after&#10;the analysis as described in the earlier section and it is defined by&#10;the following equation, We have used Crab Nebula spectrum as measured by&#10;HEGRA for this calculation. And the effective area is calculated using&#10;equation (\[effagamma\]). Similarly the number of cosmic ray particles&#10;selected after the analysis are estimated using the following equation,&#10;Here, is the cosmic rays spectrum for protons, electrons and alpha&#10;particles as reported in Saino et al. (2004) and Wiebel-Sooth et&#10;al.(1998) . The cosmic ray flux is assumed to be isotropic within the&#10;view-cone solid angle.&#10;&#10;Armed with all the required parameters, here we have estimated the&#10;sensitivity curve of the MACE telescope. The analysis energy threshold&#10;[^1] for the MACE telescope is 38 GeV corresponding to 50 p.e. but it&#10;does not offer the best sensitivity. The integral sensitivity for point&#10;like sources with Crab Nebula-like spectrum above 38 GeV is of Crab&#10;Nebula flux at 5 statistical significance level in 50 hrs of&#10;observation. The integral sensitivity of the MACE telescope is shown in&#10;Figure \[Figure:specs\]. Along with the MACE sensitivity, we have also&#10;shown the sensitivity of the MAGIC-I telescope . It is clear from Figure&#10;\[Figure:specs\] that compared to the MAGIC-I telescope, MACE telescope&#10;will have a lower energy threshold (as expected on account of higher&#10;altitude). Also, it is clear that MACE telescope will be more sensitive&#10;than the MAGIC-I telescope upto 150 GeV.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The energy at which differential rate curve for a particular&#10;    progenitor particle above a certain size range peaks, is called the&#10;    THRESHOLD ENERGY of the telescope for that particle">

<outline text="Results and Discussion" _note="We have estimated the sensitivity of the MACE telescope where the&#10;-hadron segregation was carried out by employing the Random Forest&#10;method. The sensitivity was estimated by generating a substantially&#10;large Monte Carlo simulation database at zenith angle. We generated EAS&#10;for various relevant cosmic ray species (, Proton, Electron, alpha&#10;particles). The MACE telescope is very sensitive in the low energy&#10;range, especially below GeV. The analysis energy threshold of MACE&#10;telescope turns out to be GeV for size cut 50 photoelectrons. It will be&#10;able to detect a minimum of Crab flux in 50 hrs of observation. Since&#10;MACE telescope in the present study will operate in mono mode, it is&#10;worthwhile to compare the sensitivity of the MACE telescope with respect&#10;to the MAGIC-I telescope. Figure \[Figure:specs\] shows that MACE&#10;telescope is able to achieve a better analysis energy threshold energy&#10;of GeV whereas the analysis energy threshold energy of the MAGIC-I&#10;telescope is GeV. Apart from the lower energy threshold, MACE telescope&#10;appears to be more sensitive than the MAGIC-I telescope up to an energy&#10;of GeV. The high altitude of MACE telescope compared to the MAGIC-I&#10;telescope leads to a lower energy threshold compared to the MAGIC-I&#10;telescope. It was demonstrated that stereoscopic array of 20 m diameter&#10;IACTs based telescope installed at an altitude of km can achieve a ray&#10;threshold energy of GeV. Therefore, the MACE telescope on account of&#10;higher altitude is expected to achieve a low energy threshold. It is&#10;also shown that for a m altitude, the Cherenkov photon density is ,&#10;while for Hanle altitude it is up to a core distance of m for rays of&#10;energy 10 GeV. The increase in Cherenkov photon density with increasing&#10;altitude is more pronounced for ray showers than hadron showers.&#10;Therefore the trigger probability for ray showers is more than trigger&#10;probability for hadron showers leading to better performance of MACE&#10;telescope in the sub 100 GeV energy range.&#10;&#10;.&#10;&#10;To obtain an immediate source list which can be observed for the&#10;estimated sensitivity of MACE telescope, we considered the sources&#10;listed in second high energy Fermi catalogue . These sources are&#10;detected by Fermi in the 50 GeV – 2 TeV energy range over seven years of&#10;its operation. To select sources we used the following criteria,&#10;&#10;the source should be visible from the site of MACE telescope.&#10;&#10;the source should have at least 3 detection in Fermi energy range 171&#10;GeV – 585 GeV (second energy band listed in the catalog).&#10;&#10;the source should have non-zero TS value, signifying mere detection by&#10;Fermi, in the Fermi energy range 585 GeV – 2 TeV (third energy band&#10;listed in the catalog).&#10;&#10;Above criteria have been set because MACE telescope is most sensitive&#10;around 100GeV and sources in Fermi catalog having 3 detection in 171 GeV&#10;– 585 GeV energy range generally have more than 5 detection in 50 GeV –&#10;171 GeV energy range. Therefore those sources are the best choice to&#10;study the performance of the MACE telescope. The Fermi observed spectra&#10;of the selected sources along with the MACE sensitivity curve are shown&#10;in Figure \[fig:senssrc\] for comparison. It shows that MACE is expected&#10;to detect many more new sources in future. Table \[Table:2fhl\] lists&#10;the sources selected from the second Fermi high energy catalogue visible&#10;to the MACE telescope. The list of these sources is given in the&#10;appendix.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="We have presented the sensitivity estimate of the MACE telescope. The&#10;salient features of the MACE are:&#10;&#10;The MACE telescope is presently being set up at Hanle, Ladakh, India at&#10;an altitude of 4270 meters. Once operational, it will become the highest&#10;altitude VHE telescope working on the IACT.&#10;&#10;Due to its high altitude, MACE telescope is able to achieve analysis&#10;energy threshold of 38 GeV.&#10;&#10;The integral sensitivity for point like sources with Crab Nebula-like&#10;spectrum above 38 GeV is of Crab Nebula flux at 5 statistical&#10;significance level in 50 hrs of observation.&#10;&#10;The sensitivity of the MACE telescope below 150 GeV (-ray energy) is&#10;better than the MAGIC-I telescope.&#10;&#10;From second Fermi high energy catalogue, we selected sources which are&#10;visible at Hanle site and are significantly detected by Fermi/LAT. From&#10;Figure \[fig:senssrc\], it is evident that MACE will detect these&#10;sources.&#10;&#10;In order to estimate the sensitivity of the MACE telescope in all the&#10;zenith angle ranges, we are generating a similar Monte Carlo simulation&#10;database.It has been shown by the MAGIC group that for a single dish&#10;telescope, by using the timing information, background gets reduced by a&#10;factor two, which in turn results in an enhancement of about a factor&#10;1.4 of the flux sensitivity to point-like sources . We have also&#10;initiated a study to include the timing information of the Cherenkov&#10;pulses in estimating the revised sensitivity of the MACE telescope.">
