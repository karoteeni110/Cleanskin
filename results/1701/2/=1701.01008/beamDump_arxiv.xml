    <title>Simulation study of a passive plasma beam dump using varying plasma
density</title>
    <abstract>A plasma beam dump uses the collective oscillations of plasma electrons
to absorb the kinetic energy of a particle beam. In this paper, a
modified passive plasma beam dump scheme is proposed using either a
gradient or stepped plasma profile to maintain a higher decelerating
gradient compared to a uniform plasma. The improvement is a result of
the plasma wavelength change preventing the re-acceleration of low
energy particles. Particle-in-cell simulation results show that both
stepped and gradient plasma profiles can achieve improved energy loss
compared to a uniform plasma for an electron bunch of parameters
routinely achieved in laser wakefield acceleration. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The safe operation of a particle accelerator requires that the beam be&#10;disposed of once it has been used. This is usually achieved using a&#10;dense material such as a metal, graphite or water. Such a conventional&#10;beam dump can stop even a very high energy electron beam in a relatively&#10;short distance. For example, the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP)&#10;used a long aluminium dump to stop a electron beam and the proposed&#10;water-based dump for the International Linear Collider (ILC) is designed&#10;to stop a beam in . However, the high density of the stopping medium and&#10;high power of the beam lead to a number of disadvantages for a&#10;conventional dump. Both proton and electron beams lead to the production&#10;of radionuclides in the stopping material . The dump must be capable of&#10;absorbing the high power of the beam ( for the ILC) in a small volume,&#10;leading to high power density cooling requirements and high temperatures&#10;and pressures . The ILC beam dump design would operate at and at a&#10;maximum water temperature of . In the case of a water dump,&#10;decomposition generates hydrogen and oxygen gas which must be removed .&#10;In addition, structural materials may suffer radiation damage and lose&#10;strength, a concern for pressure vessels and windows . These&#10;considerations lead to a conventional beam dump being substantially&#10;larger than the length over which they are able to stop their beam may&#10;suggest. For instance, the proposed ILC dump will require a pumping&#10;station, water tower, catalytic hydrogen-oxygen recombiner, and&#10;deionizer sited above ground, connected via pipes to the dump location.&#10;A sump is also required to collect any radioactive water that may leak&#10;from the dump and ancillary equipment .&#10;&#10;One proposed alternative to a high density beam dump uses a beam pipe&#10;filled with a noble gas at atmospheric pressure, surrounded by iron&#10;cladding. With a length of the power deposited per unit length is&#10;greatly reduced . Heat can be dissipated by a simple water cooling&#10;jacket at atmospheric pressure and radio-activation is reduced compared&#10;to the baseline ILC design. However, the disadvantage of this scheme is&#10;the extremely long length required to stop a high energy beam and the&#10;associated costs of providing space for such a dump.&#10;&#10;Another dump scheme, focused on in this paper, uses a plasma wakefield&#10;to decelerate a bunch at a high gradient . The plasma beam dump&#10;minimizes radio-activation by operating at a low density even compared&#10;to a gas dump, and potentially allows for the recovery of some of the&#10;beam energy as electricity rather than dissipation as heat . The high&#10;decelerating gradients achievable with high density ultrashort bunches&#10;such as those produced by laser wakefield acceleration make plasma beam&#10;dumps suitable to complement compact accelerators with compact beam&#10;disposal.&#10;&#10;In this paper, Section \[sec:comparison\] compares the plasma beam dump&#10;with the conventional beam dump. Section \[sec:dump\_schemes\] discusses&#10;the use of modified plasma profiles to improve the performance of a&#10;passive plasma beam dump and Section \[sec:results\] presents&#10;particle-in-cell simulation results for a range of plasma beam dump&#10;parameters using fixed beam parameters.">

<outline text="Plasma beam dump and conventional beam dump compared" _note="The stopping power, i.e. the average loss of energy with distance, of an&#10;electron in a neutral medium depends on its energy. At high energies,&#10;losses are dominated by bremsstrahlung. The critical energy may be&#10;defined as the energy at which losses due to bremsstrahlung are equal to&#10;losses due to other factors e.g. ionization. The critical energy in MeV&#10;is approximated by where is the atomic number of the stopping material .&#10;For high- materials such as lead or copper, bremsstrahlung dominates at&#10;any relevant energy. For lower materials such as water, bremsstrahlung&#10;is dominant above a few hundred MeV. The stopping power due to radiation&#10;is given by: where is the fine structure constant, is the incident&#10;particle mass, is the electron density of the stopping material, is the&#10;elementary charge, is the relativistic gamma factor and is the speed of&#10;light, with all quantities in CGS units. As long as bremsstrahlung is&#10;dominant, the stopping power is linearly proportional to the kinetic&#10;energy of the incident particles, .&#10;&#10;In a plasma medium, an electron bunch is decelerated by collective&#10;oscillations of the electrons in the plasma. The plasma wakefield may be&#10;excited by the beam itself in a passive beam dump, or excited by a laser&#10;pulse in an active beam dump. The plasma may be preformed or, if the&#10;driver is of sufficient intensity, be a neutral gas ionized by the&#10;driver itself . A field-ionized plasma would make the passive dump&#10;simple and reliable. A passive beam dump has recently been demonstrated&#10;experimentally over a short distance using a laser-accelerated bunch .&#10;&#10;The passive dump does however suffer from a major limitation of being&#10;unable to decelerate the head of the bunch due to the finite response&#10;time of the plasma. This problem can be addressed by the active beam&#10;dump, in which the beam is decelerated by the wakefield of a laser pulse&#10;. An active beam dump however relies on the provision of a laser pulse&#10;and accurate synchronization. Without either the dump would fail to stop&#10;the beam and a backup dump would need to be available.&#10;&#10;Recent experimental results have shown that an electron beam can be&#10;decelerated by a plasma when initially offset transversely from the&#10;plasma column . The electron beam is attracted by the charge imbalance&#10;created by the beam’s transverse fields. In a plasma beam dump employing&#10;a pre-formed plasma, this phenomenon would allow the requirements on&#10;alignment of the bunch and plasma column width to be relaxed,&#10;potentially improving the reliability of the dump.&#10;&#10;The highest decelerating gradients for a given plasma density can be&#10;achieved in the non-linear regime, where the bunch density exceeds the&#10;plasma density. The limit on the maximum decelerating gradient is the&#10;wave-breaking field , which depends on the electron plasma frequency :&#10;where is the electron mass, is the permittivity of free space and is the&#10;plasma electron density, and all quantities are in SI units.&#10;&#10;The limit of the wave-breaking field for a plasma density of can be&#10;compared with a copper beam dump for an electron beam of . Equation&#10;\[stopping\_power\] gives an initial average decelerating gradient of&#10;compared with a wave-breaking field of . The actual decelerating&#10;gradient that can be achieved in a plasma depends on the properties of&#10;the electron bunch. A short bunch with density higher than the plasma&#10;density can achieve a gradient approaching the wave-breaking limit as&#10;has been demonstrated experimentally .">

<outline text="Plasma beam dump schemes" _note="The simplest version of a plasma beam dump is a uniform plasma into&#10;which the particle bunch to be decelerated propagates. The head of the&#10;bunch will experience no decelerating field, while some part of the&#10;bunch will experience a maximum decelerating field. After some time the&#10;part of the bunch that experiences the maximum field will become&#10;non-relativistic and will fall behind the rest of the bunch until it&#10;reaches an accelerating region of the wakefield. The portion of the&#10;bunch will then absorb energy from the wakefield and be re-accelerated.&#10;This leads to the rate of energy loss of the bunch dramatically&#10;decreasing after a saturation length , as a substantial proportion of&#10;the energy lost is reabsorbed. The saturation length for a beam of&#10;initial energy is approximately the propagation length at which the&#10;maximum decelerating gradient decelerates a portion of the beam to&#10;non-relativistic velocity: Wu [ET AL.]{} proposed to use a structured&#10;plasma consisting of a series of foils starting after to absorb the low&#10;energy particles and prevent them from being re-accelerated . The&#10;presence of thin foils in the path of a high power beam, and the&#10;potential for high temperatures and electric fields in the plasma may&#10;lead to damage to the foils. A scheme that achieves the same result&#10;using a plasma-only decelerating medium may be attractive.">
  <outline text="Varying plasma density" _note="As an alternative to the use of foils to absorb low energy particles,&#10;the decelerated particles can be removed from the accelerating region of&#10;the wakefield by defocusing. This can be achieved by increasing the&#10;plasma density once the bunch has travelled over the saturation length.&#10;The plasma wavelength is related to the plasma electron density by:&#10;where all quantities are in SI units. As the density increases the&#10;plasma wavelength decreases, effectively shifting the bunch within the&#10;wakefield. Half of one plasma wavelength behind the drive bunch is the&#10;region of highest on-axis electron density. If the plasma density is&#10;increased, decelerated particles will pass through a strong defocusing&#10;region and be removed from the axis. This will prevent their&#10;re-acceleration. For a stepped plasma, the change in plasma wavelength&#10;is instantaneous and the decelerated particles do not need to pass&#10;through the accelerating region. For a gradual plasma density increase&#10;the decelerated particles will gain energy in the accelerating region&#10;prior to being defocused. Figure \[density\_diagrams\] shows a diagram&#10;of the stepped and gradient plasma density schemes. The rate of change&#10;with position of the plasma wavelength can be calculated for a given&#10;plasma profile, by taking the derivative of (Equation&#10;\[plasma\_wavelength\]) with respect to . For a linearly increasing&#10;plasma density from initial density to a final density over a length :&#10;&#10;In the linear regime, the defocusing region is located behind the&#10;maximum decelerating region. The propagation distance over which the&#10;plasma wavelength changes by can be estimated assuming that the rate of&#10;change of plasma wavelength is constant, and the energy gain is the&#10;average accelerating field multiplied by the propagation distance. where&#10;is the initial plasma wavelength at a given position . The more rapid&#10;the change in plasma density, the less energy will be gained by the&#10;decelerated particles, however the density has to remain low enough to&#10;be achievable and to generate a high decelerating field. In this study&#10;the density was increased by a factor of ten over the plasma length.&#10;Linear and quadratic plasma density changes were considered. Figure&#10;\[gradient\_energy\_gain\] shows a plot of the distance required for the&#10;plasma wavelength to change by . A quadratic density profile maintains&#10;the rate of plasma wavelength change at a higher level compared to a&#10;linear density ramp. This will lead to reduced re-acceleration and thus&#10;a more effective beam dump.&#10;&#10;">

<outline text="Simulation results" _note="Two-dimensional simulations of passive beam dump schemes were carried&#10;out using the explicit particle-in-cell (PIC) code VSim . Bunch&#10;parameters were chosen to represent a bunch that can be generated&#10;routinely by laser wakefield acceleration . The bunch has an rms length&#10;of , rms radius of and charge of . The total energy of the bunch is&#10;corresponding a bunch which may be generated by a modest laser pulse of&#10;assuming laser to bunch efficiency . A moderate energy of allows the&#10;simulation length to be kept short. A plasma length allows the&#10;deceleration to saturate and for modified density schemes to be studied.&#10;An initial plasma density of was used, for a range of step lengths and&#10;for linear and quadratically increasing plasma density after the&#10;saturation length. For the gradient plasma schemes the density was&#10;increased by a factor of 10 starting from the saturation length and&#10;ending at the end of the plasma. The step schemes increased the plasma&#10;density by for each step. The step length refers to the length of the&#10;flat plasma density between each step.&#10;&#10;Figure \[energy\_plots\] shows the change in total beam energy for&#10;different dump schemes. The gradient scheme proved to provide the&#10;greatest energy loss over . Figure \[longPhaseSpaceComparison\] shows&#10;the longitudinal phase space for a uniform plasma and a stepped plasma&#10;profile. In each plot the bunch has propagated in the plasma, some&#10;distance beyond the saturation length of approximately . It can be seen&#10;that significantly less charge is re-accelerated in the case of the&#10;gradient profile. In the region , outside the extent of the initial&#10;bunch, at there was found to be of charge re-accelerated to greater than&#10;. This compares with only in the gradient plasma density case. Figure&#10;\[transPhaseSpaceComparison\] shows a plot of energy and transverse&#10;position at the same propagation distance. The lowest energy part of the&#10;bunch has been defocused while the higher energy particles have not been&#10;affected. The defocused particles are limited to less than approximately&#10;. A comparison of the initial and final energy spectra for the linear&#10;ramp case is shown in Figure \[gradient\_energy\_spectrum\]. Although&#10;the peak energy of the bunch remains largely unchanged, the intensity of&#10;particles at the initial central energy has been reduced by a factor of&#10;10. The relativistic at the peak intensity of the final bunch&#10;corresponds to an energy of approximately .&#10;&#10; \[spectrum\_gradient\]">

<outline text="Conclusion and outlook" _note="Simulation results show that a short, moderate charge electron bunch can&#10;lose a large fraction of its energy in a plasma. Stepped and gradient&#10;plasma profiles are capable of improving energy loss and provide an&#10;alternative to the previously proposed foil scheme. Gradient plasma&#10;profiles were found to be most effective in improving energy loss,&#10;however there was relatively little difference between the linear and&#10;quadratic plasma profiles. The advantage of the gradient scheme suggests&#10;that the energy gain of non-relativistic particles while the plasma&#10;wavelength changes is not significant for the parameters used. However,&#10;this may not be the case when bunch parameters are such that the&#10;accelerating gradient is very large. The achievability of the modified&#10;plasma density profiles will depend on the technology used for the&#10;source, which will in turn depend on the beam and plasma parameters.&#10;Such considerations will be important if such a passive plasma beam dump&#10;is to be experimentally tested in the future.&#10;&#10;Plasma beam dumps show great promise in both providing compact&#10;deceleration to complement high-gradient novel accelerators and in&#10;reducing the complexity of beam dumps in conventional accelerators.&#10;Although passive plasma beam dumps are not capable of decelerating the&#10;head of the bunch, the rapid reduction in total beam energy would allow&#10;for a conventional beam dump to absorb the remaining energy with greatly&#10;reduced radio-activation and cooling requirements.&#10;&#10;This work was supported by the Cockcroft Institute Core Grant and the&#10;STFC.
