    <title> Dirichlet’s and Thomson’s principles for non-selfadjoint elliptic
operators with application to non-reversible metastable diffusion
processes.</title>
    <abstract>We present two variational formulae for the capacity in the context of
non-selfadjoint elliptic operators. The minimizers of these variational
problems are expressed as solutions of boundary-value elliptic
equations. We use these principles to provide a sharp estimate for the
transition times between two different wells for non-reversible
diffusion processes. This estimate permits to describe the metastable
behavior of the system. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="This article is divided in two parts. In the first one, we present two&#10;variational formulae which extend the classical Dirichlet’s and&#10;Thomson’s principles to non-selfadjoint elliptic operators. In the&#10;second one, we use these formulae to describe the metastable behavior of&#10;a non-reversible diffusion process in a double-well potential field.&#10;&#10;Fix a smooth, bounded, domain (open and connected) , , and a smooth&#10;function . Denote by the set of functions such that on , the boundary of&#10;. The classical Dirichlet’s principle states that the energy is&#10;minimized on by the harmonic function on which takes the value at the&#10;boundary, that is, by the solution of&#10;&#10;When , where are smooth domains, and , on , , respectively, the minimal&#10;energy is called the capacity. In electrostatics, it corresponds to the&#10;total electric charge on the conductor held at unit potential and&#10;grounded at . It is denoted by and can be represented, by the divergence&#10;theorem, as where is the harmonic function which solves , is the outward&#10;normal vector to , and the surface measure at .&#10;&#10;These results have long been established for self-adjoint operators of&#10;the form , provided , , are smooth, positive-definite, symmetric&#10;matrices, and is a smooth potential. They have been extended, more&#10;recently, by Pinsky to the case in which the operator is not&#10;self-adjoint. In this situation, the minimization formula for the&#10;capacity, mentioned above, has to be replaced by a minmax problem.&#10;&#10;The first main result of this article provides two variational formulae&#10;for the capacity in terms of divergence-free flows. In contrast with the&#10;minmax formulae, the first optimization problem is expressed as an&#10;infimum, while the second one is expressed as a supremum, simplifying&#10;the task of obtaining lower and upper bounds for the capacity.&#10;&#10;Analogous Dirichlet’s and Thomson’s principles were obtained by&#10;Gaudillière and Landim (the Dirichlet’s principle) and by Slowik (the&#10;Thomson principle) for continuous-time Markov chains.&#10;&#10;In the second part of the article, we use the formulae for the capacity&#10;to examine the metastable behavior of a non-reversible diffusion in a&#10;double well potential.&#10;&#10;Let be a smooth, double-well potential which diverges at infinity, and&#10;let be a non-symmetric, positive-definite matrix. We impose in&#10;Section \[sec3\] further assumptions on . Denote by the transpose of and&#10;by its symmetric part. Consider the diffusion , , described by the SDE&#10;where is a standard -dimensional Brownian motion, and is the symmetric,&#10;positive-definite square root of , i.e., .&#10;&#10;Assume that has two local minima, denoted by , , separated by a single&#10;saddle point , and that . The stationary state of , given by , is&#10;concentrated in a neighborhood of when the previous inequality is&#10;strict.&#10;&#10;If starts from a neighborhood of , it remains there for a long time in&#10;the small noise limit until it overcomes the potential barrier and jumps&#10;to a neighborhood of through the saddle point . Denote by the hitting&#10;time of a neighborhood of . The asymptotic behavior of the mean value of&#10;as has been the object of many studies.&#10;&#10;The Arrhenius’ law asserts that the mean value is logarithmic equivalent&#10;to the potential barrier: , where represents the expectation of the&#10;diffusion starting from . The sub-exponential corrections, known as the&#10;Eyring-Kramers formula , have been computed when the matrix is symmetric&#10;and the potential non-degenerate at the critical points. Assuming that&#10;the Hessian of the potential is positive definite at and that it has a&#10;unique negative eigenvalue at , denoted by , while all the others are&#10;strictly positive, the sub-exponential prefactor is given by where as&#10;vanishes.&#10;&#10;This estimate appears in articles published in the 60’s. A rigorous&#10;proof was first obtained by Bovier, Eckhoff, Gayrard, and Klein with&#10;arguments from potential theory, and right after by Helffer, Klein and&#10;Nier through Witten Laplacian analysis. We refer to Berglund and Bouchet&#10;and Reygner for an historical overview and further references.&#10;&#10;Recentlty, Bouchet and Reygner extended the Eyring-Kramers formula to&#10;the non-reversible setting. They showed that in this context the&#10;negative eigenvalue has to be replaced by the unique negative eigenvalue&#10;of .&#10;&#10;We present below a rigorous proof of this result, based on the&#10;variational formulae obtained for the capacity in the first part of the&#10;article, and on the approach developed by Bovier, Eckhoff, Gayrard, and&#10;Klein in the reversible case. This estimate permits to describe the&#10;metastable behavior of the diffusion in the small noise limit. Analogous&#10;results have been derived for random walks in a potential field in .">

These sets are represented in Figure&#10;\[fig2\].&#10;&#10;[**Approximations of the equilibrium potentials.**]{} We introduce in&#10;this subsection an approximation of the equilibrium potentials , . As&#10;pointed out in for reversible diffusions and in for non-reversible&#10;Markov chains, the crucial point consists in defining these&#10;approximations in a mesoscopic neighborhood of the saddle point, denoted&#10;above by .&#10;&#10;Let be the unique negative eigenvalue of the matrices , , and let , be&#10;the associated normal eigenvectors. By Lemma \[bl1\] below, the first&#10;component of , denoted by , does not vanish. Assume, without loss of&#10;generality, that .

However, does&#10;not belong to the set , being discontinuous along the -dimensional&#10;surface . To overcome this difficulty, we convolve with a smooth&#10;mollifier , where is supported on the -dimensional unit ball.&#10;&#10;Denote by the convolution of a function with the mollifier : . It&#10;follows from the explicit expression of and that and belongs to the set&#10;for sufficiently small .&#10;&#10;We turn to the test vector field . Note that this flow is discontinuous&#10;along . As we need a smooth flow to apply the Dirichlet principle, one&#10;might be tempted to continuously extend this test field all the way to&#10;the valleys and along a suitable tube connecting these valleys and&#10;passing through the saddle point. This is indeed the scheme carried out&#10;for the test function in the reversible case considered in . The&#10;corresponding extension procedure for the test flow is not as simple,&#10;mainly because constructing a smooth divergence-free field which matches&#10;the boundary condition is very difficult.&#10;&#10;We stress that in the discrete case , this difficulty is confronted&#10;directly and is solved by a delicate computation. We do not know yet how&#10;to carry out a similar procedure in the continuous context. Instead of&#10;applying Proposition \[prop1\], we insert a discontinuous vector field&#10;in the proof of this proposition and we estimate the error terms coming&#10;from the lack of regularity of the vector field. In particular, the&#10;proof below shows that the regularity conditions imposed on the vector&#10;fields in the variational formulae for the capacity can be overpassed.&#10;&#10;We start with the upper bound. Let and let Although does not satisfy the&#10;hypotheses of Proposition \[prop1\], inserting in the proof of&#10;Proposition \[prop1\] provides an upper bound for the capacity.&#10;&#10;By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Since, for sufficiently small ,&#10;belongs to , by the proof of Proposition \[prop1\], Therefore, by Lemma&#10;\[tp2\],&#10;&#10;On the other hand, by and by the triangle inequality, Since by the last&#10;two displayed equations and by Lemma \[tp0\],&#10;&#10;By , , , and since , so that, This is the upper bound for the capacity.&#10;&#10;In order to obtain the lower bound, we repeat the proof of Proposition&#10;\[prop2\]. Let By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Since for sufficiently&#10;small , as in the proof of Proposition \[prop2\], we obtain that On the&#10;other hand, by Lemma \[tp2\], In particular, the left-hand side of is&#10;equal to .&#10;&#10;Consider the first term on the right-hand side of . By and by the&#10;triangle inequality, Since by Lemma \[tp0\], the right-hand side of is&#10;less than or equal to Putting together the previous estimates, since ,&#10;we obtain from that This completes the proof of lower bound.&#10;&#10;We conclude this section with three lemmata, whose proofs are postponed&#10;to Section \[sec6\].&#10;&#10;\[tp0\] We have that&#10;&#10;Recall from that , where is an arbitrary positive number.&#10;&#10;\[tp1\] Assume that , in the sense that .
