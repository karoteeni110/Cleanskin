<outline text="Consistency of the Extracted Graph" _note="To compare the stability across different algorithms for CSCN, we use an&#10;analysis based on Wassermann et al. : we randomly take subsets of&#10;subjects each and computed the core graphs for all subsets. We then&#10;compute the number of UNSTABLE CONNECTIONS: connections that present in&#10;at least one core graph but not in all of them. Finally, in&#10;Table \[table:number\_of\_features\] we report each algorithm’s&#10;STABILITY:&#10;&#10;This measure quantifies the CSCN consistency across subsamples. Due to&#10;the homogeneity of our sample, we expect the CSCNs obtained by an&#10;algorithm to be similar across subsamples. Hence, a stabler algorithm is&#10;preferable.">

<outline text="Predicting Handedness-Specific Connectivity" _note="We evaluate performance of the methods by using the generated core&#10;graphs as a feature selection for handedness specific connectivity. We&#10;use a nested Leave--Out procedure: the outer loop performs model&#10;selection on of the subjects using the core graph algorithm and the&#10;inner loop performs model fitting and prediction using the selected&#10;features.&#10;&#10;Specifically, we first take subjects randomly and compute the core graph&#10;for those subjects using the three different algorithms. Then we add the&#10;weights for the selected edges for each subject, and select the features&#10;that are more determinant of handedness using a linear least-squares&#10;regression and the Bonferroni correction for multiple hypotheses. This&#10;experiment is repeated 500 times. We quantify the amount of features&#10;that are selected after each procedure, which indicates how useful is&#10;the core graph algorithm for selecting the edges related to handedness.&#10;We show the results in Table \[table:number\_of\_features\].&#10;&#10;To evaluate the prediction, we randomly take of the remaining subjects&#10;and fit a linear model on the features to predict connectivity weights&#10;using the handedness of each subject. Finally, we predict the values of&#10;the features from the handedness in the subjects left out. We quantify&#10;the quality of the linear model fitting Akaike Information Criterion&#10;(AIC) and of the prediction performance with the mean squared error&#10;(MSE) of the prediction. For both measures a lower value indicates&#10;better performance. The outer loop is performed 500 times and the inner&#10;loop 100 times per outer loop, which totals 50,000 experiments. We show&#10;the results of this experiments in Fig. \[fig:prediction\_performance\].">
