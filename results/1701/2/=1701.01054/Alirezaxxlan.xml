<outline text="Introduction" _note="Fractional calculus became an important tool which was applied&#10;successfully in many branches of science and engineering etc . The&#10;models based on fractional derivatives are crucial for describing the&#10;processes with memory effect . Local fractional has been defined on the&#10;real-line . As it is well known the integer, fractional and complex&#10;order derivatives and integrals are defined on the real-line. Analysis&#10;on the fractal has been studied by many researchers . The fractals&#10;curves and the functions on fractal space are not differentiable in the&#10;sense of standard calculus. As a result, by this motivation recently in&#10;the seminal paper the -calculus is suggested as a framework on the&#10;fractal sets and fractal curves . The -calculus is generalized and&#10;applied in physics as a new and useful tool for modelling processes on&#10;the fractals. Newtonian mechanics and Schrdinger equation on the fractal&#10;sets and curves are given . The gauge integral is utilized to&#10;generalized the -calculus for the unbound and singular function . The&#10;fractal grating is modeled by -calculus and corresponding diffraction is&#10;presented . One of the important aspects of fractional calculus was&#10;transferred recently to the fractal derivatives. Namely, the concept of&#10;non-local fractal derivatives was introduced in . In this manuscript our&#10;main aim is to define the fractal non-local derivatives and study their&#10;properties.\&#10;The plane of this work is as follows:\&#10;In Section \[2-sec\] we summarize the basic definitions and properties&#10;of the the local fractional derivatives. In Section \[3-sec\] the&#10;scaling properties of local and non-local derivatives are derived. More,&#10;in Section \[4-sec\] we develop the theory of fractal local and&#10;non-local Laplace transformations. In Section \[5-sec\] the comparison&#10;of local and non-local linear fractal differential equations are&#10;presented. In Section \[6-sec\] we indicate some illustrative&#10;applications. Section \[7-sec\] contains our conclusion.">

<outline text="Application of non-local fractal differential equations [6-sec]" _note="In this section we give the applications and new models are given to the&#10;non-local fractal derivatives .\&#10;**Fractal Abel’s tautochrone:** As a first example we generalized Abel’s&#10;problem which is the curve of quick descent on the fractal time-space.&#10;Using the conservation of energy in the fractal space the differential&#10;equation of the motion a particle is where is fractal arc length, and&#10;fractal space gravitational constant, and is the high particle from the&#10;reference of potential. As a result we have Let us consider so that we&#10;have Utilizing we arrive at It follows The solution of Eq.(\[bvlkcx\])&#10;is called the fractal cycloid.\&#10;**Fractal models for the viscoelasticity:** We generalize the&#10;viscoelasticity models to the fractal mediums in the case of ideal&#10;solids and ideal liquids. Namely, the fractal ideal solids describe by&#10;which is called Hooke’s Law of fractal elasticity. Where is fractal&#10;stress, is fractal strain which occurs under the applied stress and is&#10;the elastic modulus of the fractal material.\&#10;The fractal ideal fluid can model and describe by Newton’s Law of&#10;fractal viscosity as follows where is the viscosity of the fractal&#10;material. But in the nature we have real martials which have properties&#10;between the ideal solids and ideal liquids. It is clear that in the&#10;Hooke’s Law of fractal elasticity Eq. (\[xc987f\]) fractal stress is&#10;proportional to the -order derivative of the fractal strain and in the&#10;Newton’s Law of fractal viscosity the stress is proportional to the&#10;-order derivative of the fractal strain.

Hence if we choose it shows the processes&#10;with memory on the fractals.\&#10;If we choose where is characteristic function of the triadic Cantor set.&#10;In Figure \[751zswaq67b\] we plot the .&#10;&#10;Utilizing Eq.
