    <title>Groupwise Structural Parcellation of the Cortex: A Sound Approach Based
on Logistic Models</title>
    <abstract>Current theories hold that brain function is highly related to
long-range physical connections through axonal bundles, namely EXTRINSIC
CONNECTIVITY. However, obtaining a groupwise cortical parcellation based
on extrinsic connectivity remains challenging. Current parcellation
methods are computationally expensive; need tuning of several parameters
or rely on ad-hoc constraints. Furthermore, none of these methods
present a model for the cortical extrinsic connectivity of the cortex.
To tackle these problems, we propose a parsimonious model for the
extrinsic connectivity and an efficient parceling technique based on
clustering of tractograms. Our technique allows the creation of single
subject and groupwise parcellations of the whole cortex. The
parcellations obtained with our technique are in agreement with
structural and functional parcellations in the literature. In
particular, the motor and sensory cortex are subdivided in agreement
with the human homunculus of Penfield. We illustrate this by comparing
our resulting parcels with the motor strip mapping included in the Human
Connectome Project data. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The human brain is arranged in areas based on criteria such as&#10;cytoarchitecture, functional specialization or axonal connectivity .&#10;Parceling the cortex into such areas and characterizing their&#10;interaction is key to understanding how the brain works. Nowadays it’s&#10;accepted that axonal connectivity plays a fundamental role in the&#10;interaction between brain regions . Moreover, current theories hold that&#10;long-range physical connections trough axonal bundles, namely EXTRINSIC&#10;CONNECTIVITY, are strongly related to brain function, for example, this&#10;has been shown in macaques . Therefore, understanding how the cortex is&#10;arranged based on its extrinsic connectivity can provide key information&#10;in unraveling the internal organization of the brain.&#10;&#10;Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables the in vivo exploration of extrinsic&#10;connectivity and other aspects of white matter anatomy on the brain.&#10;However, in using diffusion MRI to infer long-distance connectivity,&#10;several challenges arise. A primary issue is the spatial resolution of&#10;diffusion imaging: it is several orders of magnitude coarser than axonal&#10;diameters (millimeters vs. micrometers) , making hard to infer some&#10;brain pathways. In addition, there is as yet no quantitative measure of&#10;the strength of connections from diffusion . Given these general&#10;limitations, obtaining a cortical parcellation based on extrinsic&#10;connectivity remains challenging . Moreover, most current parceling&#10;techniques compute either single-subject or groupwise parcellations.&#10;Single-subject techniques work by refining other parcellations , which&#10;introduces a bias in the resulting parcellation; parceling only part of&#10;the cortex  or using ad-hoc metrics to compare extrinsic connectivity .&#10;Meanwhile, existing groupwise methods rely on average connectivity&#10;profiles , which prevents obtaining single subject parcellations; seek a&#10;matching across subjects after independent parcellations , relying on&#10;possible noisy results, or need fine tuning of parameters, as the&#10;expected number of clusters to find .&#10;&#10;In this work, we present a parsimonious model for the cortical&#10;connectivity alongside an efficient parceling technique based on it. We&#10;summarize both contributions in Fig. \[fig:summary\]. Our model assumes&#10;that the cortex is divided in patches of homogeneous extrinsic&#10;connectivity. That is, nearby neurons in the cortex share approximately&#10;the same long-range physical connections, we call this the LOCAL&#10;COHERENCE CRITERION. Our assumption is based on histological results in&#10;the macaque brain . Inspired by statistical models for clustered data ,&#10;our model accounts for the variability in the axonal connections of&#10;neurons within a patch and for variability in patch boundaries across&#10;subjects. Our parceling technique allows us to create single subject and&#10;groupwise parcellations of the whole cortex in agreement with extant&#10;parcellations.&#10;&#10;We validate our technique by taking advantage of data available from the&#10;Human Connectome Project (HCP). Using our technique, we compute single&#10;subject and a groupwise parcellations. In this work we will focus on the&#10;groupwise case. For results of our method on the single-subject case&#10;please refer to . Here, we first assess the consistency of our groupwise&#10;parceling technique by comparing the groupwise parcellations of three&#10;disjoint groups of 46 subjects from the HCP. We also show that our&#10;technique computes a similar parcellation to the one obtained by when&#10;parceling only the frontal cortex. Later, to test the functional&#10;specialization of our frontal lobe parcels, we use a data-base of&#10;meta-analysis of fMRI studies , as in . After, we show that our&#10;groupwise parcels subdivide some well-known anatomical structures by&#10;comparing our results against Desikan’s atlas . Also, we show the&#10;functional specialization of some of our parcels by comparing against&#10;results from . Finally, we compare our groupwise parcellation of 138&#10;subjects against the multi-modal parcellation of . We show that, while&#10;the parcellations boundaries differ, our parcels show similar or better&#10;functional specialization, specially for motor related tasks.&#10;&#10;This work is organized as follows: In the Methods section we present our&#10;model for cortical connectivity and frame tractography within our model.&#10;Also, we present both our single-subject and groupwise case&#10;methodologies to parcellate the cortex. In the Experiments and Results&#10;section we present our results on HCP data. We then discuss our results&#10;and position ourselves with respect to the state of the art in the&#10;Discussion section. Finally, in the last section we provide our&#10;conclusions.">

  <outline text="Cortical Connectivity Model and Tractography" _note="Our model assumes that the cortex is divided in clusters of homogeneous&#10;extrinsic connectivity. That is, nearby neurons in the cortex share&#10;approximately the same long-ranged physical connections, we call this&#10;the LOCAL COHERENCE CRITERION. Our assumption is based on histological&#10;results in the macaque brain . As in clustered data models in&#10;statistics , we allow intra-cluster and across-subject variability in&#10;the connectivity. We formalize this concept as: where the set of points&#10;on the cortex is the disjoint union of each cluster and is the extrinsic&#10;connectivity fingerprint of a cluster. We will make the notion of&#10;variability explicit in eq. \[eq:tractogram\_rv\]. In this work, the&#10;connectivity fingerprint of a seed-point in the brain is a binary vector&#10;denoting to which other seed-points it is connected through axonal&#10;bundles. That is, the physical connections of a point in the brain are&#10;represented by its connectivity fingerprint .&#10;&#10;Currently, the most common tool for estimating the extrinsic&#10;connectivity fingerprint of a point in vivo is probabilistic&#10;tractography . Given a seed-point in the brain, probabilistic&#10;tractography creates a TRACTOGRAM: an image where each voxel is valued&#10;with its probability of being connected to the seed through axonal&#10;bundles. One way of calculating these probabilities is with a Monte&#10;Carlo procedure, simulating the random walk of water particles through&#10;the white matter . Each one of these paths is known as a streamline. If&#10;we model these streamlines as Bernoulli trials, where we get a value for&#10;the connection from our seed with other points (1 if they connected by&#10;the streamline, 0 if not) , then, we can model the tractogram of the&#10;subject in the seed-point as: where is a Bernoulli random variable[^1]&#10;representing “the point of the subject is connected to the voxel &quot;. Each&#10;Bernoulli’s parameter () represents the probability of being connected,&#10;and is estimated as the proportion of success in the Bernoulli trials of&#10;each seed.&#10;&#10;To formulate the tractogram in accordance to our hypothesis of cortical&#10;connectivity, we model it as a vector of random variables. In our model,&#10;each element in a tractogram comes from a random variable depending on&#10;the point’s cluster along with its intra-cluster and across-subject&#10;variability: in this case, the point belongs to the cluster ; represents&#10;the intra-cluster variability and represents the across-subject&#10;variability for the connectivity to voxel in the cluster .&#10;&#10;Since each follows a Bernoulli distribution (Eq. \[eq:tractogram\]) it’s&#10;difficult to find an explicit formulation for accounting for the&#10;variabilities. For this, we use the generalized linear model (GLM)&#10;theory. In this theory, the data is assumed to follow a linear form&#10;after being transformed with an appropriate link function . Using the&#10;following notation abuse: we derive from GLM a logistic random-effects&#10;model  for each point : where and represent the intra-cluster and&#10;across-subject variability respectively. According to GLM theory is the&#10;extrinsic connectivity fingerprint of cluster transformed:&#10;&#10;The choice of logit as link function is based on the work of . In their&#10;work, show that logit function’s codomain is a Euclidean space, which&#10;allows us to transform and manipulate the tractograms in a well-known&#10;space.&#10;&#10;[^1]: For the sake of clarity we denote all random variables with a&#10;    tilde, e.g. .">

  <outline text="Single Subject and Groupwise parceling Methodologies" _note="In the previous section, we hypothesized that the cortex is divided in&#10;clusters with homogeneous extrinsic connectivity, alongside&#10;intra-cluster and across-subject variability. In using the previous&#10;hypothesis, it is important to remark that we don’t have a priori&#10;knowledge of the cluster’s location or their variability. But, thanks to&#10;the proposed logistic random effects model, we formulated the problem of&#10;finding these clusters as a well-known clustering problem. This is&#10;because, after transforming the tractograms with the logit function as&#10;in eq. \[eq:not\_abuse\] they will be in a Euclidean space . Even more,&#10;eq. \[eq:ran\_eff\_model\] states that the transformed tractograms come&#10;from a mixture of Gaussian distributions, e.g. it is a Gaussian mixture&#10;model.&#10;&#10;To solve the Gaussian mixture model and find the clusters, we use a&#10;modified Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm. This was&#10;inspired by the method of . To enforce the local coherence criterion we&#10;also modify the algorithm to accept one parameter: the minimum size of&#10;the resulting clusters. Clusters smaller than this size are merged with&#10;neighbors, i.e. physically close clusters in the cortex. As we are&#10;working in a Euclidean space, we use Ward’s Hierarchical Clustering&#10;method . This method creates clusters with minimum within-cluster&#10;variance. The method’s result is a dendrogram: a structure that&#10;comprises different levels of granularity for the same parcellation.&#10;This allows us to explore different parcellation granularities by&#10;choosing cutting criteria, without the need of recomputing each time.&#10;&#10;The main advantage of the model we proposed in this work is that it&#10;allows us to create a groupwise parcellation using linear operations.&#10;Assuming direct seed correspondence across subjects, as in the HCP data&#10;set, our model lets us remove the subject variability of each seed’s&#10;tractogram by calculating the expected value across subjects: where the&#10;last equality is due to (Eq. \[eq:ran\_eff\_model\]). Since in our model&#10;the variabilities are normally distributed (Eq. \[eq:ran\_eff\_model\]),&#10;we can estimate the expected value across subjects by averaging a seed’s&#10;tractograms across subjects. This allows us to create&#10;population-representative tractograms for each seed free of&#10;across-subject variability, which then can be clustered to create a&#10;groupwise parcellation.">

    <outline text="Probabilistic Tractography" _note="To create the tractograms of each subject, we performed Constrained&#10;Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) based tractography  from a dense set of&#10;points in the cortex.

Vertices corresponding to the&#10;medial wall were excluded. To avoid superficial cortico-cortical&#10;fibers , we shrank each of the 138 surfaces into the white matter. For&#10;each subject, we fitted a CSD model  to their diffusion data using Dipy&#10;(version 0.11)  and created 5000 streamlines per seed-voxel using the&#10;implementation of probabilistic tractography in Dipy.

  <outline text="Parceling Subjects From the Human Connectome Project" _note="After performing tractography, we applied our parceling technique over&#10;each subject in our HCP sample. Specifically, we first transformed each&#10;tractogram with the logit function as in eq. \[eq:not\_abuse\]. Then, we&#10;clustered the tractograms of each subject using the modified AHC&#10;algorithm while imposing a minimum cluster size of in the finest&#10;granularity. Two examples of obtained single-subject parcellations at a&#10;granularity of 55 parcels are shown in fig. \[fig:single\_and\_group\].&#10;To create the groupwise parcellation, we took advantage of the vertex&#10;correspondence across subjects in the HCP data set . After transforming&#10;the tractograms with the logit transform, we computed the average&#10;connectivity of each seed by averaging its tractograms across-subject.&#10;Then, we computed the groupwise parcellation by clustering the averaged&#10;tractograms with our proposed technique (sec.&#10;\[sec:parceling\_methodologies\]). The obtained groupwise parcellation&#10;at a granularity of 55 parcels is shown in fig.&#10;\[fig:single\_and\_group\].&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Groupwise Parcellation Technique Consistency" _note="To study the consistency of our technique, we randomly divided our HCP&#10;subject sample in 3 disjoint groups, trying to maintain the same&#10;proportion of males and females on each. The resulting groups had: 24&#10;females, 22 males (group A); 23 females, 23 males (group B) and 28&#10;females, 18 males (group C). For each group we computed their groupwise&#10;parcellation. The resulting parcellations at two different levels of&#10;granularity are shown in fig. \[fig:groups\].&#10;&#10;To study the similarity between the obtained groupwise parcellations, we&#10;compared them at different levels of granularity using the adjusted Rand&#10;index . To have a baseline for the comparisons, we generated random&#10;parcellations of the cortex and computed the similarity between them. We&#10;computed two types of random parcellations: The first one is an&#10;homogeneous random parcellation with parcels, inspired in a method used&#10;by . To compute it, we start by choosing starting points in the cortex,&#10;then, we randomly expand each parcel on the cortex. By comparing these&#10;random parcellations between them we compute the minimum obtainable Rand&#10;index by mere chance at each level of granularity. In the second type of&#10;random parcellation, we simulate the behavior of our technique. For&#10;this, we create a parcellation with parcels and then, we iteratively&#10;merge two parcels chosen at random until all the parcels are merged in&#10;one. By comparing these random parcellations between them we obtain the&#10;minimum obtainable Rand index by a random Hierarchical Clustering&#10;Algorithm. Examples of these random parcellations can be seen in Fig&#10;\[fig:fake\_parcels\]. The baselines presented in fig.&#10;\[fig:real\_vs\_fake\] (yellow and violet lines) were computed by&#10;comparing of these random parcels at different levels of granularity.&#10;&#10;The result of comparing the groupwise parcellations of each group appear&#10;in fig. \[fig:real\_vs\_fake\]. The figure shows that the similarity&#10;between our groupwise parcellations (lines red, green and blue) are&#10;significantly higher than the baselines (violet and yellow). That is,&#10;the similarity between our parcellations differs (for most cases) more&#10;than 3 standard deviations from the baselines’ mean. Moreover, the&#10;similarity between our results differs more than 4 standard deviations&#10;from the comparison between synthetic hierarchical parcels. This results&#10;show that our groupwise parceling technique creates consistent&#10;parcellations.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Relationship with a frontal lobe parcellation" _note="Here we assess the agreement of our technique with an state-of-the-art&#10;extrinsic connectivity parceling technique. We do so by using our&#10;technique to parcellate the frontal lobe and compare our result against&#10;that of . In their work, use a principal component analysis (PCA)&#10;statistical framework to parcellate the frontal lobe. They obtain a&#10;parcellation with 12 parcels. Then, they show that each one of these&#10;parcels possess a functional specialization by using the Decode tool[^1]&#10;from Neurosynth . Thiebaut’s parcellation is currently available in&#10;Neurovault as an annotated volume[^2], registered on the Colin27&#10;template . We downloaded this parcellation and projected its parcels&#10;into a dense mesh representing the cortex of the Colin27 template. The&#10;dense mesh had the same amount of vertices as our chosen HCP subjects,&#10;and such vertices were coregistered with the HCP subjects’ cortical&#10;surfaces ones.&#10;&#10;From the Desikan Atlas of each of our HCP subjects, we derived a&#10;groupwise mask for the frontal lobe. Then, we computed a groupwise&#10;parcellation with our technique, using only the tractograms in the mask.&#10;Figure \[fig:frontal\] shows both the parcellation downloaded from&#10;Neurovault and our groupwise parcellation projected in the Colin&#10;template cortical surface. The figure shows our parcellation with 10&#10;parcels since this level of granularity showed the best Rand index&#10;against the Thiebaut’s parcellation. The colors of each parcel in our&#10;groupwise parcellation were picked in base to the position and amount of&#10;overlapping with the Thiebaut’s parcels on the surface. While the&#10;similarity according to the Rand index is not significantly high (),&#10;some visual similarity can be observed on the obtained parcellation,&#10;particularly in the blue, yellow, orange and green parcels. Moreover, as&#10;shown in table 1, our parcels show the same or even a higher level of&#10;functional specialization when processed with Neurosynth.&#10;&#10;To study the consistency of our result we computed the frontal lobe&#10;groupwise parcellation in each of the 3 disjoint groups from the&#10;previous experiment.

  <outline text="Anatomical Relationship and Functional Specialization of Our Parcels" _note="Here we present a proof of concept that our technique creates parcels&#10;within anatomical boundaries and with functional meaning. To do so,&#10;first, we extracted a parcellation with 55 parcels from the groupwise&#10;parcellation computed from the 138 subjects. This was made to get a&#10;parcellation with coarse granularity while having at least the amount of&#10;parcels in the anatomical atlas of Desikan  (36 parcels).

  <outline text="Relationship With a Multi-Modal Parcellation of the Cortex" _note="Finally, we study the (dis)similarities between our groupwise&#10;parcellation and that of . In their work, compute a parcellation of the&#10;whole cortex using information from different MRI modalities. In&#10;particular, they use information from task functional MRI; resting state&#10;functional MRI; myelin maps computed from T1 and T2 images and cortical&#10;thickness. It is important to remark that dMRI data, in which our work&#10;is solely based, was not used to construct their parcellation.&#10;&#10;To compare our results against Glasser’s atlas, we first extracted a&#10;parcellation of 180 parcels from the groupwise dendrogram of our 138 HCP&#10;subjects.

<outline text="Discussion" _note="In this work we presented a parsimonious statistical model for&#10;long-ranged axonal connectivity. Our model (section&#10;\[sec:cortical\_model\]), assumes that the cortex is divided in patches&#10;of homogeneous extrinsic connectivity, as histological results showed in&#10;the macaque brain . By borrowing ideas from statistical clustered data&#10;models , our model accounts for the variability in the axonal&#10;connections of a patch’s neurons and for variability in patch boundaries&#10;across subjects.&#10;&#10;Taking advantage of our proposed model, in Section&#10;\[sec:parceling\_methodologies\] we presented an efficient technique to&#10;parcellate the cortex based on its extrinsic connectivity. Our technique&#10;uses only dMRI information, without the need of relying on initial&#10;parcellations . Also, our technique allows parcellation of the whole&#10;cortex, overcoming the problem of working with only part of it .&#10;Additionally, our technique allows creation of both single subject and&#10;groupwise parcellations independently, avoiding the need to impose&#10;constraints between them .&#10;&#10;Inspired by , our technique uses Hierarchical Clustering to comprise&#10;multiple granularities of the same parcellation in a dendrogram. The&#10;fundamental difference is how we compare and merge tractograms during&#10;the clustering process. use Centroid Clustering  with the cosine&#10;distance. This can lead to an erroneous parcellation since the centroid&#10;criterion doesn’t minimize the cosine distance between points. Also,&#10;this method makes dendrograms with inversions , which are then removed&#10;heuristically. In our case, using a Logistic Random Effect model (eq.&#10;\[eq:ran\_eff\_model\]) allowed us to transform the tractograms into a&#10;Eucliden space (sec. \[sec:parceling\_methodologies\]). Then, we use&#10;Ward’s Hierarchical method , which creates clusters with minimum&#10;intra-cluster variance. We can use this algorithm since its only&#10;hypothesis is that the features to cluster are in a Euclidean space. One&#10;advantage of using Ward’s method is that we can use the Lance and&#10;Williams formula to update the disimilarity between tractograms at each&#10;iteration. The formula gives us the disimilarity between the new&#10;centroid created at each step and the rest of the existing tractograms&#10;in constant time. As far as we know there’s no Lance and Williams&#10;formula when using the cosine distance with the centroid linkage. This&#10;allows us to lower the time complexity of our algorithm with respect to&#10;Moreno-Dominguez. Another advantage of using Ward’s clustering is that&#10;our resulting dendrograms do not have inversions, which means that we&#10;don’t need to post-process them. As in , we also create the dendrogram&#10;using only one comprehensive parameter: the minimum size of each&#10;cluster. This parameter imposes the local coherence criterion. Using&#10;Hierarchical Clustering allows us to overcome the need of other&#10;techniques  to specify an expected number of clusters, which imposes the&#10;need to recompute the whole pipeline each time a new parcellation is&#10;required, and, using our Logistic Random Effects Model, allows us to use&#10;a hierarchical clustering algorithm which minimizes the intra-cluster&#10;variance.">

As seen in Fig. \[fig:real\_vs\_fake\] whole-cortex&#10;parcellations obtained with our method are consistent across groups, and&#10;the Adjusted Rand Index is significantly higher, i.e. more than 3&#10;standard deviations, for all granularities when compared with the null&#10;case of randomly-generated parcellations.&#10;&#10;Our whole-cortex groupwise parcellation reaches a maximum consistency&#10;score when the cortex is divided in 6 regions, see&#10;Fig. \[fig:real\_vs\_fake\]. As seen in Fig. \[fig:groups\], these&#10;parcellations are consistent with specific anatomo/functional networks:&#10;the frontal lobe section anterior to the prefrontal cortex is shown in&#10;yellow; the sensorimotor area is shown in cyan, the cingulate area is&#10;shown in beige; the fronto-occipital connection in orange, and the&#10;temporo-parietal system in pink.">

  <outline text="Our Method Creates Parcels in Agreement With a Single-Lobe Parceling Technique Extant in the Literature." _note="We showed that our technique obtains results similar to another method&#10;extant in the literature. We did so by parceling only the frontal and&#10;showing the visual similarity between our resulting parcels and those&#10;obtained by . Moreover, the blue, pink and green parcels in fig.&#10;\[fig:frontal\] share not only similar boundaries and location, but also&#10;functional specialization (Table 1). In some cases our parcels possess&#10;even higher spatial-correlation with functional task according to&#10;Neurosynth’s Decode tool[^1]. We assessed the consistency of our&#10;obtained groupwise parcellation by computing the groupwise frontal lobe&#10;parcellation of three disjoints groups of 46 subjects and comparing them&#10;using the adjusted Rand index. The obtained value of shows that our&#10;parcellation of the frontal lobe is consistent across groups.&#10;&#10;[^1]: http://neurosynth.org/decode/">

  <outline text="Our Method Creates Several Parcels in Agreement with Brain Anatomy." _note="We showed that many of our parcels are in agreement with brain anatomy.&#10;In particular, we showed that in our groupwise parcellation, with 55&#10;parcels, the following anatomical structures appeared to be found:&#10;Cingulate; Insula; Lateral-Occipital; Fusiform; Superior Frontal;&#10;Lingual; Motor and Sensory cortex. Here we discuss why some of these&#10;parcels were found and how are their conectivity fingerprints. In the&#10;case of the Cingulate, its fingerprint, shown in fig.&#10;\[fig:conn\_fing\], is strongly related with the Cingulate Fascicle (CF)&#10;pathway. This is consistent with the fact that the seeds located in the&#10;Cingulate will end up into the CF after being pushed in the&#10;white-matter. In the case of the Insula, each subdivision showed a&#10;specific pattern of connectivity as shown in fig. \[fig:conn\_fing\].&#10;These parcels show a gradient of connections from the occipital lobe to&#10;the frontal lobe consistent with that of . In the Lateral-Occipital&#10;region, we see a specific pattern of local connectivity which cannot be&#10;attributed to gyral bias since the Lateral-Occipital covers many sulci&#10;and gyrus. In the case of the fusiform, it is almost completely&#10;contained in one of our parcellations, which goes from the Fusiform up&#10;to the Lateral-Occipital (fig. \[fig:anatomical\_zoom\]). This could add&#10;evidence to the hypothesis that the Fusiform plays a role in visual&#10;tasks . Finally, the Motor and Sensory cortex appear to be found. While&#10;the appearance of each gyri is most probably because of gyral bias , the&#10;parcels inside them show specific patterns of structural connectivity&#10;(fig. \[fig:conn\_fing\]), and, as seen in section 3.5.2, functional&#10;specialization.&#10;&#10;">

  <outline text="Our Results Show a Close Relationship Between Structural Connectivity and Brain Function." _note="We assessed the functional specialization of some of our parcels by&#10;showing how they overlap with responses to functional and cognitive&#10;tasks measured with fMRI. In particular, for all the studied tasks, the&#10;parcels contained a higher proportion of positive values than negative&#10;ones as expressed by the positive mean values reported in tables 2 and&#10;3. For some parcels there were not even negative values. Moreover,&#10;several of the histograms on figures \[fig:function\_motor\] and&#10;\[fig:function\_cognition\] show a high frequency of z-score values&#10;greater than 5, which indicate a significant correlation with functional&#10;activation. Therefore, our results show, for some tasks, the strong&#10;relationship between extrinsic connectivity and functional&#10;specialization in the human brain cortex.">

  <outline text="Our Parcels Are Not Similar to Those Obtained by Glasser et al. (2016) But Possess Better Functional Specialization for Motor Tasks." _note="Our parcels were not related to those of . This is shown by the obtained&#10;adjusted Rand index score between them (0.28). It’s important to remark&#10;that our parcels are purely based on extrinsic connectivity, meanwhile&#10;those of do not use dMRI information. Glasser’s parcels are mostly based&#10;on myelin and functional information. In particular, their subdivision&#10;of the sensori-motor cortex (green parcels in fig.&#10;\[fig:glasser\_and\_me\]) is mostly based in Myelin maps as shown in&#10;Figure 4.a of . Because of this, their parcels in the sensori-motor&#10;cortex contain a wide range of z-scores when compared with responses to&#10;functional stimuli as shown by histograms a; b and c in fig.&#10;\[fig:glasser\_functional\]. In contrast, our parcels in the&#10;sensori-motor cortex, for a coarser parcellation, show a good overlap&#10;with function and are in agreement with the motor strip mapping as&#10;discussed in the previous section. Also, for the case of story&#10;categorization; shape recognition and face recognition, our parcels show&#10;a similar distribution of z-scores (fig. \[fig:function\_motor\]) than&#10;those with the highest mean z-scores of (parcels d; e and f of fig.&#10;\[fig:glasser\_functional\]).">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="Understanding how the brain is structurally organized and its&#10;relationship with functionality is an open question in neuroscience.&#10;Recent advances in acquisition and modeling techniques on dMRI have&#10;facilitated to study axonal connectivity in the brain. However,&#10;parceling the whole cortex based on a structural criterion remained&#10;challenging. In this work we presented a connectivity model, framed&#10;tractography within our model and presented a parceling technique that&#10;allows parcellation of the whole brain in both single subject and&#10;groupwise cases. Our technique, along with the obtained groupwise&#10;parcellation, could have major implications both in cognitive&#10;neuroscience and in development-aging studies. At the same time, our&#10;technique could help to lower the gap between structural connectivity&#10;and brain function, since some of our pure structural parcels showed&#10;good overlapping with responses to functional tasks.&#10;&#10;Both our parceling tool and the obtained groupwise parcellation are or&#10;will be soon freely available in GitHub and Neurovault. These tools&#10;provide a sound basis for new studies on human cognition, brain&#10;development, aging and disease. These tools can create fine&#10;parcellations of cortical areas, improving our knowledge about cortical&#10;organization. Future comparison with functional connectivity could lead&#10;to finally unraveling the link between axonal connectivity and brain&#10;function.\&#10;[**Acknowledgments:** This work has received funding from the European&#10;Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research&#10;and innovation program (ERC Advanced Grant agreement No 694665 :&#10;CoBCoM).
