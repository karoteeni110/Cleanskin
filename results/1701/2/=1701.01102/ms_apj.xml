    <title>The Fastest Galaxy Evolution in an Unbiased Compact Group Sample with
WISE</title>
    <abstract>We study the mid-infrared (MIR) properties of galaxies in compact groups
and their environmental dependence using the WIDE-FIELD INFRARED SURVEY
EXPLORER (WISE) data. We use a volume-limited sample of 670 compact
groups and their 2175 member galaxies with and , drawn from , which were
identified using a friends-of-friends algorithm. Among the 2175
galaxies, 1541 galaxies are detected at WISE 12 with a signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 3. Among the 1541 galaxies, 433 AGN-host galaxies are
identified by using both optical and MIR classification scheme. Using
the remaining 1108 non-AGN galaxies, we find that the MIR colors of
compact group early-type galaxies are on average bluer than those of
cluster early-type galaxies. When compact groups have both early- and
late-type member galaxies, the MIR colors of the late-type members in
those compact groups are bluer than the MIR colors of cluster late-type
galaxies. As compact groups are located in denser regions, they tend to
have larger early-type galaxy fractions and bluer MIR color galaxies.
These trends are also seen for neighboring galaxies around compact
groups. However, compact group member galaxies always have larger
early-type galaxy fractions and bluer MIR colors than their neighboring
galaxies. Our findings suggest that the properties of compact group
galaxies depend on both internal and external environments of compact
groups, and that galaxy evolution is faster in compact groups than in
the central regions of clusters. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Compact groups of galaxies contain several galaxies within just a few&#10;tens of kilo-parsec scales. This makes compact groups have extremely&#10;high galaxy number densities (the median galaxy number density of log\[&#10;Mpc\]), ), higher than the galaxy number densities of cluster and group&#10;environments (the median galaxy number density of log\[ Mpc\]) for&#10;clusters and groups in the A2199 supercluster, ). The velocity&#10;dispersions of compact groups are much smaller than those of clusters .&#10;These two characteristics make compact groups an ideal environment for&#10;frequent interactions and mergers between galaxies .&#10;&#10;Numerical simulations suggested that galaxies in a compact group should&#10;merge into a single elliptical galaxy within a few Gyrs, causing the&#10;compact group to disappear . also reached a similar conclusion through&#10;their study of star cluster age-dating and neutral hydrogen content in&#10;the Hickson compact group 31; the compact group should merge into a&#10;single elliptical within 1 Gyr (see also ). suggested that the abundance&#10;of compact groups should decrease as the redshift decreases from to in&#10;the CDM universe. However, found that the abundance of compact groups&#10;changes little with redshifts at , using a spectroscopically complete&#10;sample of 332 compact groups. also suggested an alternative scenario&#10;that compact groups do not merge, which predicts a constant abundance of&#10;compact groups at . However, this alternative scenario is based on the&#10;assumption of a universe without dark matter.&#10;&#10; suggested that compact groups replenish themselves with new members&#10;from the surrounding environment, thereby extending their lifetimes to&#10;the current epoch. The finding of , constant abundance of compact group&#10;at , can be explained by this replenishment model. This replenishment&#10;model is supported by several observational findings that showed that&#10;many () compact groups are embedded in or associated with larger-scale&#10;structures . However, showed that only 27% of compact groups are&#10;embedded in surrounding structures.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, many existing compact group catalogs suffer from some&#10;observational biases, which make them difficult to use for testing&#10;compact group formation models and for studying the relation between&#10;compact groups and their surrounding environments. For example,&#10;constructed a large sample of compact groups, from the photometric data&#10;() of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6 , including 77,088&#10;compact group candidates and their 313,508 tentative member galaxies.&#10;Their sample is the largest one currently, but it is highly contaminated&#10;with interlopers because the sample is based only on photometric&#10;information using Hickson’s selection criteria . To reduce this&#10;contamination, compiled the redshifts from Fred Lawrence Whipple&#10;Observatory (FLWO)/FAST observations and from the SDSS DR12 for the&#10;photometric sample of compact group galaxies in , and constructed a&#10;catalog of 332 compact groups. This catalog is currently the largest one&#10;with complete spectroscopic redshifts. However, this sample is affected&#10;by an isolation criterion from Hickson’s selection criteria. The&#10;isolation criterion requires that no galaxies be present in a radius of&#10;up to three times the group radius. This criterion was adopted to avoid&#10;selecting very dense regions like cluster cores, but this could&#10;introduce a bias that misses nearby compact groups with apparently large&#10;sizes and embedded systems in dense environments .&#10;&#10;Recently, published a new catalog of 1588 compact groups and their 5178&#10;member galaxies at using SDSS DR12 spectroscopic data supplemented by&#10;additional redshifts from the literature and from FLWO/FAST&#10;observations. They applied a friends-of-friends algorithm to identify&#10;the compact groups without using the isolation criterion. As a result,&#10;their catalog successfully contains nearby () compact groups and&#10;embedded systems in dense regions. This is important in order to study&#10;the relation between compact groups and their surrounding environments&#10;without any sample bias.&#10;&#10;Previous observational studies suggested that galaxy evolution in&#10;compact groups is faster than in the field from the comparisons of Lick&#10;indices , the star formation quenching timescales , specific star&#10;formation rates (SFRs) distribution , and color distribution . and found&#10;that the stellar ages and the early-type galaxy fractions of compact&#10;group galaxies are similar to those of cluster galaxies, which suggests&#10;that compact group galaxies evolve as fast as cluster galaxies.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, and showed that compact group galaxies exhibit a&#10;bimodal distribution in the SPITZER IRAC ( ) color space with a&#10;statistically evident gap, so-called “canyon”, between star-forming&#10;galaxies with MIR red colors and quiescent galaxies with MIR blue&#10;colors. Recently, newly identified the canyon galaxies in the WISE&#10;color-color diagram. This gap may suggest the accelerated galaxy&#10;evolution in compact groups because the gap is not seen in comparison&#10;galaxy samples from field, from interacting pairs, and from the center&#10;of the Coma cluster . found that compact group galaxies in the gap&#10;mostly show enhanced warm H emission from the observations with the&#10;SPITZER Infrared Spectrograph, which could be caused by shock heating .&#10;This result implies that shock heating may be responsible for rapid&#10;evolution of galaxies in compact groups.&#10;&#10;However, these results are mainly based on the catalogs of compact&#10;groups selected using Hickson’s criteria, which can introduce a sample&#10;bias. We therefore revisit the issues on the comparison of compact&#10;groups galaxies with cluster and field galaxies using the unbiased&#10;sample of compact groups from . In this paper, we use the WIDE-FIELD&#10;INFRARED SURVEY EXPLORER mid-infrared (MIR) data to study the&#10;environmental effects on compact group galaxies and the relation between&#10;compact groups and their surrounding environments. The MIR data are&#10;useful indicators of mean stellar ages , especially for compact group&#10;galaxies that are mainly dominated by old stellar populations.&#10;Red-sequence galaxies with small amounts of young ( Gyr) and&#10;intermediate-age (1-10 Gyr) stellar populations can be distinguished&#10;from those without the populations in MIR color space . The sample we&#10;use in this paper contains 670 compact groups with 2175 member galaxies&#10;drawn from the catalog of . When we investigate the MIR properties of&#10;galaxies in Sections 3 and 4, we use 1541 member galaxies detected at&#10;with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 3. This sample is larger&#10;than those of previous MIR studies. For example, the samples of and&#10;several previous studies have less than 50 compact groups, the sample of&#10;has 99 compact groups and 348 member galaxies, and the sample of has 163&#10;compact groups and 567 member galaxies.&#10;&#10;Section \[data\] describes the compact group sample and comparison&#10;samples of cluster/field galaxies. In Section 3 we compare the&#10;properties of galaxies in compact groups with those in other&#10;environments, and investigate how environment affects the properties of&#10;galaxies in compact groups. In Section 4 we discuss the environmental&#10;effects on galaxy evolution in compact groups and the relation between&#10;compact groups and their surrounding environments. In Section 5 we&#10;summarize our results and present conclusions. Throughout, we adopt flat&#10;CDM cosmological parameters: km s Mpc, , and .">

The completeness of the spectroscopic data&#10;in SDSS is low for bright galaxies at because of saturation and&#10;cross-talk in the spectrograph, and for the galaxies in high-density&#10;regions (e.g., galaxy clusters) because of the fiber collision (see&#10;Figure 1 of ). Therefore, supplemented the catalog with redshifts from&#10;the literature (; see also ) and from FAST observations at FLWO . They&#10;applied the friends-of-friends algorithm with a projected linking length&#10;of kpc and a radial linking length of km s, and constructed a&#10;magnitude-limited () sample of 1588 compact groups with each consisting&#10;of three or more member galaxies at . This new catalog contains 18 times&#10;as many systems and reaches three times the depth of the catalog of ,&#10;which is also based on the friends-of-friends algorithm.&#10;&#10; also constructed two volume-limited subsamples: the V1 sample of&#10;galaxies with and and the V2 sample of galaxies with and (V2)[^1]. These&#10;volume-limited samples contain 670 and 297 compact groups that are&#10;independently identified through the friends-of-friends algorithm.&#10;Unlike systems in the magnitude-limited sample, the volume-limited&#10;samples have systems with a median stellar mass independent of redshift.&#10;Therefore, the volume-limited samples allow us to study the properties&#10;of compact groups without any sample bias that could be introduced in&#10;the magnitude-limited sample. Details for the catalogs and the compact&#10;group selection are described in Sections 2 and 3 of .&#10;&#10;In this study, we use the V1 sample of 670 compact groups and their 2175&#10;member galaxies with and . To study the MIR properties of these&#10;galaxies, we cross-correlate the galaxies with the objects in the&#10;ALLWISE source catalog[^2] using a matching tolerance of 3,&#10;corresponding to about half of the FWHM of the PSF at 3.4 . Among the&#10;2175 galaxies, 2067 (95%) are matched with ALLWISE sources. We use the&#10;profile-fitting magnitudes of the sources at four MIR bands (3.4 , 4.6 ,&#10;12 , and 22 ). When we investigate the MIR properties of galaxies, we&#10;use only galaxies detected at 12 with . Because the ALLWISE magnitudes&#10;with are just upper limits, we choose only the galaxies with to safely&#10;use the magnitudes. Among the 2175 galaxies, 1541 galaxies (71%) are&#10;detected at 12 . If we adopt the S/N cut of 5, the sample size is&#10;reduced from 1541 to 863 galaxies by 44%. However, we confirm that our&#10;conclusions do not change much even if we use this small sample.&#10;&#10;To compare the physical properties of compact group galaxies with those&#10;in other environments, we use two comparison samples of cluster and&#10;field galaxies. constructed a sample of 129 relaxed Abell clusters at&#10;using the spectroscopic sample of the SDSS DR7 . The cluster sample also&#10;includes the galaxies at ( is the virial radius of the cluster) and km s&#10;( and are radial velocity of a galaxy and systematic velocity of the&#10;cluster). From this sample, we selected 2433 galaxies at as the cluster&#10;galaxy sample, and 6312 galaxies at as the field galaxy sample. showed&#10;that the fraction of early-type galaxies decreases with increasing&#10;clustercentric radius at . However, the early-type galaxy fraction is&#10;nearly constant at (see their Figure 4), suggesting that the galaxies at&#10;can be considered to be field galaxies. The galaxies in the two&#10;comparison samples also satisfy the criterion of and as do those in the&#10;V1 sample.&#10;&#10;The optical parameters of galaxies that we consider in this study are&#10;-band Petrosian absolute magnitude (), color, and morphology.

The color was computed using&#10;extinction- and -corrected (to ) - and -band model magnitudes. Galaxy&#10;morphology data are mainly from the Korea Institute for Advanced Study&#10;(KIAS) DR7 value-added galaxy catalog . Galaxies in this catalog are&#10;morphologically classified into early (E/S0) and late types (S/Irr)&#10;based on an automated scheme with color, the color gradient, and the&#10;-band concentration index .

  <outline text="Galaxy Color Distributions" _note="Figure \[colorhist\] shows the and distributions of the 1541 compact&#10;group galaxies detected at 12 . The mean error is 0.07, while the mean&#10;error is 0.12. In this diagram, compact group galaxies are distributed&#10;from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner because galaxies&#10;with bluer optical colors tend to have redder MIR colors.&#10;&#10;In panels (b) and (c), we plot the and distributions of compact group&#10;galaxies. For comparison, we also plot the distributions of cluster and&#10;field galaxies. As shown in panel (b), histograms for the three galaxy&#10;samples peak at . However, the fraction of galaxies with in the compact&#10;group galaxy sample is , which is larger than that of the cluster galaxy&#10;sample () and of the field galaxy sample (). The mean is in the compact&#10;group galaxy sample, which is also larger than the of the cluster galaxy&#10;sample and the of the field galaxy sample[^1]. These suggest that&#10;compact group galaxies are dominated by optical red-sequence galaxies&#10;much like cluster galaxies, which is consistent with the findings of and&#10;.&#10;&#10;Optical red-sequence galaxies, located in a narrow range of , have MIR&#10;colors ranging from to . divided optical red-sequence galaxies into MIR&#10;blue galaxies (i.e., ) and MIR green galaxies (i.e., )[^2]. The MIR blue&#10;galaxies are composed of stellar populations older than 10 Gyr, while&#10;the MIR green galaxies have small (5%) mass fractions of relatively&#10;young ( Gyr) or intermediate ( Gyr) stellar populations . Optical colors&#10;trace star formation on timescales up to 1 Gyr . Therefore, the MIR&#10;green galaxies are not distinguishable from the MIR blue galaxies in&#10;optical colors because both lie in the optical red-sequence . Thus, we&#10;need to use MIR colors instead of optical colors to investigate whether&#10;galaxies in compact groups experienced different star formation&#10;histories from those in clusters, or not.&#10;&#10;In panel (c) of Figure \[colorhist\], we compare the MIR color&#10;distributions between the three different galaxy samples. The cluster&#10;galaxy sample shows a blue peak at and a red peak . The blue peak is&#10;higher than the red peak. The compact group galaxy sample shows a strong&#10;blue peak and a red bump, but the field galaxy sample shows a different&#10;color distribution with a blue bump and a strong red peak. The mean is&#10;for the compact group galaxy sample, for the cluster galaxy sample, and&#10;for the field galaxy sample. These results suggest that compared to&#10;cluster galaxies, compact group galaxies are more dominated by MIR blue&#10;galaxies: the fraction of MIR blue galaxies is in the compact group&#10;galaxy sample and in the cluster galaxy sample. This suggests that the&#10;mean stellar ages of compact group galaxies are on average older than&#10;those of cluster galaxies.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, because compact groups favor strong galaxy&#10;interactions, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) should be&#10;expected . Because the contribution of AGN to the MIR fluxes of the host&#10;galaxies is not negligible, we identify the AGN in our sample and remove&#10;them. First, we identify optically selected AGN using the scheme given&#10;by who classified star-forming galaxies from AGN (Seyferts and LINERs)&#10;and composite galaxies in the \[NII\]/H versus \[OII\]/H diagram (see&#10;their Figure 1). We remove 281 AGN and 149 composite galaxies from the&#10;sample of 1541 compact group galaxies. Second, we identify MIR selected&#10;AGN using the classification method introduced by who defined the AGN&#10;wedge in the WISE versus color-color diagram (see their Figure 2). We&#10;find 8 MIR selected AGN in the compact group galaxy sample. Among the 8&#10;MIR selected AGN, 5 are also optically selected AGN. In total, 433&#10;galaxies (28%) are classified as AGN-host galaxies among the 1541&#10;compact group galaxies.&#10;&#10;[ccrcrccc]{} V1CG001 &amp; 1237648705657307198 &amp; &amp; -9.9 &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG001 &amp; 1237648705657307347 &amp; &amp; 1.4 &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG001 &amp; 1237648705657307315 &amp; &amp; 0.2 &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG002 &amp; 1237661126155436166 &amp; &amp; 26.5 &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG002 &amp; 1237661126155436169 &amp; &amp; 44.9 &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG002 &amp; 1237661126155436164 &amp; &amp; 23.2 &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG003 &amp; 1237661136886431890 &amp; &amp; 9.3 &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG003 &amp; 1237661136886497282 &amp; &amp; 31.7 &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; \&#10;V1CG003 &amp; 1237661136886497353 &amp; &amp; 10.6 &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \[tab2\]&#10;&#10;We compare the MIR color distribution of all 1541 compact group galaxies&#10;with that of 1108 non-AGN compact group galaxies in Figure&#10;\[w13abhist\_agn\](a). The difference between the two distributions is&#10;remarkable at where the AGN fraction is larger than 30%. This color&#10;range is similar to the WISE infrared transition zone, , defined by&#10;[^3]. They showed that Seyferts and LINERs are representatives of the&#10;zone, which is consistent with our result.&#10;&#10;In Figure \[w13abhist\_agn\](b), we compare the MIR color distribution&#10;of non-AGN compact group galaxies with that of non-AGN cluster galaxies.&#10;In this comparison, we use 1137 non-AGN cluster galaxies () after&#10;removing 324 AGN-host galaxies (22%) from the 1461 cluster galaxy&#10;sample. To statistically examine the difference in the color&#10;distributions of the two samples, we compute -values from the&#10;Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test () and the Anderson-Darling (AD) k-sample&#10;test (). The and indicate the probability of rejecting the null&#10;hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same parent sample.&#10;The two tests on the two color distributions give the and of , rejecting&#10;the null hypothesis at a significance of level.&#10;&#10;In Figure \[w13abhist\_agn\](b), we use another comparison sample of 617&#10;cluster galaxies located at . In comparison with the cluster galaxy&#10;sample, the cluster galaxy sample displays the MIR color distribution&#10;more colsely to that of the compact group galaxy sample ( and ; the null&#10;hypothesis is rejected at the level). The fractions of MIR red (i.e., )&#10;galaxies in the compact group galaxy sample is . This is similar to the&#10;in the cluster galaxy sample, but smaller than the in the cluster galaxy&#10;sample. The mean for the compact group galaxy sample () is similar to&#10;the for the cluster galaxy sample, but smaller than the for the cluster&#10;galaxy sample. The early-type galaxy fraction in the cluster galaxy&#10;sample () is similar to that in the compact group galaxy sample (),&#10;while the fraction is in the cluster galaxy sample. These results&#10;suggest that compact groups are composed of galaxy populations similar&#10;to those in cluster central regions.&#10;&#10;However, we find that the fraction of MIR green (i.e., ) galaxies is&#10;smaller in the compact group galaxy sample () than in the cluster galaxy&#10;sample (). This may suggest that galaxy transition occurs faster in&#10;compact groups than in cluster environments. Hereafter, we use only the&#10;cluster galaxy sample in the comparison with the compact group galaxy&#10;sample.&#10;&#10;Figure \[w13abhist\_morph\_maglim\](a) shows again the MIR color&#10;distributions of the 1108 non-AGN compact group galaxies and of the 617&#10;non-AGN cluster galaxies. In Figure \[w13abhist\_morph\_maglim\] we&#10;divide these two galaxy samples into early-type and late-type galaxy&#10;samples. In Figure \[w13abhist\_morph\_maglim\](b) we compare the MIR&#10;color distribution of the 687 compact group early-type galaxies with&#10;that of the 407 cluster early-type galaxies. The and values of reject&#10;the null hypothesis for the two color distributions at a significance.&#10;We find that the fraction of MIR green galaxies is smaller in the&#10;compact group early-type galaxy sample () than in the cluster early-type&#10;galaxy sample (), and that the mean value is smaller in the compact&#10;group early-type galaxy sample () than in the cluster early-type galaxy&#10;sample ().&#10;&#10;In Figure \[w13abhist\_morph\_maglim\](c) we compare the color&#10;distribution of the 421 compact group late-type galaxy sample with that&#10;of the 210 cluster late-type galaxy sample. The difference in the color&#10;distribution for the two late-type galaxy samples is not highly&#10;significant (), compared to the case for early-type galaxy samples.&#10;However, the mean value is smaller in the compact group late-type galaxy&#10;sample () than in the cluster late-type galaxy sample (). The MIR green&#10;galaxy fraction is larger in the compact group late-type galaxy sample&#10;() than in the cluster late-type galaxy sample ().&#10;&#10;Because galaxy properties are dependent on their stellar masses (or&#10;luminosities), we compare the MIR color distributions of compact group&#10;galaxies and cluster galaxies by using a fixed . We use instead of&#10;stellar masses because the former is available for all galaxies in both&#10;compact group and cluster galaxy samples. We find that the null&#10;hypothesis is rejected in the comparison for early-type galaxies with at&#10;the level (panel h; and ). For the total galaxy sample with (panel g),&#10;rejects the null hypothesis at the level, but does not. The other cases&#10;show lower significance of rejection.

  <outline text="MIR Color-Luminosity Diagram" _note="In Figure \[mircld\_env\] we investigate the versus 12 luminosity&#10;distribution of galaxies in compact groups, clusters, and field. In the&#10;versus 12 luminosity diagram, galaxies are divided into three classes&#10;following the classification scheme of : MIR star-forming sequence&#10;galaxies (above the inclined dashed lines[^1]), MIR blue cloud galaxies&#10;(), and MIR green valley galaxies located between the two classes. In&#10;this section we use this classification scheme to calculate the&#10;fractions of different MIR classes. In particular, MIR green valley&#10;galaxies are not necessarily “MIR green&quot; in the sense of Section 3.1.&#10;&#10;In the three panels in the top row of Figure \[mircld\_env\], we plot&#10;1108 compact group galaxies, 617 cluster galaxies, and 3854 field&#10;galaxies, separately. All these galaxies are not AGN-host galaxies. We&#10;find that the fraction of MIR blue cloud galaxies is larger in the&#10;compact group galaxy sample () than in the cluster galaxy sample () and&#10;in the field galaxy sample (). In the cluster galaxy sample and the&#10;field galaxy sample, the fractions of MIR blue cloud galaxies are&#10;smaller than the fractions of MIR green valley galaxies. In contrast, in&#10;the compact group galaxy sample, the fraction of MIR blue cloud galaxies&#10;is larger than the fraction of MIR green valley galaxies ().&#10;&#10;When we consider only early-type galaxies, as shown in the middle row of&#10;Figure \[mircld\_env\], we obtain similar results. The fraction of&#10;early-type galaxies is 62.0% (687/1108) in the compact group galaxy&#10;sample, 66.0% (407/617) in the cluster galaxy sample, and 26.5%&#10;(1023/3854) in the field galaxy sample. Among the three early-type&#10;galaxy samples, the compact group early-type galaxy sample shows the&#10;highest MIR blue cloud galaxy fraction. In addition, in the cluster&#10;early-type galaxy sample and in the field early-type galaxy sample, the&#10;fractions of MIR blue cloud galaxies is smaller than those of MIR green&#10;valley galaxies. However, in the compact group early-type galaxy sample,&#10;the fraction of MIR blue cloud galaxies () is significantly larger than&#10;the fraction of MIR green valley galaxies (). These results suggest not&#10;only that early-type galaxies in compact groups are on average older&#10;than those in other environments, but also that the timescales for&#10;early-type galaxies to stay in the MIR green valley are shorter in&#10;compact groups than in other environments.&#10;&#10;In the bottom row of Figure \[mircld\_env\], we plot only late-type&#10;galaxies. The fraction of MIR star-forming sequence galaxies decreases&#10;from the field () to clusters () to compact groups (). Thus, the&#10;fractions of MIR blue cloud galaxies and of MIR green valley galaxies&#10;are smallest in the field ( and ) and largest in compact groups ( and ).&#10;The smallest fraction of MIR star-forming sequence galaxies in compact&#10;groups is consistent with the case that the star formation quenching for&#10;late-type galaxies occurs more effectively in compact groups than in&#10;clusters and in the field.

  <outline text="Fast Galaxy Evolution in Compact Groups" _note="In Section \[result\], we find that the MIR colors of early-type&#10;galaxies are bluer in compact groups than in clusters and the field.&#10;This trend also persists when we use several subsamples with , , and .&#10;We also find that the late-type galaxies in the (or km s) compact groups&#10;have MIR colors bluer than those of cluster late-type galaxies. These&#10;results imply that stellar populations in early-type galaxies are on&#10;average older in compact groups than in clusters, and that star&#10;formation activity of late-type galaxies is suppressed more efficiently&#10;in compact groups than in clusters. These results suggest that galaxy&#10;evolution in compact groups is faster than in the central () regions of&#10;clusters.&#10;&#10;So far, several studies have concluded that galaxy evolution is faster&#10;in compact groups than in the field through various analyses . and found&#10;that the properties of compact groups (i.e., stellar ages and the&#10;early-type galaxy fraction) are more similar to those of cluster&#10;galaxies than those of field galaxies. However, previous studies have&#10;not found evidence that galaxy evolution is faster in compact groups&#10;than in galaxy clusters.&#10;&#10; and showed that compact group galaxies show a strong bimodal SPITZER&#10;IRAC color distribution with an evident gap at green colors. This gap is&#10;not found in comparison samples of isolated galaxies, galaxy pairs, and&#10;the center of the Coma cluster. However, they found that the Coma infall&#10;region shows the color distribution statistically similar to that of&#10;compact group galaxies. They interpreted these results as that the&#10;infall region and compact groups have a similarity in environment. To&#10;examine their results with our data, we select 495 galaxies at&#10;(representing the central regions of clusters) and 231 galaxies at&#10;(representing the infall regions) from the cluster galaxy sample. We&#10;compare the MIR color distributions for the two cluster galaxy&#10;subsamples with that for the compact group galaxy sample in Figure&#10;\[comp\_w13abhist\_cluster\](a). The color distribution for the compact&#10;group galaxy sample is more similar to that for the cluster galaxy&#10;sample ( and ) than for the cluster galaxy sample ( and ). This result&#10;is not consistent with the results of Walker et al.&#10;&#10; used a sample of 16 Hickson compact groups. used not only 21 Hickson&#10;compact groups but also 16 Redshift Survey Compact Groups identified&#10;using the friends-of-friends algorithm. However, only 5 of the 16 RSCGs&#10;are embedded in larger structures such as clusters. Thus, Walker et&#10;al.’s samples could also be dominated by compact groups located in less&#10;dense regions. We select 571 galaxies in the compact groups to mimic the&#10;Walker et al.’s sample, and show their MIR color distribution in Figure&#10;\[comp\_w13abhist\_cluster\](b). The MIR color distribution of the 571&#10;galaxies in the compact groups is not statistically different with the&#10;color distribution for the cluster galaxy sample ( and ), which is&#10;consistent with the results of Walker et al. Therefore, the different&#10;results between this study and Walker et al. are probably from the use&#10;of different methods in identifying compact groups with and without&#10;using isolation criterion (see also Figure 10 of ).&#10;&#10;One of the reasons why galaxy evolution is faster in compact groups than&#10;in clusters is likely because galaxy interactions are more frequent in&#10;compact groups than in clusters. The median velocity dispersion for our&#10;compact groups is 200 km s, which is much smaller than the median value&#10;for galaxy clusters, 800 km s . Furthermore, the mean size of compact&#10;groups is 30.7 kpc, which is much smaller than the typical virial radius&#10;of galaxy clusters, 1 Mpc . These characteristics make the interactions&#10;have a more significant effect in compact groups than in clusters.&#10;&#10;In Figure \[w1abs\_env\], we compare the 3.4 absolute magnitude ()&#10;distribution of early- and late-type galaxies in compact groups,&#10;clusters, and the field. showed that can be used as a proxy for stellar&#10;masses () of galaxies. We confirm the correlation between the and using&#10;the compact group galaxies[^1]. The stellar masses in this study are&#10;based on , and are calculated using the LePHARE[^2] spectral energy&#10;distribution fitting code with the SDSS photometric data (see Section 2&#10;of for details).

  <outline text="Relation between Compact Group Members and Neighboring Galaxies" _note="In Section 3.3, as shown in Figure \[w13abhist\_nbg\], we find that&#10;compact groups have larger and bluer MIR colors as their surrounding&#10;environments are denser (larger ). To further investigate the effects of&#10;the surrounding environments on the physical properties of compact group&#10;member galaxies, we compare the properties of neighboring galaxies&#10;around each compact group with those of the compact group member&#10;galaxies. We calculate , mean (), and mean () for neighboring galaxies&#10;in the comoving cylinder of each compact group. Figure&#10;\[nbg\_bg\_properties\] shows , , and for neighboring galaxies as a&#10;function of . Triangles indicate the mean values of the three parameters&#10;in bins. As increases, neighboring galaxies have larger , redder optical&#10;colors, and bluer MIR colors. For comparison, we compute , , and for&#10;member galaxies of each compact group. Squares represent the mean values&#10;for the three parameters of compact group member galaxies.&#10;&#10;We find that the two mean curves show a similar pattern in all three&#10;panels. The -dependence of , , and for neighboring galaxies is&#10;consistent with the morphology-density or the SFR-density relation .&#10;However, it is interesting that the similar trends are also seen for&#10;compact group member galaxies. Since compact groups are very small in&#10;size (the mean size is kpc), their internal galaxy number densities are&#10;much higher than the surrounding densities. The mean internal density of&#10;compact groups, measured by the number of members divided by the sizes&#10;of the groups, is Mpc, which is much higher than the mean surrounding&#10;density, Mpc, from . Moreover, the internal galaxy number densities of&#10;compact groups do not depend on the surrounding galaxy number densities.&#10;Thus, the -dependence of the properties of compact group member galaxies&#10;can not be explained by the morphology-density or SFR-density relations&#10;alone.&#10;&#10;The similar -dependence for compact group member galaxies and their&#10;neighboring galaxies suggests that the properties of compact group&#10;galaxies are related to those of their neighboring galaxies. If the&#10;physical properties of compact group galaxies are independent of their&#10;neighboring galaxies, the two mean curves would show different&#10;behaviors. A plausible scenario would be that the neighboring galaxies&#10;are sources of member galaxies in compact groups. This supports the idea&#10;of that compact groups replenish their members from surrounding&#10;environments, so that they do not disappear by mergers within a few&#10;Gyrs. Previous studies have supported this replenishment model by&#10;showing that many () compact groups are associated with larger-scale&#10;galaxy structures that may supply new members of compact groups. On the&#10;other hand, our finding is more direct observational evidence that the&#10;replenishment occurs regardless of the surrounding density of compact&#10;groups.&#10;&#10;An important point is that compact groups are not simply aggregates of&#10;captured neighboring galaxies. Figure \[nbg\_bg\_properties\] shows that&#10;the two mean curves do not overlap, but differ systematically. This&#10;result suggests that there are additional environmental effects playing&#10;a critical role in morphology transformation and star formation&#10;quenching for compact group galaxies, which probably results from&#10;frequent interactions among member galaxies. This result also suggests&#10;that compact groups are the most suitable environment for the&#10;pre-processing .">

  <outline text="Hydrodynamic Interactions in Compact Groups" _note="We find that the MIR colors of late-type galaxies are bluer in the&#10;compact groups than in the compact groups (Figure \[w13\_efrac\_lgal\]).&#10;This dependence is still found when or is fixed (see Figures&#10;\[w13abhist\_vdisp\_efrac\] and \[w13abhist\_nbg\_efrac\_lgal\]),&#10;indicating that among the three environmental parameters, could be the&#10;most important parameter in determining the MIR colors of late-type&#10;member galaxies. The colors of late-type galaxies are well correlated&#10;with specific SFRs . Thus, this finding suggests that star formation&#10;activity of late-type galaxies is suppressed more efficiently in the&#10;compact groups than in the compact groups. Moreover, the suppression of&#10;star formation activity is stronger in the compact groups than in the&#10;cluster central () regions (Figure \[w13\_efrac\_lgal\]).&#10;&#10; showed that late-type galaxies in the compact groups tend to have&#10;smaller specific SFRs than those in the compact groups. Their result&#10;seems similar to our result. To verify their result with our sample, we&#10;divide our compact group sample into the , , and compact groups. The&#10;large values () of and cannot reject the null hypothesis for two MIR&#10;color distributions for late-type galaxies in the compact groups and for&#10;late-type galaxies in the compact groups. However, the and reject the&#10;null hypothesis for two MIR color distributions for late-type galaxies&#10;in the compact groups and for late-type galaxies in the compact groups&#10;at a significance .

The different criterion between this study and Bitsakis&#10;et al. probably results from different compact group samples.&#10;&#10;An important point here is that the star formation activity of late-type&#10;galaxies in compact groups is suppressed when the groups contain&#10;early-type members. This suppression of star formation activity cannot&#10;be explained by gravitational interactions among member galaxies alone.&#10;and found that galaxy properties strongly depend on the distance and&#10;morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy, using spectroscopic samples&#10;drawn from the SDSS data. They showed that when a galaxy is located&#10;within the virial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy, the galaxy&#10;tends to have a morphological type similar to that of the neighbor&#10;galaxy. However, this phenomenon does not manifest if the distance to&#10;the neighbor is greater than the virial radius of the neighbor. They&#10;suggested that the phenomenon is due to hydrodynamic interactions, and&#10;that the effects of hydrodynamic interactions are significant to change&#10;the morphology and star formation activity of galaxies when the galaxies&#10;are located within the virial radii of their neighbor galaxies. The&#10;sizes of compact groups (the mean value is 30.7 kpc) are significantly&#10;smaller than virial radii of member galaxies . This implies that compact&#10;group member galaxies are already located within the virial radius of&#10;each other, and that they interact hydrodynamically each other.&#10;&#10; focused on the case of galaxies located within the virial radii of&#10;massive galaxy clusters, and found that even in cluster environments the&#10;hydrodynamic interactions with early-type neighbor galaxies are the main&#10;drivers of star formation quenching of late-type galaxies. They also&#10;found that the effects of the cluster hot gas on the star formation&#10;quenching of galaxies at is insignificant compared to the effects of&#10;hydrodynamic interactions with neighbor galaxies. Unlike cluster&#10;environments, hot gas of compact groups is not in a hydrostatic&#10;equilibrium state, and it is likely to be associated with the individual&#10;galaxies or brightest galaxies , suggesting that hydrodynamic effects&#10;from hot gas are insignificant in compact groups. Therefore, we conclude&#10;that the suppressed star formation activity of late-type galaxies in the&#10;compact groups likely results from hydrodynamic interactions with&#10;early-type member galaxies.">

<outline text="Summary and Conclusions" _note="We study the MIR properties of galaxies in compact groups and their&#10;environmental dependence using a volume-limited sample of 670 compact&#10;groups and their 2175 member galaxies with and , drawn from the catalog&#10;of . This catalog was derived from nearly complete redshift survey data,&#10;and was constructed by applying a friends-of-friends method without&#10;applying Hickson’s isolation criterion, which make the catalog include&#10;nearby compact groups and embedded compact groups in high-density&#10;regions that were often excluded from previous catalogs. Using this&#10;unbiased compact group sample, we perform a study comparing the physical&#10;properties of galaxies in compact groups with those of galaxies in other&#10;environments such as galaxy clusters and the field. We use three&#10;environmental parameters including , , and to represent the internal and&#10;external environment of the compact groups. Our key findings of this&#10;study are summarized as follows.&#10;&#10;The MIR colors of compact group early-type galaxies are on average bluer&#10;than those of cluster () early-type galaxies regardless of , , and .&#10;This suggests that early-type galaxies in compact groups are on average&#10;older than those of cluster galaxies.&#10;&#10;The MIR colors of the late-type galaxies in the compact groups tend to&#10;be bluer than those of cluster late-type galaxies. These suggests that&#10;the star formation activity of late-type galaxies is suppressed more&#10;efficiently in compact groups than in clusters.&#10;&#10;As increases, compact groups have larger , redder optical colors, and&#10;bluer MIR colors. These trends are also seen for neighboring galaxies&#10;around compact groups. Considering the extremely high galaxy number&#10;densities in compact group environments, this similar -dependence for&#10;compact group member galaxies and their neighboring galaxies is not well&#10;explained by the morphology- and SFR-density relations. This result can&#10;be explained by the scenario that neighboring galaxies are sources of&#10;member galaxies in compact groups, supporting the replenishment model&#10;suggested by .&#10;&#10;At a given , compact group members always have on average larger and&#10;bluer MIR colors than neighboring galaxies. This suggests that compact&#10;groups are not simply aggregates of captured neighboring galaxies, and&#10;that compact group environments play a critical role in accelerating&#10;morphology transformation and star formation quenching for the member&#10;galaxies.&#10;&#10;In the compact groups, the MIR colors of late-type galaxies are on&#10;average redder than those of cluster late-type galaxies. However, in the&#10;compact groups, the MIR colors of late-type galaxies are on average&#10;bluer than those in cluster late-type galaxies. This indicates that star&#10;formation quenching occurs more effectively in compact groups than in&#10;clusters when compact groups have early-type members. This suppressed&#10;star formation activity of late-type galaxies likely results from&#10;hydrodynamic interactions with early-type member galaxies.&#10;&#10;Our results suggest that galaxy evolution is faster in compact groups&#10;than in other environments, and that compact groups are likely to be the&#10;best place for the pre-processing .&#10;&#10;We thank the anonymous referee for useful and constructive comments that&#10;helped us to improve the manuscript.
