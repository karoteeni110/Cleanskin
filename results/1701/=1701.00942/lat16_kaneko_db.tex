\section{Introduction}

%// D meson semileptonic decays and FFs

The $D \!\to\! \pi l \nu$ and $D \!\to\! K l \nu$ semileptonic decays provide
a precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements
$|V_{cd}|$ and $|V_{cs}|$, 
and play an important role in the search for new physics 
in the charm sector~\cite{NP}.
The vector and scalar form factors $\fpzDP$ 
describe non-perturbative QCD effects,
and are defined from the relevant hadronic matrix elements as 
\bea
   \langle P(p^\prime) | V_\mu | D(p) \rangle 
   & = & 
   (p+p^\prime)_\mu \fpDP(t) + (p-p^\prime)_\mu \fmDP(t),
   \label{eqn:intro:ME}
   \\
   \fzDP(t)
   & = & 
   \fpDP(t) + \frac{t}{M_D^2-M_P^2} \fmDP(t),
   \label{eqn:intro:f0}
\eea
where 
$P$ specifies the light meson ($P\!=\!\pi,K$)
and $t=(p-p^\prime)^2$ is the momentum transfer.
The current accuracy of $|V_{cd}|$ and $|V_{cs}|$ is limited 
by the theoretical uncertainty of $\fpzDP$~\cite{CKM16}.
Lattice QCD is the only known method to calculate $\fpzDP$
with controlled and systematically-improvable uncertainties.

In this article, 
we report on our calculation of these form factors in $N_f\!=\!2+1$ QCD
with the tree-level improved Symanzik gauge action
and the M\"obius domain wall quark action~\cite{MDWF}.
%
Numerical simulations are carried out at three lattice cutoffs
$a^{-1}\!\sim\!2.5$, 3.6 and 4.5 GeV.
On such fine lattices, we employ the domain-wall action
also for charm quarks.
%
The simulated values of $m_{ud}$, 
that is the mass of the degenerate up and down quarks,
cover a range of the pion mass 
$300~\mbox{MeV}\!\lesssim\!M_\pi\!\lesssim\!500$~MeV.
We take a strange quark mass $m_s$ close to its physical value.
An additional value of $m_s$ is simulated at certain choices of $(a,m_{ud})$
in order to study the $m_s$ dependence of the form factors.
The charm quark mass is set to its physical value 
determined from the $D$ meson spectrum~\cite{Lat15:Fahy}.
%
The physical charm quark mass extracted from the same set of 
simulations is $m_c(3~\mbox{GeV})\!=\!1.003(10)$\,GeV,
which is consistent with the present world average~\cite{mc:JLQCD}.
%
Our simulation parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:intro:status}.
%
After the previous report~\cite{Lat15:Suzuki},
we extend our simulation to the two finer lattices and 
improve our measurement method to reduce the statistical uncertainty.

At each simulation point, 
our lattice size satisfies a condition $M_\pi L \!\gtrsim\!4$ 
to control finite volume effects, 
and we accumulate 5,000 Molecular Dynamics time.
Chiral symmetry is preserved to good accuracy 
by choosing the sign function approximation and the kernel operator
in the 4-dimensional effective action~\cite{MDWF:JLQCD}.
The residual mass is suppressed to $O(1~\mbox{MeV})$ at the coarsest lattice,
and even smaller $\lesssim\!0.2$~MeV at finer lattices
with moderate sizes in the fifth dimension $\sim\!10$.



%// measurement ---------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Calculation of form factors}

%// calculation of 3-pt function

We calculate the three-point function
\bea
    C^{DP}_{V_\mu}
    (\bfp,\bfp^\prime;\dt,\dtp)
    & = &
    \frac{1}{N_s^3\,N_\tsrc}
    \sum_{\tsrc}
    \sum_{\bfx,\bfxp,\bfxpp} 
    \langle 
       {\calO}_P(\bfxpp,\tsrc+\dt+\dtp) 
    \nn \\
    &&
    \hspace{10mm}
       \times
       V_\mu(\bfxp,\tsrc+\dt)
       {\calO}_D^{\dagger}(\bfx,\tsrc)
    \rangle
    e^{-i\bfpp\left( \bfxpp - \bfxp \right)}
    e^{-i\bfp\left( \bfxp - \bfx \right)},
    \hspace{10mm}
    \label{eqn:sim:msn_corr:msn_corr_3pt}  
\eea
where 
$N_s$ is the spatial lattice size and 
$\bfp^{(\prime)}$ represents the momentum of the initial (final) meson.
We apply a Gaussian smearing to the meson interpolating operators
${\calO}_{\{\pi,K,D\}}$.
The temporal coordinate of the source operator is denoted by $\tsrc$,
and $\dt^{(\prime)}$ represents 
the temporal separation between the source (sink) operator 
and the vector current $V_\mu$.


%// setup 

In this study,
we calculate $C^{DP}_{V_\mu}(\bfp,\bfp^\prime;\dt,\dtp)$ 
by varying $\dt$ with $\dt\!+\!\dtp$ kept fixed. 
Its physical length is the same for the three cutoffs 
and is chosen as $\dt\!+\!\dtp\!=\!28a$ at $\beta\!=\!4.17$~\cite{Lat15:Suzuki}.
%
The $D$ meson is at rest ($\bfp\!=\!\bfz$),
and we simulate four different values of the momentum transfer $t$
with light meson momenta $|\bfpp|^2\!=\!0,1,2,3$ in units of $(2\pi/L)^2$.
For $P\!=\!\pi(K)$,
the minimum value of the momentum transfer is typically 
$t_{\rm min}\!\approx\!0.3(0.2)\,\mbox{GeV}^2$,
while the maximum is $t_{\rm max}\!\approx\!2.6(1.8)\,\mbox{GeV}^2$.


%// extraction of FFs

We also calculate two-point functions of $\pi$, $K$ and $D$ mesons.
The amplitudes of the correlators are extracted
by the following exponential fits in terms of $\dt$ 
\bea
   C_{V_\mu}^{DP}(\bfp,\bfpp;\dt,\dtp)
   & = &
   A_{V_\mu}^{DP}(\bfp,\bfpp) e^{-E_D(\bfp)\dt}e^{-E_P(\bfpp)\dtp}
   \hspace{5mm}
   (P\!=\!\pi,K),
   \\ 
   C^Q(\bfp;\dt)
   & = &
   B^Q(\bfp) e^{-E_Q(\bfp)\dt}
   \hspace{5mm}
   (Q\!=\!\pi,K,D).
   \label{eqn:amp}
\eea
Here the meson energies $E_{\{\pi,K,D\}}$ are estimated
from their rest masses~\cite{Lat15:Fahy}
and the dispersion relation in the continuum limit.
%
The matrix elements are given as
\bea
   \langle P(\bfpp) | V_\mu | D(\bfp) \rangle
   & = &
   2 Z_V
   \sqrt{
      \frac{ E_D(\bfp)\,E_P(\bfpp)\, |A_{V_\mu}^{DP}(\bfp,\bfpp)|^2 }
           { B^D(\bfp)\,B^P(\bfpp) }
   },
\eea
where we use the renormalization factor $Z_V$
non-perturbatively calculated in Ref.~\cite{NPR:JLQCD}.
The relevant semileptonic form factors are then extracted
via Eqs.~(\ref{eqn:intro:ME}) and (\ref{eqn:intro:f0}).

% The $D\!\to\!\pi$ and $D\!\to\!K$ form factors are extracted from
% these $P\!\to\!D$ matrix elements by noting
% $f_+^{DP}(q^2)\!=\!f_+^{PD}(q^2)$ and $f_-^{DP}(q^2)\!=\!-f_-^{PD}(q^2)$.


%// source location average

In order to improve the statistical accuracy,
we average the three- and two-point functions
over the locations of the source operator.
As for the temporal location, 
we repeat our measurement over $N_\tsrc$ different values of $\tsrc$.
Our choice of $N_\tsrc$ is summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:intro:status}.
An important improvement from Ref.~\cite{Lat15:Suzuki}
is to average over the spatial coordinates $\bfx$ as well
by putting the Gaussian source operator associated with a $Z_2$ noise
at each lattice site at a given time-slice $\tsrc$.

      at $\beta\!=\!4.17$ and $(m_{ud},m_s)\!=\!(0.0190,0.0400)$.
      The open triangles show data with a ``local'' Gaussian source
      and a single choice of $\bfp$.
      The blue squares and red circles are obtained
      by averaging over the location of the source operator
      and then over 12 $\bfp$'s.
      All data are normalized by their value at $\dt\!=\!18$.
   }
   \label{fig:ff:comp}
\end{center}
\vspace{0mm}
\end{figure}


%// comparizon and statistical accuracy

Figure~\ref{fig:ff:comp} compares our results for the amplitude $A_{V_4}^{D\pi}$
with different measurement setups
on our coarsest lattice at the heaviest sea quark masses.
We observe about 30\,\% reduction of the statistical error
by averaging over 2 $t_{\rm src}$'s
and an additional 30\,\% reduction by averaging over $\bfx$:
about a factor of two improvement in total.
%
Averaging over $\bfp$ further improves the statistical accuracy:
at $|\bfp|^2\!=\!2$, for instance,
about factor of two improvement by averaging over 12 $\bfp$'s.
%
The typical statistical accuracy is
1\,--\,2\,\% at $t_{\rm max}$ and $M_\pi\!\sim\!500$~MeV,
and 6\,--\,9\,\% at $t_{\rm min}$ and $M_\pi\!\sim\!300$~MeV.




%// momentum transfer dependence -----------------------------------------------

\section{Momentum transfer dependence}


%// z parameter

We parametrize the momentum transfer dependence
of the form factors in terms of the so-called $z$ parameter~\cite{z}
\bea
   z(t,t_0)
   & = &
   \frac{ \sqrt{t_+-t} - \sqrt{t_+-t_0} }
        { \sqrt{t_+-t} + \sqrt{t_+-t_0} },
   \label{eqn:q2-dep:z}
\eea
where $t_+\!=\!(M_D+M_P)^2$ represents the $DP$ threshold ($P\!=\!\pi$, $K$).
The free parameter $t_0$ is chosen so that
our simulated region $t\!\in\![t_{\rm min},t_{\rm max}]$
is mapped into a shortest segment 
$z\!\in\!\left[-|z|_{\rm max},+|z|_{\rm max}\right]$
centered at the origin.
Typical size of the $z$ parameter is $|z|_{\rm max}\!\lesssim\!0.2$.


\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.60\linewidth,clip]%
                   {./fig2.pdf}

   \caption{
      Plot of $B(t)\,f_{\{+,0\}}^{D\pi}(t)$ as a function of $z$

      Circles and squares are data for $f_+$ and $f_0$, respectively.
      Filled symbols show
      $(1-t/M_{D^*_{(0)}}^2) f_{+(0)}^{D\pi}(t)$

      and $f_0$ (open symbols) is shown by solid and dashed lines.
      The vertical dot-dashed line represents $z$ corresponding $t\!=\!0$,
      and the diamond is the value extrapolated to $t\!=\!0$.
   }
   \label{fig:q2-dep:ff_vs_z}
\end{center}
\vspace{0mm}
\end{figure}

%// z parameter

The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors are then
parametrized by using this small parameter as 
\bea
   \fpzDP(t)
   & = &
   \frac{1}{B(t)} \sum_{k=0}^{N_{\{+,0\}}} a_{\{+,0\},k}\, z^k.
   \label{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z}
\eea
In this preliminary analysis,
we test two choices of the factor $B(t)$. 
In the so-called Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) parametrization~\cite{BCL}
with 
\bea
   B(t) = 1 - \frac{t}{M_{\rm pole}^2},
   \label{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:bcl}
\eea   
possibly small deviation from the lowest pole contribution $1/B(t)$
is expanded in terms of $z$.
We also test a naive polynomial expansion of the form factors themselves
with 
\bea
   B(t) = 1.
   \label{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:poly}
\eea


%// plot

Figure~\ref{fig:q2-dep:ff_vs_z} shows 
$z$-dependence of a quantity $B(t)\fpzDpi(t)$ to be expanded in terms of $z$.
Namely, $B(t)f_{+(0)}^{D\pi}(t)\!=\!(1-t/M_{D^*_{(0)}}^2) f_{+(0)}^{D\pi}(t)$ 
for the BCL parametrization with Eq.~(\ref{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:bcl}),
whereas it is just the form factor for the polynomial expansion 
with Eq.~(\ref{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:poly}).


%// f+

For $\fpDP$, 
we use the vector meson masses $M_{D_{(s)}^*}$ calculated at the simulation points,
which are well below the threshold $t_+$. 
We observe that the $z$ dependence of $B(t)\fpDP(t)$ is significantly reduced
by switching from the polynomial expansion (\ref{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:poly})
to the BCL parametrization (\ref{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:bcl}).
This suggests that the vector meson dominance (VMD) hypothesis is
a reasonably good approximation of $\fpDP$,
and we can expand the small deviation from the VMD
in terms of small $z$.
In this study, we test
two BCL parametrization
including the linear ($N_+\!=\!1$) and quadratic terms ($N_+\!=\!2$).


%// f0

We have not yet calculated the scalar meson masses $M_{D_{(s)0}^*}$,
and hence it is not clear whether there exist
corresponding isolated poles below $t_+$ at simulated $M_\pi$'s.
In this analysis,
we employ the simple linear expansion (\ref{eqn:q2-dep:ff_vs_z:poly})
for $\fzDP$.
We also test 
the BCL parametrization ($N_0\!=\!1$) 
with the experimental value of $M_{D_{(s)0}^*}$
by assuming its mild dependence on $m_{ud}$.


%// simultaneous fit 

We estimate the normalization $\fpDP(0)\!=\!\fzDP(0)$
from the simultaneous fit
using the BCL parametrization with $N_+\!=\!1$ for $\fpDP$
and the linear parametrization ($N_0\!=\!1$) for $\fzDP$.
We also test above-mentioned alternative forms
to estimate the systematic uncertainty of the extrapolation to $t\!=\!0$.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:q2-dep:ff_vs_z}, however, 
the $z$ dependence of our results is mild 
except the polynomial parametrization for $\fpDP$. 
The systematic uncertainty is not large compared to
the statistical accuracy.


%// continuum + chiral extrapolation -------------------------------------------

      of the CLEO-c data of $\fpDpi(t)$~\cite{CLEO-c}

      of $\fpDpi(0)$~\cite{FLAG3}.
   }
   \label{fig:cont+chiral_fit:mud-dep_a-dep}
\end{center}
\vspace{0mm}
\end{figure}

%// mild depndence 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:cont+chiral_fit:mud-dep_a-dep}, 
we compare $\fpzDpi$ at different pion masses (left panel)
and at different lattice spacings (right panel).
The reasonable consistency in both panels
suggests a mild dependence on $M_\pi$ and $a$. 
We note that the decay constants $f_{D_{(s)}}$ also have 
small discretization errors 
with our choice of the lattice action and cutoffs~\cite{Lat16:Fahy}.

In this preliminary analysis, therefore,
we parametrize the $a$, $m_{ud}$ and $m_s$ dependences of $\fpDP(0)$
by the following simple linear form
\bea
   \fpDP(0)
   & = & 
   c^{DP}
 + c_{a}^{DP} a^2
 + c_{\pi}^{DP} M_\pi^2
 + c_{\eta_s}^{DP} M_{\eta_s}^2,
\eea
where $M_{\eta_s}^2\!=\!2M_K^2-M_\pi^2$.
This continuum and chiral extrapolation is plotted 
in Fig~\ref{fig:cont+chiral_fit:lin}.
We obtain $\chi^2/{\rm d.o.f}\!\sim\!1.6$\,--\,1.8.
All the coefficients $c_{\{a,\pi,\eta_s\}}^{DP}$ 
have $\gtrsim\,75$\,\% statistical error:
namely, consistent with zero
as expected from the good consistency 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:cont+chiral_fit:mud-dep_a-dep}.
This fit is therefore not sensitive to higher order corrections,
and we estimate the systematic uncertainty 
from three fits 
in which one of the three coefficients $c_{\{a,\pi,\eta_s\}}^{DP}$ is set to zero.
%
Our preliminary estimates 
\bea
   f_+^{D\pi}(0)
   = 
   0.644(49)(27),
   \hspace{5mm}
   f_+^{DK}(0)
   =
   0.701(46)(33).
\eea
are consistent with recent lattice averages 
$f_+^{D\pi}(0)\!=\!0.666(29)$ and $f_+^{DK}(0)\!=\!0.747(19)$~\cite{FLAG3}.

\section{Summary}

In this article, we report on our lattice calculation
of the $D\!\to\!\pi$ and $D\!\to\!K$ semileptonic form factors.
We employ the M\"obius domain-wall quark action 
both for light and charm quarks,
and simulate lattice cutoffs up to 4.5~GeV.

Our preliminary results for $\fpDpiK(0)$ have uncertainty of 8 (9)\,\%. 
We expect significant improvement in the near future 
by increasing statistics ($N_\tsrc$) on the finest lattice 
and extending our measurements to smaller $M_\pi\!\sim\!230$~MeV.

We observe small discretization errors of the $D$ meson form factors
with our simulation setup. It is therefore interesting to extend 
our study to the $B$ meson semileptonic decays, 
which are being precisely measured at SuperKEKB/Belle II and LHCb
experiments.
