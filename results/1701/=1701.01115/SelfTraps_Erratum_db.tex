%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After publication of the paper `Self-induced dust traps: overcoming planet formation barriers' in MNRAS 467, 1984 (2017), we discovered an inconsequential error in Appendix~C.

Steady-state expressions of the radial velocities for both the gas and dust phases of a dusty disc, taking into account the back-reaction of dust on gas, have been calculated by several authors, for different conditions \citep[e.g.][]{Nakagawa1986,Kretke2009,Dipierro2017,Kanagawa2017}. They are usually written as functions of the Stokes number for the gas-dust mixture $\St'$ and the dust-to-gas ratio $\epsilon=\rho_\mathrm{d}/\rho_\mathrm{g}$. In equation~(C1), we gave the steady-state expression of the radial velocity of the viscous gas phase of a dusty disc as a function of the more commonly used Stokes number defined for the dust only, $\St$, related to $\St'$ by $\St'=\St/(1+\epsilon)$ \citep{Price2015}:
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{r@{\ }c@{\ }l}
v_\mathrm{g} 
& = & -f_\mathrm{drag} \, \displaystyle\frac{1}{\Sigma_\mathrm{g} \Omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(c_\mathrm{s}^2 \Sigma_\mathrm{g} \right) + f_\mathrm{visc} \, \frac{\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( \Sigma_\mathrm{g} \nu r^3 \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial r} \right)}{r \Sigma_\mathrm{g} \displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \Omega \right)}, \\
& \equiv & v_\mathrm{g,drag} + v_\mathrm{g,visc} ,
\label{eq:vgr}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
f_\mathrm{drag} = \frac{\epsilon}{(1 + \epsilon)^2 \St^{-1} + \St} . \label{eq:fdrag}
\end{equation}
%
When replacing $\St'$ by its expression as a function of $\St$, we mistakenly wrote that $f_\mathrm{visc}=1$. The correct expression is
%
\begin{equation}
f_\mathrm{visc} = \frac{(1 + \epsilon)\,\St^{-1} + \St}{(1 + \epsilon)^2 \St^{-1} + \St} . \label{eq:fvisc}
\end{equation}
%
As a consequence, equation~(C10) should now read
%
\begin{equation}
x_\mathrm{br} \equiv \frac{\left| v_\mathrm{g,drag} \right| }{ \left| v_\mathrm{g,visc} \right| } \simeq \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{f_\mathrm{drag}}{f_\mathrm{visc}},
\label{eq:def_xbr}
\end{equation}
%
and Fig.~C1 should be replaced with the current Fig.~\ref{Fig:x_br}. It shows that both $f_\mathrm{visc}$ and $x_\mathrm{br}$ are little affected for small values of $\epsilon$. For $\epsilon\sim1$, the effect of back-reaction on the gas phase is up to twice as large, strengthening the conclusions of the initial study.
