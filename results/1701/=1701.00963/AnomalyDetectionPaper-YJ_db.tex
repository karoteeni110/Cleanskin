% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

%To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is crucial that the network is able to detect anomalies in communication quality (e.g., RSSI) which may cause  performance degradation, so that the network can react accordingly. To this end, we propose RADIUS in this paper, which is a new lightweight threshold-based approach. In comparison with two popular thresholding approaches in the WSN literature, the performance of RADIUS is consistently more robust to the user-chosen parameter in them. In addition, with integrated techniques aiming at minimizing the detection error (caused by normal randomness of RSSI) in discriminating good links from weak links, RADIUS is able to achieve high detection accuracy under diverse link conditions. Specifically, in a prototype system deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that RADIUS maintains a stable detection error of 6.13\% on average  in detecting link quality anomalies for all links across the network. %Old. For RADIUS as an approach. 

To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is crucial that the network is able to detect anomalies in communication quality (e.g., RSSI), which may cause  performance degradation, so that the network can react accordingly. In this paper, we introduce RADIUS, a lightweight system for the purpose. The design of RADIUS is aimed at minimizing the detection error (caused by normal randomness of RSSI) in discriminating good links from weak links and at reaching high detection accuracy under diverse link conditions and dynamic environment changes. Central to the design is a threshold-based decision approach that has its foundation on the Bayes decision theory. In RADIUS, various techniques are developed to address challenges inherent in applying this approach. In addition, through extensive experiments, proper configuration of the parameters involved in these techniques is identified for an indoor environment. In a prototype implementation of the RADIUS system deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that RADIUS is accurate in detecting anomalous link quality degradation for all links across the network, maintaining a stable error rate of 6.13\% on average. %The RADIUS system is implemented and evaluated on an indoor testbed and the results show that RADIUS is accurate in detecting link quality anomalies for all links across the network, maintaining a stable error rate of 6.13\% on average.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% previous version %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is crucial to detect true anomalies in communication quality, not contributed by its normal randomness but caused by real signal attenuation that are significant enough to cause the performance degradation so that the network can react accordingly. In this paper, we propose RADIUS, a lightweight approach that provides minimized error in detecting link quality anomalies while being robust to different deployment areas and environment changes. 
%Specifically, RADIUS lays its foundation on Bayes decision theory. The achieved high accuracy is robust across the network as compared to two popular detection techniques in WSNs.In addition, RADIUS employs various supporting techniques that further improve the accuracy and assist in adapting the detection threshold to environment changes. Extensive experiments show that the employed supporting techniques significantly increase the system performance and the best configuration of involved parameters is identified for indoor environments. In a prototype system deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that RADIUS is accurate in  detecting link quality anomalies for all links across the network, achieving a stable low detection error of 6.13\% on average.

%To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is crucial to detect anomalies in communication quality so that the network can react accordingly. In this paper, we propose RADIUS, a lightweight approach that provides minimized error in detecting link quality anomalies while being robust to different parameter settings and environment changes. Specifically, RADIUS lays its foundation on Bayes decision theory (minimizing detection error), together with techniques that assist in adapting the detection threshold (achieving robustness).
%%motivated by a comparison to two popular detection techniques in WSNs,
%Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of the involved parameters on the detection performance, identifying the best configuration for indoor environments. In a prototype system deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that RADIUS is accurate in  detecting link quality anomalies for all links across the network, achieving a stable low detection error of 6.13\% on average. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECON version %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%To ensure proper functioning of a wireless sensor network (WSN), it is crucial that the network is able to detect anomalies in communication quality changes so that the network can react accordingly. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, called \textit{RADIUS}, which is simple, robust and adaptive. Specifically, \textit{RADIUS} is a threshold-based approach (simple), with foundation on Bayes decision theory (robust), together with techniques that assist in adapting the threshold (adaptive). In addition, extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of the involved parameters on the detection performance, which gives insights on the setting of them. Moreover, a system implementation of \textit{RADIUS} is introduced and its performance has been investigated on a testbed. The results show that \textit{RADIUS} is not only robust to dynamic changes but also accurate in detection, achieving an average detection error rate as low as 6.13\% on the testbed.
