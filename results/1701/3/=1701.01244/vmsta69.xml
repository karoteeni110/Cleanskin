<outline text="Introduction" _note="Consider a fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a self-similar Gaussian process with stationary increments. It was introduced by Kolmogorov and studied by Mandelbrot and Van Ness . The fBm with Hurst parameter is a centered Gaussian process with covariance function If , then the process is a standard Brownian motion. When , is neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process, so that many of the techniques employed in stochastic analysis are not available for an fBm. The self-similarity and stationarity of increments make the fBm an appropriate model for many applications in diverse fields from biology to finance. We refer to for details on these notions.  Consider the following stochastic differential equation (SDE) where is a measurable function, and is a -dimensional fBm with Hurst parameter whose components are one-dimensional independent fBms defined on a probability space , where the filtration is generated by , , augmented by the -null sets. It has been proved in that if satisfies the assumption for , then Eq. ( ) has a unique strong solution, which will be assumed throughout this paper.  Notice that if the drift coefficient is Lipschitz continuous, then Eq. ( ) has a unique strong solution, which is continuous with respect to the initial condition. Moreover, the solution can be constructed using various numerical schemes.  Our purpose in this paper is to establish some stability results under the pathwise uniqueness of solutions and under weak regularity conditions on the drift coefficient . We mention that a considerable result in this direction has been established in when an fBm is replaced by a standard Brownian motion.  The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some properties, notation, definitions, and preliminary results. Section 3 is devoted to the study of the variation of solution with respect to the initial data. In the last section, we drop the continuity assumption on the drift and try to obtain the same result as in Section 3.">

<outline text="Preliminaries" _note="In this section, we give some properties of an fBm, definitions, and some tools used in the proofs.  For any , let us define the square-integrable kernel where , .  Note that Let be an fBm defined on . We denote by the set of step functions on . Let be the Hilbert space defined as the closure of with respect to the scalar product The mapping can be extended to an isometry between and the Gaussian subspace of associated with , and such an isometry is denoted by .  Now we introduce the linear operator from to defined by The operator is an isometry between and , which can be extended to the Hilbert space .  Define the process by Then is a Brownian motion; moreover, has the integral representation We need also to define an isomorphism from onto associated with the kernel in terms of the fractional integrals as follows: Note that, for , is the left fractional Riemann-Liouville integral operator of order defined by where is the gamma function (see for details).  The inverse of is given by where for , is the left-sided Riemann Liouville derivative of order defined by If is absolutely continuous (see ), then  On a given probability space , a process is called a strong solution to if   is adapted, where is the filtration generated by ;   satisfies .  A sextuple is called a weak solution to if   is a probability space equipped with the filtration that satisfies the usual   is an -adapted process, and is an -fBm;   and satisfy .  We say that pathwise uniqueness holds for Eq.  if whenever and are two weak solutions of Eq.  defined on the same probability space , then and are indistinguishable.  The main tool used in the proofs is Skorokhod’s selection theorem given by the following lemma.  Let be a complete separable metric space, and let , , , be probability measures on such that converges weakly to as . Then, on a probability space , we can construct -valued random variables , , , such that:  , , and , where and are respectively the laws of and ;   converges to -a.s.  We will also make use of the following result, which gives a criterion for the tightness of sequences of laws associated with continuous processes.    Let , , , be a sequence of -dimensional continuous processes satisfying the following two conditions:  There exist positive constants and such that for every ;  there exist positive constants , , , , such that, for every and all , ,  Then, there exist a subsequence , a probability space , and -dimensional continuous processes , , , defined on such that  The laws of and coincide;   converges to uniformly on every finite time interval -a.s.">

<outline text="Variation of solutions with respect to initial conditions" _note="The purpose of this section is to ensure the continuous dependence of the solution with respect to the initial condition when the drift is continuous and bounded. Note that, in the case of ordinary differential equation, the continuity of the coefficient is sufficient to ensure this dependence.  Next, we give a theorem that will be essential in establishing the desired result.    Let be a continuous bounded function. Then, under the pathwise uniqueness for SDE , we have  Before we proceed to the proof of Theorem  , we state the following technical lemma.    Let be the solution of corresponding to the initial condition . Then, for every , there exists a positive constant such that, for all ,  Fix in . We have Due to the stationarity of the increments and the scaling property of an fBm and the boundedness of , we get that which finishes the proof.  Let us now turn to the proof of Theorem  .  Suppose that the result of the theorem is false. Then there exist a constant and a sequence converging to such that Let (respectively, ) be the solution of ( ) corresponding to the initial condition (respectively, ). According to Lemma  , the sequence satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma  . Then, by Skorokhod’s selection theorem there exist a subsequence , a probability space , and stochastic processes , , , defined on such that:  for each , the laws of and coincide;   converges to uniformly on every finite time interval -a.s.  Thanks to property , we have, for and , In other words, satisfies the following SDE: Similarly, Using , we deduce that and in probability and uniformly in .  Thus, the processes and satisfy the same SDE on with the same driving noise and the initial condition . Then, by pathwise uniqueness, we conclude that for all , -a.s.  On the other hand, by uniform integrability we have that which is a contradiction. Then the desired result follows.">

<outline text="The case of discontinuous drift coefficient" _note="In this section, we drop the continuity assumption on the drift coefficient and only assume that is bounded. The goal of this section is to generate the same result as in Theorem   without the continuity assumption.  Next, in order to use the fractional Girsanov theorem given in we should first check that the conditions imposed in the latter are satisfied in our context. This will be done in the following lemma.    Suppose that is a solution of SDE , and let be a bounded function. Then the process enjoys the following properties:  ;  .  \(1) In light of , we can write where denotes the norm in .  As a result, we get that (2) The second item is obtained easily by the following estimate: where , which finishes the proof.  Next, we will establish the following Krylov-type inequality that will play an essential role in the sequel.    Suppose that is a solution of SDE . Then, there exists such that, for any measurable nonnegative function , we have where is a constant depending only on , , , and .  Let be a -dimensional Brownian motion such that For the process introduced in Lemma  , let us define by Then, in light of Lemma   together with the fractional Girsanov theorem , we can conclude that is a probability measure under which the process is an fBm.  Now, applying Hölder’s inequality, we have where , and is a positive constant depending only on , , and .  From we can see that satisfies the following property: where is a continuous increasing function depending only on , , and .  On the other hand, applying again Hölder’s inequality with and , we obtain A direct calculation gives Plugging this into , we get Finally, combining this with and , we get estimate with . The proof is now complete.  Now we are able to state the main result of this section.  If the pathwise uniqueness holds for Eq. , then without the continuity assumption on the drift coefficient, the conclusion of Theorem   remains valid.  The proof is similar to that of Theorem  . The only difficulty is to show that in probability. In other words, for , we will show that Let us first define where denotes the convolution on , and is an infinitely differentiable function with support in the unit ball such that .  Applying Chebyshev’s inequality, we obtain From the continuity of in and from the convergence of to uniformly on every finite time interval a.s. it follows that converges to 0 as for every .  On the other hand, let be a smooth truncation function such that in the unit ball and for .  By applying Lemma   we obtain where does not depend on and , and denotes the norm in .  The last expression in the right-hand side of the last inequality satisfies the following estimate: But we know that for all , and thus Substituting estimate into , letting , and using , we deduce that the convergence of the term follows.  Finally, since estimate also holds for , it suffices to use the same arguments as before to obtain the convergence of the term , which completes the proof.">
