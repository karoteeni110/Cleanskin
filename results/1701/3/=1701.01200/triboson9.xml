    <title> A renormalization method for three-boson system with a triboson field</title>
    <abstract>A renormalization method that introduces an auxiliary field to represent
a three-body bound state is studied in a three-boson system with a
triboson field. A cutoff dependence in the three-boson system emerges as
a limit cycle, and the cyclic singularity is renormalized by employing
two methods: a standard method and the auxiliary field method. For each
method, different sets of diagrams are involved for renormalization, and
thus we numerically study three quantities: counter term for
renormalization, scattering length of -wave boson-diboson scattering,
and normalized wavefunction. We confirm that the two methods would lead
to the same result. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The studies of three-body systems in pionless effective field theory (EFT) revealed a nontrivial feature of the systems. That is an appearance of a cyclic singularity, known as a limit cycle, in a three-boson system  and a three-nucleon system in triton channel . A three-body contact interaction, whose order is naively counted as that in higher order, is promoted to leading order (LO) for renormalization of the singularity. The appearance of the limit cycle is accompanied by emergence of bound states, known as Efimov states, in the unitary limit . For recent studies of the three-nucleon systems in triton and He channels, one may refer to Refs. . (For general reviews of the pionless EFT, one may refer to Refs. .) This feature is also applied to the studies of the various systems, e.g., halo-nuclei  and hyper-nuclei .  One of the issues of the three-nucleon systems in pionless EFT is to establish a rigorous perturbative method to expand an amplitude in terms of effective range terms because the major part of the previous works employed an approximation so called partially resummed approach . A fully perturbative method for a calculation of scattering in pionless EFT was suggested by Vanasse. However, it is not easy to apply the method to a study involving a bound state . Recently, the same author suggested a new method to deal with a bound state perturbatively by introducing a tribaryon field, which represents the bound state of triton, and the method was applied to a calculation of charge radius of the triton up to next-to-next-to-leading order .  This new method introduces an auxiliary field which represents a bound state of a three-body system. A dressed three-body propagator is constructed by using the auxiliary field, and a coupling constant of the auxiliary field is determined so that a pole position of the three-body binding energy is reproduced in the dressed three-body propagator. An advantage of the new method is that it is not necessary to numerically fit the coupling constant of the three-body part by employing Newton’s method. The method has originally been introduced by Hagen et al., and they applied it to the study of electric form factor of two-neutron halo systems .  In this short report, we study the renormalization method suggested by Hagen et al. by employing a simple system, three neutral scalar boson system of equal masses with a triboson field. Using a simple system is beneficial to a study of the renormalization method itself since it avoids detailed calculations. The system exhibits a limit cycle, thus a sharp momentum cutoff is introduced in an integral equation for the three-boson system, and a value of a three-body coupling is determined as functions of by employing two methods: a standard method and the auxiliary field method. In the two methods, as to be discussed in detail later, sets of diagrams involved in the scattering amplitude are the same. However, those for renormalization and calculations of a normalized wavefunction are different. So it would be worth confirming that the two different methods lead to an identical result. We then numerically calculate scattering length of -wave boson-diboson scattering and normalized wavefunctions, and we confirm that the two method would lead to the same result.  This work is organized as following. In Sec. 2, an effective Lagrangian for a three-boson system with a triboson field is displayed, and in Sec. 3, two-body and three-body parts of an equation for the three-body system are constructed from the Lagrangian for the two renormalization methods. In Sec. 4, numerical results are obtained, and finally in Sec. 5, results and discussion of the work are presented.">

<outline text="Lagrangian" _note="To study the renormalization method for a three-body system, we consider a simple system, three neutral scalar bosons having equal masses, which makes a two-body bound state and a three-body bound state. In addition, we employ standard counting rules in pionless EFT for two and three-body systems . Here we consider LO contributions only. Thus we employ a simple Lagrangian for the three-boson system including diboson and triboson fields as  &amp;=&amp; \^( i\_0 + \^2 ) +\ &amp;&amp; + d\^\_d d - 12 y\_d (d\^+ \^\^d) +\ &amp;&amp; + t\^\_t t - y\_t (t\^d+ d\^\^t) + , where , , and are boson, diboson, and triboson fields, respectively, and is the boson mass. The dots denote higher order terms which have more derivatives. Four parameters, , , , and , appear in the Lagrangian at LO. and are fixed by using two and three-body binding energies, and , respectively, whereas and can arbitrarily be chosen.">

  <outline text="Three-body part" _note="We construct the three-body part in two ways. We refer to a conventional method as “standard renormalization method” (SM) and, to the one suggested by Hagen et al., the “auxiliary field renormalization method” (AM) in the following.">
    <outline text="Standard renormalization method (SM)" _note="In Fig.  , diagrams of an integral equation for -wave boson-diboson scattering in terms of a scattering amplitude are depicted.     Thus one has an integral equation from the diagrams in Fig.   as \ &amp;&amp; - \^\_0 dl l\^2,     where is the scattering amplitude of -wave boson-diboson scattering and () is the magnitude of off-shell (on-shell) relative momentum in final (initial) boson-diboson state in center of mass frame. A sharp cutoff is introduced for renormalization in the equation. For the renormalization using the three-body binding energy, the homogeneous part of the integral equation in Eq. ( ) is numerically solved by choosing , and the parameter is fitted as a function of . The numerical method to solve the equation is described in Ref. .">

    <outline text="Auxiliary field renormalization method (AM)" _note="For the auxiliary field renormalization method (AM), Feynman diagrams of the on-shell scattering amplitude are depicted in Fig.  . The scattering amplitude is represented as  t(k,k) = a(k,k) + b(k,k),   where is a scattering amplitude without including the triboson field. In Fig.  , diagrams of the scattering amplitude are depicted, and is calculated by solving the integral equation in Eq. ( ) without including the triboson field. On the other hand, is a scattering amplitude through the propagation of a dressed triboson field, b(k,k) = - Y\_t(k,E)D\_t(E)Y\_t(k,E) , where is a dressed boson-diboson-triboson vertex function, and is a dressed triboson propagator.  In Fig.  , diagrams of the dressed boson-diboson-triboson vertex are depicted. Thus one has an integral equation for as Y\_t(p,E) &amp;=&amp; y\_t - \^\_0 dl l\^2 ( ) .    In Fig.  , diagrams for the dressed triboson propagator, which is obtained by summing a self-energy term up to infinite order, are depicted. Thus, from the diagrams, one has the dressed triboson propagator as D\_t(E) = ,   where is the self-energy term whose diagrams are depicted in Fig.  .  Thus we have \_t(E) = \^\_0 dl .   The parameter is fixed so as to reproduce the pole structure of the three-body binding energy at in the dressed triboson propagator. We note that the diagrams involving in the scattering state in Figs.   and   for SM and AM, respectively, are the same, whereas those for renormalization using the three-body binding energy are different. For example, an infinite loop diagram due to one-boson-exchange interaction is included for renormalization in SM, whereas this term exists in the amplitude and is excluded for renormalization in AM.">

Then the integral equation becomes scale free, and that indicates a power behavior of the amplitudes in the asymptotic limit, t(p,k), a(p,k), Y\_t(p,E) p\^[s-1]{}.   After performing a Mellin transformation in Eq. ( ) using the relation in Eq. ( ), one has  1 = . The solution of for the equation becomes imaginary, and . The imaginary solution indicates the emergence of a limit cycle. The limit cycle exhibiting in is renormalized by the three-body counter term in SM, whereas those in and (as well as ) are not in AM. They will be sensitive to a value of the cutoff , and bound states emerge as Efimov states in them.  Apart from the diagrams involving in the renormalization are different in the two methods, when the dressed three-body propagator is renormalized in AM so as to reproduce the three-body binding pole in it, other bound states can emerge as Efimov states in the other parts, and , in the amplitude . In addition, when a normalized wavefunction is derived in AM, the wavefunction is obtained from the amplitude , and the amplitude is excluded from the derivation of the wavefunction even though bound states are generated in it. Those observations are the main concern in the present work, and we are going to numerically study them in the next section.">

<outline text="Numerical results" _note="The three-boson system we study in the present work may not have a corresponding real physical system. Thus, for numerical study of the renormalization method in the three-boson system, we employ values of mass, two and three-body binding energies of the three-nucleon system in triton channel: &amp;&amp; m = 940 ,   B\_2 = 2.22 ,   B\_3 = 8.48 , and the binding momentum for the diboson system is .">
  <outline text="Renormalization at three-body binding energy" _note="The integral equations in Eqs. ( ) and ( ) exhibit a limit cycle, and we renormalize the cyclic singularity at the three-body binding energy, , with a given value of the cutoff by employing the two methods, SM and AM.  For the standard renormalization method, SM, we solve the homogeneous part of the integral equation in Eq. ( ) employing a standard expression of the counter term as  = - .   For the auxiliary field renormalization method, AM, on the other hand, the coupling constant is determined by using the pole position of three-body bound state in the dressed triboson propagator in Eq. ( ) as  \_t - \_t(-B\_3) = 0.   Using Eq. ( ) we have H() = -,   for AM. We note that for AM does not depend on because of . In addition, as mentioned above, the diagrams for renormalization involving in SM and AM are different. In SM, one has -loop diagrams with from the homogeneous part of the integral equation in Eq. ( ), and a value of is numerically searched by using Newton’s method at the point where the determinant of the matrix vanishes with . In AM, on the other hand, one has all possible bubble diagrams in the self-energy term, in Eq. ( ), and a value of is calculated using Eq. ( ).  In Fig.  , we plot curves of as functions of for SM and AM.  For the both methods, SM and AM, we reproduce a cyclic pattern in the counter term representing a limit cycle for the three-boson system. In addition, even though the diagrams involving in the two renormalization methods are different, we obtained the same curves of for SM and AM.  In Fig.  , we plot curves of first and second binding energies, and , which appear due to the limit cycle in the amplitudes and and the dressed vertex function , as functions of .  Because the first binding energy appearing in the amplitude is used as input for renormalization in SM, we have a horizontal line which corresponds to  MeV. A curve of second binding energy,  GeV, in the amplitude appears almost flat and starts around  MeV. One can expect that such a deep binding energy will not affect physics at low energies. Meanwhile, one may be concerned that the system can decay into the deeply bound state once it is formed. Thus one may choose an upper limit of the cutoff value less than  GeV for the present system.  In AM, the position of the binding energy is reproduced in the propagator due to the renormalization, whereas bound states are created in the other parts, and , of the amplitude due to the limit cycle. First binding energy in and starts appearing around  MeV. The binding energy at the starting point is just above the two-body binding energy,  MeV, and it increases as the cutoff value increases. Second binding energy in and starts appearing around  MeV and similarly behaves to the first binding energy . At the point where the second binding energy appears the first binding energy becomes  MeV. Thus and contain the small binding energies at the wide range of the cutoff value, -10000 MeV in the figure, and one may expect that those quantities are quite sensitive to the cutoff .">

  <outline text="Scattering length of -wave boson-diboson scattering" _note="Scattering length of -wave boson-diboson scattering is calculated by using a formula , a\_3 = - T(0), where the scattering matrix is given as , with , and the wavefunction normalization factor of the diboson field has been presented in Eq. ( ). The on-shell amplitude is calculated by solving the integral equation in Eq. ( ) for SM, and that is given in Eq. ( ) for AM.  In Fig.  , curves of the scattering length for the renormalization methods SM and AM are plotted as functions of the cutoff . Curves of from each component of the amplitudes and in Eq. ( ) for AM are also included in the figure. We find the same curve of for SM and AM. It is natural because the diagrams of the scattering amplitude as well as the values of are the same for SM and AM. As seen in the figure, at small cutoff values are positive. As the value of the cutoff increases, the value of decreases. And when the value of becomes larger than about  MeV, converges to  fm. The behavior of at the small cutoff values implies an artificial effect that an important part of the momentum flow in the loops is missing at such small cutoff values . For AM, a contribution from each of the components and in Eq. ( ), as discussed in the previous subsection, is sensitive to the cutoff and exhibits the limit cycle. But after they are added together, one can obtain the cutoff-independent result at  MeV.">

  <outline text="Normalized wavefunctions" _note="In SM, a wavefunction for relative boson-diboson part of the three-boson bound state is calculated by solving the homogeneous part of the integral equation in Eq. ( ). Because the kernel of the integral equation depends on the energy, a normalization condition of the wavefunction becomes nontrivial . For a wavefunction , which satisfies an equation , one has a normalization condition of the wavefunction as  |D ( D\^[-1]{} - K ) D|= 1, where . In our case, the operators and are realized as in Eq. ( ), and K K(p,l;E) = ( ), and thus we have a normalization condition of the wavefunction as &amp;&amp; \^\_0 dll\^2 ( )\^2\ &amp;&amp; - \^\_0 dl’l’\^2 \^\_0 dll\^2\ &amp;&amp; = 1, where is a wavefunction of the bound state obtained in SM.  A normalized wavefunction is obtained from the dressed vertex function for AM as  \_[A]{}(p) = -Y\_t(p,-B\_3),   where we have included an overall minus sign in the expression above so as to obtain a positive value of the wavefunction at . is the wavefunction normalization factor of the dressed triboson field and is obtained from the propagator in Eq. ( ). Thus one has Z\_t = - , where . We note that the wavefunction does not depend on , which is used for normalization in Eq. ( ). In addition, does not depend on either because the coupling is cancelled between those in the vertex and the normalization factor . Thus one cannot make the wavefunction cutoff independence by adjusting the parameters, and . Furthermore, a part of the amplitude, , which exhibits a limit cycle and generates bound states in it, is not included in the calculation of . It might be interesting to examine if the wavefunction can be cutoff-independence (in other words, if the limit cycle in can be cancelled with that in the wavefunction normalization factor ) along with whether is the identical to or not.  In Figs.   and  , we plot curves of the dressed vertex function and those of normalized wavefunctions , respectively, as functions of relative momentum using various cutoff values from 300 to 3000 MeV for AM where we have used  MeV for .  As seen in Fig.  , overall factors of the curves of show a cutoff-dependence, whereas one can see in Fig.   that the cutoff dependence in the overall factor of disappears in the normalized wavefunction . On the other hand, the normalized wavefunction for SM, , is indeed cutoff-independent because of the renormalization. We find the same -dependence of the normalized wavefunctions for SM and AM and a difference in the overall factors between them (we do not show a figure for ). The factor difference is about 2.36, and we have .">

<outline text="Discussion and conclusions" _note="In the present work, we have studied the auxiliary field renormalization method suggested by Hagen et al. employing a three-boson system with a triboson field. We numerically calculated the coupling of the three-body contact interaction for renormalization, the scattering length of -wave boson-diboson scattering, and the normalized wavefunctions as functions of the cutoff employing the two renormalization methods, SM and AM. We confirm that the three-body system exhibits a limit cycle, and the cyclic singularity can be renormalized by using the both methods. Though the different diagrams are involved for renormalization in those two methods, we obtained the identical result for the renormalized coupling constant of the three-body contact interaction as well as the scattering length . In addition, we find that the normalized wavefunctions turned out to be cutoff independent, however, we obtained the different overall factors of the normalized wavefunctions in the two methods.  It may be interesting to point out that even though the detailed diagrams involving in the two renormalization methods and the calculation methods are different, the results of the renormalization of the coupling constants turned out to be the same. Thus, because the diagrams for the scattering amplitude and the renormalized coupling are the same for SM and AM, it is natural to obtain the same scattering length , in which the limit cycle is renormalized, for the both methods. On the other hand, the parts of the scattering lengths , and , for AM are indeed sensitive to the cutoff and exhibit the limit cycle.  For the normalized wavefunction , it is also interesting to point out that it is not necessary to renormalize and fix the parameter in the dressed triboson propagator . As mentioned above, the two normalized wavefunctions, and , are obtained from the different diagrams and the different calculation methods, while and turned out to be the same function of except for the overall factors. Nevertheless, one would have a same result of a physical observable, e.g., electric form factor, in the both renormalization methods after normalizing the wavefunctions by using an available conservative quantity such as a baryon number or an electric charge.
