    <title>Classification of plethories in characteristic zero</title>
    <abstract>We classify plethories over fields of characteristic zero, thus
answering a question of Borger-Wieland and Bergman. All plethories over
characteristic zero fields are linear, in the sense that they are free
plethories on a bialgebra. For the proof we need some facts from the
theory of ring schemes where we extend previously known results. We also
classify plethories with trivial Verschiebung over a perfect field of
non-zero characteristic and indicate future work. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Plethories, first introduced by Tall-Wraith , and then studied by Borger-Wieland , are precisely the objects which act on -algebras, for a commutative ring. There are many fundamental questions regarding plethories which remain unanswered. One such question is, given a ring whether one can classify plethories over in this paper we will take a first step towards a classification.\ For some motivation, let us start by looking at the category of modules over a commutative ring If we consider the category of representable functors there is a monoidal structure given by composition of functors. Then one defines a -algebra as a -module together with a comonad structure on the representable endofunctor with respect to composition of functors. Heuristically, this says that a -algebra is precisely the kind of object which knows how to act on -modules. This can be extended to a non-linear setting, so that instead of looking at -modules we look at -algebras and consider representable endofunctors A comonoid with respect to composition of functors is then called a plethory and analogously, a plethory is what knows how to act on -algebras. One particular important example of a plethory is the -algebra which consist of the ring of symmetric functions in infinitely many variables with a certain biring structure. The functor represents the functor taking a ring to its ring of Witt vectors. Using plethories one gets a very conceptual view of Witt vectors and in James Borger develops the geometry of Witt vectors using the plethystic perspective.\ Let now be a field. If we let denote the category of plethories over there is a forgetful functor into the category of cocommutative counital bialgebras over This functor has a left adjoint and we say that a plethory is linear if for some cocommutative, counital bialgebra Heuristically, a plethory is linear if every action of on an algebra comes from an action of a bialgebra on The main theorem of this paper is:  Let be a field of characteristic zero. Then any -plethory is linear.  This answers a question of Bergman-Hausknecht and Borger-Wieland in the positive. The theorem is proved by studying the category of affine ring schemes. We have the following results, extending those of Greenberg to arbitrary fields and not necesarily reduced schemes:  Let be a field. Then any connected ring scheme of finite type is unipotent.  Let be a connected ring scheme of finite type over Then is affine.  For the case of characteristic our classification results on plethories are not as complete and further work is needed to have a complete classification. To explain our classification results here we need some definitions. Let be the Frobenius homomorphism of and be the non-commutative ring which as underlying set is and has multiplication given by and We define to be the category of cocommutative, counital bialgebras over which also are modules over Once again, for a plethory over a perfect field of char there is a forgetful functor which has a left adjoint Call a plethory -linear if for some We have then the following classification result:  Let be a perfect field of characteristic Assume that is a plethory over such that the Verschiebung Then is -linear.  The structure of this paper is as follows. In section we study ring schemes and prove some results which we will need for our classification theorem. The main theorems of this section that are needed for later purposes are Theorem   and Theorem  . In section we introduce plethories and -birings and provide some examples. This section contains no new results and gives just a brief introduction to the relevant objects as defined in Borger-Wieland . In section we prove that all plethories over a field of characteristic zero is linear using the results from section We also show that any -biring is connected. In section we prove some initial classification results regarding plethories in characteristic">

<outline text="Ring schemes" _note="Let be a commutative ring. Recall that is a ring scheme over if is a scheme together with a lift of the functor to We say that a ring scheme is a -algebra scheme if the lift factors through the category of -algebras. We will mostly be concerned with affine ring schemes. Ring schemes were studied by Greenberg in and he showed that for connected, reduced ring schemes of finite type over an algebraically closed field the underlying scheme is always affine. Further, he shows that the underlying group variety is always unipotent. We improve on these results by showing that any connected ring schemes of finite type over an arbitrary field is affine, and that the underlying group scheme is always unipotent. From now on, in this section, is always a field.  A -scheme is anti-affine if We say that a group scheme is anti-affine if its underlying scheme is anti-affine  For example, abelian varieties are all anti-affine group schemes. An anti-affine group scheme has the property that any morphism from it into an affine group scheme is trivial. Anti-affine groups are very important for the structure of group schemes as the following theorem shows:      If is a group scheme of finite type over a field there is an exact sequence of group schemes such that is anti-affine and is affine.  We will now want to show that all connected finite type ring schemes are affine, i.e that in the above exact sequence For this, we will need the following lemma.  Let be -schemes with quasi-compact and anti-affine and locally noetherian and irreducible.Suppose that is a morphism such that there exist k-rational points such that for all Then for all  see .    Let be a connected ring scheme of finite type over Then is affine.  We know by Theorem   that sits in the middle of an extension of an affine group scheme by an anti-affine group. Let be the corresponding extension where is anti-affine and the affine quotient. Since is of finite type, is a ring scheme. This follows from the fact that if are quasi-compact -schemes, then the obvious map is an isomorphism (see ). This implies that defines an ideal scheme in i.e for all rings over is an ideal of Now, we will apply the above lemma with (note that is irreducible) and Taking and to be the rational points corresponding to the additive identity of and respectively, we have that is identically equal to zero. Thus, we have that is identically zero. But, letting be the rational point corresponding to the multiplicative identity of we have that is zero. But multiplication by is always injective, and thus, is trivial and is affine.  We don’t know if the condition for to be of finite type is necessary in  . Let us recall the following definition from the theory of algebraic groups.  Let be a commutative group scheme over . We say that is unipotent if it is affine and if every non-zero closed subgroup of admits a non-zero homomorphism  The data of a homomorphism is the same as specifying an element in the underlying Hopf algebra of that satisfies i.e specifying a primitive element. If is an affine group scheme and the Hopf algebra associated to then saying that is unipotent is the same as saying that it is coconnected (or conilpotent). The following definition will be useful for the proof of Theorem  .  Let be a commutative affine group scheme over a field. We say that is multiplicative if every homomorphism is zero.  An example of a multiplicative group is There can in general be no homomorphism from a multiplicative group into a unipotent group and no morphisms from a unipotent group to a multiplicative group (for a proof, see ).\ The following theorem was shown for reduced ring varieties over an algebraically closed fields by Greenberg, but the results carry over for perfect fields without any modification. We improve on this by carrying through the proof when is not necesarily reduced and over any field . Further,the theorem can be extended to ring schemes not necesarily of finite type if the ring scheme is already known to be affine.    Over a field all connected ring schemes of finite type are unipotent.  By Theorem  , a connected ring scheme is affine. We know that contains a greatest multiplicative subgroup that has the property that for all endomorphisms of (where is the base change of to ) for a -algebra, that (). Thus, since any defines an endomorphism of (as a group scheme) through multiplication by we have that is an ideal of It is known that any action of a connected algebraic group on a multiplicative group must be trivial, i.e for connected and multiplicative, a map must have image the identity. We will need the following, which says that any map where is any connected group scheme and is multiplicative is trivial. This is basically just deduced, mutatis mutandis, from the proof of . So, we see that and defines the same endomorphisms on the ideal scheme But this is only the case if  To extend this to all connected ring schemes, we need the following:    Let be a field and be an affine ring scheme over Then is a filtered limit of ring schemes of finite type.  The following proof is inspired by the analogue theorem for Hopf algebras over a field, as occurs in for example Milne . Write We know that is a bialgebra and we see that we can reduce to proving that any is contained in a sub-bialgebra of finite type. Let be the coaddition giving the additive group structure on and the comultiplication defining the multiplication on Consider with and linearly independent. Now, by the fundamental theorem of coalgebras, we know that if we take to be the subspace of generated by then this is a subcoalgebra, i.e that Now, for each in this system, consider with and linearly independent. With the same arguments, one sees that for the subspace generated by we have Let now be subalgebra generated by the finite-dimensional subspace spanned by We claim that actually is closed under both the operation and It is clear that and the same holds for coaddition. It is also easy to verify that We will now prove that and for this, consider the following diagram which is easily verified if we reverse all arrows and think of it in terms of rings.\  A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\ A\_ A\_ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\ A\_ A\_ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_\ A\_ (A\_ A\_) (A\_ A\_) A \_ &amp; A\_ A\_\ (A\_ A\_) A\_ A\_ (A\_ A\_) &amp; (A\_ A\_) A\_\ A\_ A\_ A\_ A\_ &amp; A\_ A\_ A\_ A  \ \ Here is the multiplication map and swithces the factors. What the diagram is saying, is just relating different ways of forming for in a ring. So this says, that Now, since are independent, this means that and by linear independence of each this means that Now, let be the sub-algebra generated by where is the antipode. It is easily verified that and that follows from the identity We thus see that is a bialgebra and we are done.  Any affine connected ring scheme over a field is unipotent.  Indeed, we know that we can write where ranges over ring schemes of finite type. Now, unipotence is stable under inverse limits and this immediately gives that is unipotent.">

Consider now the constant group scheme Then we can define a structure of a ring scheme on by defining the multiplication to be for This is a non-reduced ring scheme.  A famous example is also that the functor taking a ring to its ring of big Witt vectors, is also representable by a ring scheme.\ Let us note that we can form the category of -birings, with morphisms between objects those morphism of -algebras respecting the biring structure. We let be the category of -birings. Let us recall the following definition from .  Let be a -biring.

Indeed, we have that and since the latter set has a ring structure, so does the former. One then verifies that gives a monoidal structure to The unit of this monoidal structure is is a monoidal category, but it is not symmetric. Now, the Yoneda embedding sets up an equivalence of categories between the category of representable endofunctors and and under this equivalence, corresponds to composition of representable endofunctors as given in the introduction. Denote the category of representable endofunctors by  A -plethory is a comonoid in where the monoidal structure is composition of endofunctors. Explicitly, on the level of representing objects, a -plethory is a monoid in This means that is a biring together with an associative map of birings and a unit     For a plethory one can define an action of on a -ring to be a map such that and A ring together with an action of on is called a -ring.

<outline text="Classification of plethories over a field of characteristic zero." _note="In this section we will prove that all plethories over a field of characteristic zero are linear. This question was asked by Bergman-Hausknecht and Borger-Wieland . To understand what it means for a plethory to be linear, we will introduce some terminology.  Let be a cocommutative bialgebra (not necesarily commutative) over with comultiplication Then there is a free -plethory on over The underlying algebra structure is the symmetric algebra on and the coaddition is induced from the map sending to The comultiplication is similarily induced from The plethysm is given by where is the multiplication on Among the pairs consisting of a plethory and a morphism of bialgebras the pair and is initial with this property.  Call a plethory linear if for some bialgebra The reason for calling it linear is that if for some bialgebra then Let us note now that by Theorem   any connected ring scheme of finite type is unipotent. Over (or more generally any field of characteristic zero) all group schemes are reduced by a theorem of Cartier. We say that a group scheme is étale if is a finite scheme and geometrically reduced. This is equivalent to asking for the underlying Hopf algebra to be an étale algebra. Let us recall the following definition from the theory of group schemes (see for example or )  Let be a group scheme of finite type over Let be the underlying Hopf algebra of and consider the largest étale k-subalgebra of then has a Hopf algebra structure induced from the one on and we let be the group scheme associated to this Hopf algebra.  Note that there is a canonical map It is easy to see that if then is geometrically connected since in that case has no nontrivial idempotents.  Any -algebra scheme of finite type over any infinite field is geometrically connected.  Consider the connected-étale exact sequence of group schemes where is the identity component of We will first show that has a natural -algebra scheme structure. Indeed, for this it is enough to show that is a -ideal scheme in . Let us start by proving that We know that the multiplication takes the additive identity to itself, i.e for any Further, the -algebra structure on is induced from the -algebra structure on This clearly implies that is a -ideal scheme. Thus, the quotient is a -algebra scheme. Let us see that is isomorphic to One knows that the underlying algebra of is a product of finite separable -extensions. We consider this is a -algebra (since is a ring scheme). Because the underlying algebra of is a finite product of finite separable field extensions, is a finite set. However, for a finite set to have a -algebra structure it must just contain one element, i.e it has to be the zero ring. This implies that so is geometrically connected.  Now, let us consider a Hopf algebra and denote the primitive elements of by We say that a Hopf algebra is primitively generated if generates as an algebra. Over characteristic zero all unipotent affine group schemes are primitively generated. We then have the classical Milnor-Moore theorem .  For any commutative connected affine unipotent group scheme over a field of characteristic zero, the canonical map is an isomorphism of group schemes. In particular, the underlying scheme is affine space.  Let us note that we can view as a Lie algebra with trivial commutator. Then the construction is the same as the universal enveloping Lie algebra of  In it is shown that if is a plethory over a field , then the primitives with respect to is a cocommutative -bialgebra. Briefly, the multiplication in is given by the plethysm and the maps induces a comultiplication respectively a counit on making it a cocommutative counital bialgebra.  Let be a plethory over a field of characteristic zero . Then is linear, i.e where has the plethory structure as given in Definition 3.1.  Suppose that is a plethory over . naturally has a bialgebra structure as explained above. Given this, we can form the free plethory on We always have a natural map of Hopf algebras, and this is bijective by Milnor-Moore. Thus to show that any plethory is linear, it suffices to show that this is actually a morphism of plethories. But this is clear: the pair and is initial in the category of pairs consisting of a plethory and a morphism of bialgebras. It is immediate that the canonical map is induced by this universal property, when we note that there clearly is a map of bialgebras. We will of course need to show that is an isomorphism in the category of plethories. This follows easily from the fact that is an isomorphism of affine schemes and thus has an inverse in the category of affine schemes. What remains to be checked is that this inverse is a morphism of plethories, but this is immediate since is.  Let be a field of characteristic zero. Then the category of plethories over is equivalent to the category of cocommutative -bialgebras.  By the above theorem, the counit map is an isomorphism and it is immediate to see that the unit map is an isomorphism as well.  If is a field of characteristic zero and a plethory over this shows that the category of -rings is equivalent to the category of rings with an action of the bialgebra">

<outline text="Some classification results in characteristic" _note="In this section we will start a classification for plethories over a perfect field of characteristic Our classification results here only apply to a certain class of plethories. We state future research directions, as well as give some ”pathological” examples which a complete classification must take into account. For any scheme over with structure map we let be the pullback of along the Frobenius.\ \ Let us briefly recall that for perfect fields group schemes over have two especially important maps, the (relative) Frobenius and the Verschiebung These satisfy the property that A ring scheme is called elementary unipotent if i.e the Verschiebung is zero. Call a plethory weakly linear if there is a map of plethories where is a linear plethory (as defined in the previous section) such that when viewed as a map of algebras is surjective. This will, in particular, imply that is primitively generated and is a quotient of by a -ideal as defined in . Not all plethories over a perfect field are primitively generated, as the following example shows (built on an example from , Remark 1.6.2).  Let be the group scheme which as a scheme, is just We let the the group structure be given by for where This is a -torsion group scheme but is not elementary unipotent. One can define a non-unital ring scheme structure on be definining the multiplication to be trivial and then, when is finte, i.e ”unitalize” this by taking the direct product with to get a ring scheme, as we did in Example 3.3. The underlying group scheme of this ring scheme is clearly not elementary unipotent, since the Verschiebung acts on each factor separately. Taking the free plethory on a biring (see 2.1 ) will then give us a plethory with its underlying group scheme not elementary unipotent.  Another feature which differs from the case over a field of characteristic zero is that there are plethories which have a non-trivial multiplicative subgroups. This stems from the fact that there are ring schemes with non-trivial multiplicative subgroups.  Consider with comultiplication and counit This is an example of a multiplicative group scheme which is p-torsion and we can as before define a trivial multiplication on making it a non-unital ring scheme. We can then as previously stated, for finite fields, unitalize it to get a ring scheme by taking the direct product with and after that we can form the free plethory to get a plethory with a non-trivial multiplicative subgroup.The fact that it has a non-trivial multiplicative subgroup comes from , for example, the fact that there is a non-zero homomorphism of group schemes  These two examples are rather artificial, but they show that plethories behave wildly different in characteristic than in characteristic We know that for any group scheme over a perfect field of characteristic the group of primitive elements has a natural action of the Frobenius, taking to In fact, becomes a module over a certain ring. As we previously stated, We thus have that is naturally a module over the endomorphism ring  Let be the non-commutative polynomial ring over in one variable with multplication given by, for where is the Frobenius endomorphism of  It is a quick calculation to show that We now see that is a module over Let us denote the category of modules over by Given a -module one can construct an elementary unipotent group scheme as follows (for details we refer the reader to ) . Form the symmetric algebra on with its obvious Hopf algebra structure and consider the map We then quotient out by the ideal generated by the elements to get One notes that for any commutative algebraic group one always has a map We have the following classical theorem (see )  Let be an affine group scheme. The following are equivalent:\ (i) The Verschiebung is zero.\ (ii) is a closed subgroup of for some \ (iii) The canonical homomorphism is an isomorphism.  What we call is the same as the enveloping -algebra (also called the restricted universal enveloping algebra) on the -Lie algebra where has trivial commutator.  When is a plethory, then has the structure of a plethory.  We know that has a module structure where the action of is just taking the th power. Further, is the quotient of which we know is a plethory, by the ideal generated by , where is the inclusion in degree It now suffices to show that this is a -ideal (see 6.1) for to be a plethory. This is equivalent to showing that for a generating set of that and and that The first is immediate, since taking to be the set of all we have which is equal to Further, and this is equal to but this is in We also need to show that this is clear. The last containment is similarily easy to verify.  When is a plethory over a perfect field such that then We then say that is a -linear plethory.  All one has to verify is that the canonical map is a map of plethories. But this is obvious since this map is just the composition of the two plethory maps and  We have seen that plethories need not be elementary unipotent and not purely unipotent either (i.e it can have a non-trivial multiplicative subgroup) Let us note that there can be no non-trivial finite plethories over an infinite perfect field Indeed, from what we have seen all plethories are connected over an infinite field. By classical Dieudonné theory we can then decompose as This would imply that the Frobenius is nilpotent, but this can never happen: the Frobenius is always a map of ring schemes.  It seems to us that to classify plethories over a perfect field one should establish an extension of ordinary Dieudonné theory to account for ring schemes, which has been done to some extent by Hedayatzadeh in and for Hopf rings by Goerss and Buchstaber-Lazarev . Note that Hedayatzadeh work with finite / profinite group schemes and with local group schemes, which limits their applications to ring schemes since we have seen that there are no non-trivial finite connected ring schemes over a perfect field.">
