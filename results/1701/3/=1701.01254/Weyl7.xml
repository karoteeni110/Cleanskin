    <title>The heat trace for the drifting Laplacian and Schrödinger operators on
manifolds</title>
    <abstract>We study the heat trace for both the drifting Laplacian as well as
Schrödinger operators on compact Riemannian manifolds. In the case of a
finite regularity potential or weight function, we prove the existence
of a partial (six term) asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for small
times as well as a suitable remainder estimate. We also demonstrate that
the more precise asymptotic behavior of the remainder is determined by
and conversely distinguishes higher (Sobolev) regularity on the
potential or weight function. In the case of a smooth weight function,
we determine the full asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for the
drifting Laplacian for small times. We then use the heat trace to study
the asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function. In both cases the
Weyl law coincides with the Weyl law for the Riemannian manifold with
the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator. We conclude by demonstrating
isospectrality results for the drifting Laplacian on compact manifolds. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Heat equation methods are incredibly useful; see for example, [THE UBIQUITOUS HEAT KERNEL]{}, . One of the most standard ways to prove the spectral theorem for the Laplace operator on a Riemannian manifold is via the associated heat semi-group. Moreover, the heat equation provides a connection between probability theory and analysis. As noted in Kac’s famous paper, one can thereby demonstrate analytical results using probabilistic methods . More recently, van den Berg and Srisatkunarajah used probabilistic methods to demonstrate results for the short time asymptotic behavior of the heat trace on polygonal domains .  The heat trace of a Schrödinger operator over a manifold reflects many of the geometric quantities of the manifold intertwined with the potential term. It is also used to determined the rate at which the eigenvalues of the operator tend to infinity. In this article we focus on short time asymptotic expansions of the heat trace for Schrödinger operators on manifolds with an irregular potential, as well as the short time asymptotic expansions of the heat trace for drifting Laplacians on weighted manifolds.  To be more precise, we consider , a smooth, compact, Riemannian manifold of dimension . The Laplace operator, , is determined by the Riemannian metric, with In this article, we will consider the Schrödinger operator, where the potential satisfies . We also consider the drifting Laplacian, Above, we assume that is a function on which satisfies and . The operator is also known as the weighted Laplacian or Bakry-Émery Laplacian. The Schrödinger operator is a self-adjoint operator which maps . The drifting Laplacian is also a self-adjoint operator with respect to the weighted volume measure where is the volume measure given by the Riemannian metric.  Our first result is the existence of a small time asymptotic expansion for the trace of the heat kernels associated to . We determine the first few coefficients in this expansion as well as a remainder estimate of order whenever the potential is in . Let denote the heat semigroup for the operator , and denote the heat semigroup for the operator . We note that the operator is a self-adjoint operator which maps .   Let be a smooth, compact, Riemannian manifold of dimension . Let . Then is trace class and has a short time asymptotic expansion as given by where denotes the scalar curvature of , and is the coefficient of in the short time asymptotic expansion of given in .  We prove Proposition   in Section  . In Corollary   we will see that that a similar expansion also holds for whenever .  Recall that the spectrum, , of a self adjoint operator on a Hilbert space consists of all points such that fails to be invertible. Using classical functional analytic techniques one can show that the operators, and , only have discrete spectrum. In other words, for or , consists only of eigenvalues such that there exists an element in the domain of the operator, , satisfying Moreover, these eigenvalues only accumulate at infinity. An immediate consequence of the existence of a short-time asymptotic expansion is Weyl’s law for the growth rate of its eigenvalues.    Let be a compact, smooth, -dimensional Riemannian manifold with Laplace operator, . Let . Let denote the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger operator, with . For a function on with let denote the eigenvalues of the drifting Laplacian with . Let Then where above denotes the volume of with respect to the Riemannian metric , and denotes the volume of the unit ball in .  As one readily sees from the above result, Weyl’s law for the drifting Laplacian is in fact independent of the weight function , whenever and are in . In fact, Weyl’s law only depends on the dimension of the manifold and its Riemannian volume. Although some experts provide (without proof) the correct Weyl law in the case (see for example p. 640 of ) it also often appears in literature (also without proof) with the weighted volume of the manifold. We anticipate that our paper will not only clarify this inconsistency, but also provide a more general setting in which the result is true. We prove Corollary   in §  using the the short time asymptotic behavior of the heat trace together with the Karamata Lemma.  The independence of Weyl’s law from the weight function for the drifting Laplacian comes in contrast to estimates for its eigevalues, which [DO ]{} depend on the weight function. For example in , A. Hassennezhad demonstrates upper bounds for and hence , under the assumption that is continuous. J.-Y. Wu and P. Wu demonstrate lower bounds for the eigenvalues of under the assumption that the -Ricci curvature is bounded below . Their estimates depend on lower bounds for the Bakry-Émery Ricci tensor, hence they also rely on being a function. As a result, one would also not anticipate that a Weyl’s law would hold for such general as in Corollary  , nor that it would be independent of . Our work complements the upper and lower eigenvalue estimates obtained by other authors and it may be useful to combine it with those results to obtain sharper eigenvalue estimates.  We will show in Section §  that the remainder estimate in the asymptotic expansion given in Proposition   is determined by, and conversely it also distinguishes the regularity of the potential function.    Assume . Then the heat trace has an asymptotic expansion as of the form if and only if .  This regularity result was inspired by the work of H. Smith and M. Zworski for Schrödinger operators on .    Assume and that the Schrödinger operators are isospectral. Then the potential, , is in if and only if is in .  In the case that is smooth, we compute in Section   the full small time asymptotic expansion expansion of the heat trace associated to , .    For a smooth weight function , has the short time asymptotic expansion where the are defined by .  If is the spectrum of the drifting Laplacian , then where We emphasize that the integral on the right side is taken with respect to the Riemannian volume form .  Finally, we give isospectrality results for the drifting Laplacian on compact manifolds.    Consider two weighted manifold and , with as in Corollary   on the respective manifolds. Suppose that the drifting Laplacian on and the drifting Laplacian on are isospectral. Then the two manifolds must have the same dimension and the same Riemannian volume.  If in addition and are orientable surfaces, and the two weight functions have equal Dirichlet norms, then they are diffeomorphic.  If is of dimension , then the set of isospectral drifting Laplacians, , with smooth , is compact in .">

  <outline text="Heat trace for a Schrödinger operator with an  potentials" _note="In this subsection will prove Proposition  . Recall that be a smooth, compact, Riemannian manifold of dimension and is a Schrödinger operator with .  The estimates of §3 p. 465, show that the semigroup is trace class, but since their results are over , we recall the required calculations and estimates in the setting of a compact Riemannian manifold. Using Duhamel’s principle, one can generate an expression for which is given by with We first observe that we have the operator norm bound since the integrand is bounded by , and the volume of integration is . Then, we also have a bound on the trace class norm, This follows immediately by the same arguments given on p. 365 of . In fact, the proof can be simplified in our case: since we are working on a compact manifold, there is no need to use a cut-off function , and we can obtain the estimate directly by applying the operator . Consequently, the operator is trace class, and the trace may be exchanged with summation to get We will compute the trace of the first term, . Let denote the heat kernel of the semigroup . The Schwartz kernel of is given by where to simplify notation, we have used to indicate . To compute its trace, we set and integrate, Since we are on a compact manifold, the Laplacian has an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalues . Its heat kernel then has a simple expression with respect to this basis Expressing the heat kernels in in terms of this orthonormal basis and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions, we compute the integral with respect to to arrive at  Next, we use the fact that the heat kernel has a local expansion along the diagonal as and is the scalar curvature of (see for example \*[Chapter 3]{}). Since and is compact, it then follows that as  In fact, we can also compute the full asymptotic expansion of the term as . Recalling the identity for and applying the local heat trace expansion of together with the assumption that , we obtain The functions are the local heat invariants of the heat kernel on the Riemannian manifold . Consequently, the are [INDEPENDENT OF ]{} . It is in general very difficult to express these functions in terms of geometric and topological invariants of the manifold. We refer the interested reader to Rosenberg’s results in , and perhaps more conveniently to equation for an integral expression of the . In the case , as we have mentioned above, where is the scalar curvature of the manifold . We would also like to remark that in the expansion of the trace of only appears and none of its higher order derivatives.  To complete the proof, we continue to analyze the next term in the expansion. By definition , the trace of is We again use the orthonormal basis expansion to express and , and integrate with respect to to obtain  We can now apply a clever time-substitution technique to further simplify this expression (see for example \*[pp. 467–468]{}). Letting and suppressing the integrals over space we get Setting , and observing that , we have where for the last integration we have used that the integrand is independent of . Moreover, the symmetry of the last integral with respect to the map , further simplifies it to  Let be a small -neighborhood of the diagonal, in . By the rapid off-diagonal decay and the short time local asymptotic expansion for the two heat kernels and (see §3 of ), where depends on .  We now compare the short time asymptotic expansion of the product to Due to the off-diagonal decay it suffices to compare and for , recalling that . Since is smooth and is compact, for any , there exists such that and therefore  By the heat kernel expansion, We also know that for , the right side is rapidly decaying as . Moreover, for any , choosing a small enough -neighborhood (depending on ) we can make the right side above as small as desired by . Consequently, we get the appoximation  Note that is the solution to the heat equation with initial data at time . By we have  We recall that the solution to the heat equation with initial data at time converges to as , uniformly in for all . In other words, and as a result, However, we do not know a priori the [RATE]{} at which the right side converges as . Combining this estimate with we therefore obtain  To complete the proof, we recall the bound in , which shows that As a result, under the very general assumption that , we have a precise expression for the heat trace up to order and a remainder estimate, as  We note that the first, second, and fourth terms come from the corresponding terms in the short time heat trace expansion of on . Moreover, the potential does not appear in the leading order asymptotics; it first makes an appearance in the coefficient of . This is the crux of the matter and the reason why does not affect Weyl’s law for a Schrödinger operator. However, based on the work of Hassanezhad and Wu and Wu , one [DOES ]{} expect that more refined estimates of the eigenvalues of a Schrödinger operator may indeed depend on the potential.">

  <outline text="Weyl’s law via the heat trace and Karamata Lemma" _note="In general, there are two main techniques which can be used to prove Weyl’s law. The first technique is known as [DIRICHLET-NEUMANN BRACKETING]{}, and this is one used in Weyl’s classical proof . The second technique uses an element of the functional calculus of the Laplacian, such as the resolvent, wave group, or heat semi-group, together with a suitable Tauberian theorem. Here, we use the short time asymptotic behavior of the heat trace together with Karamata’s Tauberian Lemma to prove Corollary  .    Assume is a non-negative measure on , and . Assume that and Then for all continuous functions on we have  The relationship between the short time asymptotic behavior of the heat kernel together with the large asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue counting function via Karamata’s Lemma is not completely obvious. To explicate this, we recall that a natural way to relate the heat trace to the counting function is by introducing the spectral measure, , with With respect to this measure, the heat trace can be written as From this perspective, the existence of a one-term asymptotic expansion together with a remainder estimate for the heat trace as is precisely the statement that there exists , and a constant with  Next, one would like to connect the above assumption to the counting function asymptotics as the spectral parameter tends to infinity. To do this, consider a function, , which is equal to on some compact subset of and suitably cut-off. Then, one has This calculation gives some hope that perhaps with a clever choice of the function , one can use ( ) and the preceding equation to demonstrate Weyl’s law. It is then natural to investigate the existence of for a suitably general class of functions . We hope that these insights demystify Karamata’s seemingly magical result.  We shall apply the Karamata Lemma to a function which does not in fact satisfy the hypotheses of the Lemma. For the sake of completeness, we shall therefore prove a slight generalization of Karamata’s Lemma.    Let be a bounded, non-negative, piecewise continuous function on . Assume that is a non-negative measure, , and Then, we have  We begin by introducing the notations  Let be a sequence of continuous functions such that and Because is non-negative and bounded, we have the estimate This will allow us to apply dominated convergence arguments.  Since each is continuous, Moreover, under these assumptions, Therefore, so letting , we have On the other hand, We therefore obtain  As usual, we assume that is a compact Riemannian manifold, and . Let be the spectrum of the Schrödinger operator, , on . We shall apply the Karamata Lemma with the measure Then we note that Above, is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Schrödinger operator. It is well known that is finite whenever the potential is bounded below. For the sake of completeness, however, we will provide the brief argument for this fact here. Let be the unitary eigenfunction corresponding to such that and . First we note that Since we have The second term above is fixed, and the first term is positive for all non-constant eigenfunctions. The spectral theorem in this setting implies that the eigenvalues may only accumulate at . By the above estimate, the eigenvalues may only accumulate at , and there are at most finitely many negative eigenvalues.  We shall apply Lemma   to the function,  Observe that , . On the other hand . Therefore, for ,  By Proposition  , This follows from the fact that the sum over the negative eigenvalues is a finite sum and therefore the factor of kills it as .  We therefore let Applying Karamata’s Lemma with the aforementioned , , and ,  By the computation  we have Above we have assumed . Thus which is equivalent to Since the proof of Weyl’s law for the operator is complete.  To prove Weyl’s law for the drifting Laplacian on a weighted manifold, we use the fact that is is unitarily equivalent to a Schrödinger operator. We consider a function on the manifold, , such that and are both in . Let denote the set of integrable functions on with respect to the weighted measure , . Using the transformation given by we have that the drifting Laplacian is unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger operator, Under these assumptions the potential function . Consequently, although these operators need not have the same eigenfunctions, they do have the same eigenvalues. In other words, for the above and , the operators and are isospectral. We therefore apply the preceding proof of Weyl’s law for the operator and conclude that the operator obeys the same Weyl law as .  It is straightforward to prove that Weyl’s law is equivalent to Equivalently, one has">

Finally, we use the proposition to prove Theorem  .

We proved in Proposition   that for we have an expansion for the heat trace of with an error term of order for small. Theorem   implies that if the error term is slightly better, then the potential must in fact belong to . The converse is also true. This regularity result was inspired by the work of H. Smith and M. Zworski for Schrödinger operators on . There the authors were able to use the Fourier transform on Euclidean space to express the trace of the heat kernel and relate it to the norms of the potential, but also to obtain estimates for the terms . In this article we provide a generalization of some of their results to the case of compact manifolds. In our case, we are not able to use the nice properties of the Fourier transform, but instead rely on the definition of the norm with respect to the heat operator, as well the expansion of the heat kernel with respect to its orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. We believe that similar results should also hold on non-compact manifolds where the drifting Laplacian has a discrete spectrum and its heat operator can be expressed using such an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. We were recently informed by H. Smith that he has also independently worked out a generalization of his results with M. Zworski for complete manifolds.    Let be a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold with Laplace operator , and let be a real-valued function on , such that Then, the heat kernel for drifting Laplacian has a small-time asymptotic expansion as of the form where the remainder as .

This is done via the parametrix method, as in the case of the Laplacian, and works particularly well for a smooth weight function . Since we are mainly interested in the coefficients for the short time asymptotic expansion of the heat trace we will omit some of the simply technical elements of the arguments as they are identical to the unweighted case (we will refer the interested reader to for the details).
