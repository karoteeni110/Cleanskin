<outline text="Conclusion" _note="This paper presents a matrix factorization based approach to text outlier analysis. The approach is designed to adjust well to the widely varying structures in different localities of the data, and therefore provides more robust methods than competing models. The approach has the potential to be applied to other domains with similar structure, and as a specific example, we provide experiments on market basket data. We also presented extensive experimental results, which illustrate the superiority of the approach. Our code can be downloaded from &lt;https://github.com/ramkikannan/outliernmf&gt; and tried with any text dataset.  In this paper, we had a parallel implementation using the Matlabâ€™s parallel computing toolbox to run in multicore environments. In the future, we would like to explore a scalable implementation of our algorithm. The solution is embarrassingly parallelizable, and would like to experiment in web scale data. One of the potential extension is incorporating temporal and spatial aspects into the model. Such an extension, make the solution applicable to emerging applications such as topic detection and streaming data. We experimented the solution primarily on text data and market basket data. In future work, we will extend this broader approach to other domains such as video data.">
