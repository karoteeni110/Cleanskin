<outline text="Related Work" _note="The outlier analysis problem has been studied extensively in the literature . Numerous algorithms have been proposed in the literature for outlier detection of conventional multidimensional data . The key methods, which are used frequently for outlier analysis include distance-based methods , density-based methods , and subspace methods . In distance-based methods, data points are declared outliers, when they are situated far away from the dense regions in the underlying data. Typically, indexing or other summarization schemes may be used in order to improve the efficiency of the approach. In density-based methods , data points with low local density with respect to the remaining points are declared outliers. In addition, a number of subspace methods have been proposed recently, in which outliers are defined on the basis of subspace behavior of the underlying data.  Most of the traditional multidimensional methods can also be extended to text data, though they are not particularly suited to the latter. Some methods have been designed for outlier detection with matrix factorization in network data sets , that are not applicable to text data. Text data is uniquely difficult because of its sparse and high dimensional nature. As a result, many of the outliers detected using conventional methods may simply correspond to noisy text segments. Therefore, careful modeling is required with the use of matrix factorization methods.  Over the last decade, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has emerged as another important low rank approximation technique, where the low-rank factor matrices are constrained to have only non-negative elements. Lee and Seung introduced a multiplicative update based low rank approximation with non-negative factors to overcome the challenges of truncated SVD. Subsequent to this work, NMF has received enormous attention and has been successfully applied to a broad range of important problems in areas including computer vision, community detection in social networks, visualization, recommender systems bioinformatics, etc. In spite of broad range of applications, NMF’s literature in text domain is scarce. Xu [ET. AL.]{} experimented with NMF for document clustering instead of SVD based Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Other than applications of NMF in the text domain, Gaussier and Goutte established the equivalence between NMF and pLSA. Similarly, Ding [ET. AL.]{} explained the equivalence between NMF and pLSI.  In this paper, we use an NMF approach for concise modelling of the patterns, the background, and the anomalies in the underlying data. It should be pointed out that NMF is similar to the generative models of text such as pLSI and LDA , though NMF often provides better interpretability. Our important challenge is to model the outliers along with the low rank space of the input matrix. We identified -norm as an appropriate approach for factorization in outlier analysis. Recently, the researchers have used -norm in their models to solve various problems, though the corresponding solution techniques are not easily generalizable to the -norm. Yang et.al., , under the assumption that the class label of input data can be predicted by a linear classifier, incorporate discriminative analysis and -norm minimization into a joint framework for unsupervised feature selection problem. Similarly, Liu [ET AL]{} , solve -norm regularized regression model for joint feature selection from multiple tasks. They also propose to use Nesterov’s method to solve the optimization problem with non-smooth -norm regularization. Also, Kong [ET AL]{} propose a robust formulation of NMF using -norm loss function for data with noises.">

<outline text="Our Contributions" _note="Text data is uniquely challenging to outlier detection both because of its sparsity and high dimensional nature. Given the relevant literature for NMF and text outliers, we propose the first approach to detect outliers in text data using non-negative matrix factorization. We extend the fact that NMF is similar to pLSI and LDA generative models and model the outliers using the -norm. This particular formulation of NMF is non-standard, and requires careful design of optimization methods to solve the problem. We solve the resulting optimization problem using block coordinate descent technique. We also present extensive experimental results both on text and other kinds of market basket data sets. We show significant improvements achieved by the approach over other baseline methods.">
