    <title>Entanglement witness game</title>
    <abstract>Motivated by Buscemi’s semi-quantum nonlocal game  , We propose an entanglement witness game, a quantum game based
on entanglement witness. Similar as the semi-quantum nonlocal game, the
existence of entanglement shared by the players is necessary and
sufficient for obtaining a positive average payoff in our entanglement
witness game. Two explicit examples are constructed to demonstrate how
to play our entanglement witness game and its relations with the CHSH
nonlocal game. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Entanglement is a useful resource in quantum information processes. For example, quantum teleportation is impossible without shared remote entanglement. What’s the property of entanglement makes it indispensable in these tasks? It is believed that entanglement has some intriguing nonlocality, which can be revealed by violating Bell inequalities based on local Hidden variables. In 1989, however, R.F. Werner discovered that there are some entanglement states satisfy all Bell inequalities, in other words, the correlations in these entangled states can be explained by the Hidden variable model.  Since Werner’s discovery, a lot of works aimed to explore the subtle differences between the nonlocality in entanglement and that revealed by violating Bell inequalities . For instance, the following problem is raised : are all the entangled states useful in quantum teleportation? This leads to the discovery of the concept of bound entanglement and the understanding of the role of entanglement played in quantum teleportation.  In another direction, the relation between nonlocal games and Bell inequalities is built: For any Bell inequality, we can build a nonlocal game which makes the states violating Bell inequality have a positive average payoff. According to Werner’s discovery, the entanglement states satisfying all Bell inequalities will not have a positive average payoff in any such type of nonlocal game. This makes F. Buscemi put forward a revised nonlocal game , called semi-quantum nonlocal game, in which the questions sent to the players are allowed to be represented by nonorthogonal quantum states. In the semi-quantum nonlocal game, any entangled state can obtain a positive average payoff while all the separable states can not.  In 2013, two groups realize that the semi-quantum nonlocal game can be used to be measurement-device-independent entanglement witness. In particular, it shows how to use any entanglement witness to design a semi-quantum nonlocal game .  Motivated by the semi-quantum nonlocal game, we propose a simpler quantum game based on entanglement witness, in which only classical communications between the referee and the players are allowed, and the target of our game is the same as: any entangled state can obtain higher payoff than all separable states.  Our paper is organized as follows. In section II we briefly review nonlocal game and semi-quantum nonlocal game . In section III, the main part of this paper, we propose our entanglement witness game, for simplicity, we only give the bipartite and tripartite scenario of our game, but our game can be easily extend to multipartite situations. In section IV, we give explicit two-qubit examples to show how to play our entanglement witness game, and it also reveals the relation of our entanglement witness game with the previous one. Finally, a summary is given.">

<outline text="Nonlocal game and Semi-quantum nonlocal game" _note="Before discussing our entanglement witness game, we review the procedures of nonlocal game and semi-quantum nonlocal game, which are shown in Fig.  .  In these two games, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and one referee. The referee sends two questions, which are represented by two quantum states and , to Alice and Bob respectively with a probability distribution . After obtaining the questions, Alice and Bob make some local operations to give their answers and respectively with a conditional probability distribution . Then the referee will pay them according to a given payoff function .  In the games, Alice and Bob share a bipartite quantum state , which can be regarded as the resource of nonlocality. In other words, Alice and Bob make use of the nonlocality of the state to get the payoff as much as possible.  More precisely, Alice and Bob try to choose an optimal to maximize the average payoff: There are two basic differences between nonlocal game and semi-nonlocal game. First, and are distinguishable for Alice and Bob, i.e., they are orthogonal in the nonlocal game; however, we require the completeness of the states in the operator space but not the orthogonality in the state space in the semi-nonlocal game.  Second, the criteria to win the games are different. In nonlocal game, Alice and Bob win if the payoff outweighs any LHV (Local Hidden Variables) states and lose otherwise. In the semi-nonlocal game, Alice and Bob win if the payoff is larger than that from any separable bipartite quantum state.  Here it is worthy to emphasize that, before the start of the games, Alice and Bob are allowed to communicate with each other to work out some strategies, then the communication is not permitted during the processes of the games.  In the two games, without using deterministic strategies, the conditional probabilities are given based on suitable quantum measurements.  In nonlocal game, is where and are the measurement make by Alice and Bob according to their received labels and of and . Since the construction of nonlocal game is based on Bell inequality , from the form of Bell inequality(like CHSH inequality ) we can easily get the desired and .  In semi-quantum nonlocal game, for any entangled state, the distribution is written as follows where is the POVM Alice makes on the entangled state and her received state , and is Bob’s POVM. of entangled states is out of reach for any separable states, which makes the payoff of any entangled state larger than separable states.">

<outline text="Our entanglement witness game" _note="In this section, we propose a quantum game to use entanglement as a resource. To simplify our notations, we assume that is a two-qubit state.  The procedure of our entanglement witness game is as follows.  First, the referee randomly sends the labels to Alice and Bob with probability ;  Second, according to labels received from the referee, Alice and Bob do the following measurements and then Alice and Bob return the measurement results back to the referee;  Third, the referee pays them according to the payoff function , where the referee chooses such that is an entanglement witness of in the case when is entangled, where , are Pauli matrices.  Since is the entanglement witness of the entangled state , we have where is any separable state. Notice that the average payoff which ensures that only when is entangled the average payoff is positive. Further more, because there always exists an entanglement witness for any entangled state , the payoff function based on the entanglement witness can be constructed, which makes any entanglement can be distinguished in our game.  For the referee, the process of our entanglement witness game is a stochastic tomography of a two-qubit state. When an ensemble of a two-qubit state is input, the two-qubit state can be reconstructed by the referee with the answers from Alice and Bob. The entanglement witness is involved in our game through a proper choice of the payoff function. Because the entanglement witness is relative to a given entangled state, the payoff functions may be different for different entangled states shared by the players. In particular, for any entanglement state, we only need to adopt a proper entanglement witness to design the payoff function for our entanglement witness game.  Different from the traditional nonlocal game, where the player can win only when they share Bell nonlocal state, our entanglement witness game gives a positive average payoff if the players share a proper entangled state (which may not violate any Bell inequality). The reason for this is that, in the traditional game, the player can choose any two local measurements, while in our game, they are restricted to the four fixed measurement operators.  Our entanglement witness game can be easily extend to multipartite situations. We use three-qubit scenario to illustrate this. For tripartite games, there are three players, Alice, Bob and Charlie. The entanglement witness of three-qubit entangled states can be decomposed as The same as bipartite scenario, the referee send Alice, Bob and Charlie four labels , and the players do the measurement of . Then they send back their binary-outcome results , the referee pay them according to the payoff function . Then the average payoff would be Only when is a tripartite entangled state, the payoff is larger than zero.">

<outline text="Explicit Examples: Two-qubit case" _note="In this section, we give two explicit examples to show how to play our entanglement witness game, and show that Alice and Bob are required to be honest in our game.  In the first example, Alice and Bob share the Werner state : where , , . The entanglement witness of this Werner state is The factor in makes the projection of into the linear space expanded by is a normalized vector if we define the inner product for any two Hermitian operators.  In fact, any two-qubit density matrix is an element in the linear space expanded by . Since , the component of is . Thus all the two-qubit density matrices form a convex body in dimensional linear space, where a general entanglement witness for two-qubit states lies in according to convex analysis . Usually, it is more convenient to study its subspaces, e.g., a dimensional subspace, or even a dimensional subspace.  Here we focus on the dimensional subspace expanded by , and the projections of two-qubit states and the entanglement witness are shown in Fig.  . The coordinate for any two-qubit state in this subspace is given by with . In this subspace, the numerical range  for all two-qubit states is the regular tetrahedron with vertexes , and the numerical range for all separable two-qubit states is the octahedron with vertexes . The gray hyperplane is defined by . The Werner state is represented by a red line, which intersects with the hyperplane at .  According to the rule of our entanglement witness game, the average payoff for the Werner state is which is the geometric distance between the state and the hyperplane. As we know, is entangled only when . The above equation shows that when the payoff is larger than zero, which shows that the entanglement in the Werner state is a useful resource for our entanglement witness game.  Here let us explain why Alice and Bob are required to be honest in our game by an explicit construction. Assume that Alice and Bob share the classical correlated state with Then they can simulate the correlations in the entangled state in a scheme discussed by them before the game starts as follows. When the referee sends , , and to Alice (Bob), Alice (Bob) measures () respectively. Alice and Bob return the measurement results to the referee. Then Alice and Bob will get the maximal average payoff in our game based on the entanglement witness . This construction shows that the players can get a positive average payoff without shared entanglement if they are allowed to be dishonest in our entanglement witness game.  Another example is from the CHSH inequality, in this example we will show the relation between the CHSH inequality and our entanglement witness game. This relation is based on the relation between CHSH inequality and entanglement witness . The CHSH inequality gives entanglement witness  For the Werner state , especially the state when , Alice and Bob randomly choose their spin observables: Now the CHSH entanglement witnesses become where a normalized factor is contained.  Because is related with , which motivates us to consider the dimensional subspace expanded by them. The similar numerical results are shown in Fig.  . Now the numerical range for all two-qubit states is the black square, and the numerical range for all separable two-qubit states is the blue square. The hyperplanes is the green line, and the Werner state is denoted as the red line, which intersects with the green line at .  In our entanglement witness game, the average payoff is which is the geometric distance from a Werner state to the green line. When , we require that . As expected, implies is entangled. However, when , is entangled but not detected in our entanglement witness game based on the CHSH inequality, which is consistent with .  In fact, in our entanglement witness game, we strengthen the CHSH entanglement witness as which corresponds to a gray line in Fig.   defined by . The Werner state interact with the gray line at .  Then for the Werner state, the average payoff For given by Eq. , the Bell inequality as entanglement witness can be strengthened as Even after the strengthen, only the Werner state for is entanglement witnessed, and the entangled Werner state for is not detected in our entanglement witness game.  From the above two typical examples of our entanglement witness game, we find that the higher dimension of the consider subspace, more entangled states are useful for our entanglement witness game. An interesting question to be explored in future arises: what is the lowest dimension of the subspace to make all entangled states are useful in our entanglement witness game?">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this paper, we proposed an entanglement witness game, which ensures any entangled state can have a positive payoff while separable states can not. The process of our entanglement witness game, in the viewpoint of the referee, is a stochastic local quantum state tomography, which makes the referee has the capacity to obtain the entangled state shared by the players asymptotically. It is worthy to point out if the players are dishonest, they may get positive average payoff without shared entanglement, which is not robust as in the semi-nonlocal game.  Compared with the nonlocal game from the Bell inequalities, any entangled state is useful in our entanglement witness game, while in the traditional one, only the entangled states violating Bell inequalities has advantage over separable states. Compared with the semi-quantum nonlocal game, we do not need quantum channels to transfer non-orthogonal quantum states from the referee to the players. In addition, the procedure is relative simpler than the previous ones, and it is more directly based on entanglement witness. Our entanglement witness game can use any entangled state as a resource by adopting its entanglement witness to design the payoff function, and it can be implemented similarly as the entanglement witness experiments .  We hope our work will increase our understandings on Bell nonlocality and entanglement through different quantum games, and promote their applications in quantum information processes.
