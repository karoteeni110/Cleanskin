<outline text="Introduction" _note="We study various adjacency relations for Cartesian products of multiple digital images. We are particularly interested in “product properties” - properties that are preserved by taking Cartesian products - and “factor properties” for which possession by a Cartesian product of digital images implies possession of the property by the factors. Many of the properties examined in this paper were considered in  for adjacencies based on the normal product adjacency. We consider other adjacencies in this paper, including the tensor product adjacency, the Cartesian product adjacency, and the composition or lexicographic adjacency.">

We use , , and to represent the sets of natural numbers, integers, and real numbers, respectively,  A digital image is a graph. Usually, we consider the vertex set of a digital image to be a subset of for some . Further, we often, although not always, restrict our study of digital images to finite graphs. We will assume familiarity with the topological theory of digital images. See, e.g., for many of the standard definitions. All digital images are assumed to carry their own adjacency relations (which may differ from one image to another). When we wish to emphasize the particular adjacency relation we write the image as , where represents the adjacency relation.">
  <outline text="Common adjacencies" _note="To denote that and are -adjacent points of some digital image, we use the notation , or when can be understood.  The -adjacencies are commonly used. Let , . Let be an integer, . We say and are -adjacent, , if  there are at most indices for which , and  for all indices such that we have .  A -adjacency is often denoted by the number of points adjacent to a given point in using this adjacency. E.g.,  In , -adjacency is 2-adjacency.  In , -adjacency is 4-adjacency and -adjacency is 8-adjacency.  In , -adjacency is 6-adjacency, -adjacency is 18-adjacency, and -adjacency is 26-adjacency.  For Cartesian products of digital images, the normal product adjacency (see Definitions   and  ) has been used in papers including  (errors in  are corrected in ). The tensor product adjacency (see Definition  ), Cartesian product adjacency (see Definition  ), and the lexicographic adjacency (see Definition  ) have not to our knowledge been studied in digital topology, so their respective roles in digital topology remain to be determined.  Given digital images or graphs and , the [NORMAL PRODUCT ADJACENCY]{} , also called the [STRONG PRODUCT ADJACENCY]{} (denoted in ) generated by and on the Cartesian product is defined as follows.    []{} Let , . Then and are -adjacent in if and only if   and ; or   and ; or   and .  As a generalization of Definition  , we have the following.    []{} Let and be positive integers, . Let be digital images. Let be the adjacency defined on the Cartesian product as follows. For , and are -adjacent if and only if  for at least 1 and at most indices , , and  for all other indices , .

[]{}   The [CARTESIAN PRODUCT ADJACENCY]{} on the Cartesian product of , denoted or , is as follows. Given , we have and are -adjacent in if and only if for some  , , and for all indices , .

For two subsets , we will say that and are ADJACENT when there exist points and such that and are equal or adjacent. Thus sets with nonempty intersection are automatically adjacent, while disjoint sets may or may not be adjacent. It is easy to see that a finite union of connected adjacent sets is connected.">

  <outline text="Continuous multifunctions" _note="  []{} Let , . Let be a continuous multivalued function. Let be a continuous function that induces . Let . Then there is a continuous function that induces .  For the adjacency, we have the following.    []{} Given multivalued functions , , each is continuous if and only if the product multivalued function is continuous.  For the tensor product, since a single-valued function can be considered as multivalued, Example   shows there is no general product rule for the continuity of multivalued functions. However, we have the following.    Let be a continuous multivalued function between digital images, . Let , , . If for some positive integer  and for all  there is a continuous locally one-to-one function that generates , then is -continuous and is generated by a function that is locally one-to-one.  Let . It follows from Theorem   that is -continuous. Further, given where for and where , there exists such that . Therefore, .  For in , we have and , where and . Since is locally one-to-one and continuous, we have . It follows that . This allows us to conclude that is -continuous. Thus, generates .  Let in , where . Since is locally one-to-one, for all . Therefore, , so is locally one-to-one.  Deciding whether the converse of Theorem   is true appears to be a difficult problem.  For the Cartesian product adjacency, we have the following.    Let be a multivalued function between digital images, where , , . Let , , . If each is continuous, then is -continuous.  Suppose each is continuous. By Lemma  , there exists and generating functions of .  We wish to show that generates . Suppose in . Then and where and for all but one index , with .

Thus, generates , so is continuous.  Deciding whether the converse of Theorem   is true appears to be a difficult problem.  For the lexicographic adjacency, there is no general product rule for the continuity of multivalued functions, as shown in Example   (since a single-valued function can be regarded as multivalued). However, we have the following.    Let be a continuous multivalued function between digital images, . Let , , . If each is generated by a function that is locally one-to-one, then is -continuous.  By Theorem  , the single-valued function is -continuous. Further, given with , there exist such that . Therefore, . Therefore, generates , and the assertion follows.  The paper  has several results concerning the following notions.  []{} Let be a digital image and .

For the Cartesian product adjacency, we have the following.    Let be multivalued retractions, . Let , , . Then is a -multivalued retraction.

  <outline text="Connectivity preserving multifunctions" _note="  []{} Let be a multivalued function between digital images, . Then the product map is a connectivity preserving multifunction if and only if each is a connectivity preserving multifunction.  The tensor product adjacency does not yield a similar result, as shown in the following.  Consider , . The multivalued function defined by is connectivity preserving. However, is not -connectivity preserving.  This follows from the observations that has a single point, hence must be -connected; but, by Example  , is not -connected.  However, we have the following.  Let be multivalued functions, . Let , . Suppose is -connectivity preserving. Then each is connectivity preserving.  Let , where . By assumption, is -connected. From Theorem  , it follows that is -connected.  Suppose in . Then . Since is connectivity preserving, and are -adjacent subsets of . This implies there exist , such that or . Therefore, for each index , or . Since and , we have that and are -adjacent subsets of .  From Theorem  , is connectivity preserving.  For the Cartesian product adjacency, we have the following.  Let and be digital images, for . Let be a multivalued function. Let be the product function. Then is -connectivity preserving if and only if each is connectivity preserving.  Suppose is connectivity preserving. Let , where . Then is -connected. By Theorem  , is -connected.  For any given index , let in . For all indices , let . Then and are -adjacent. Since is connectivity preserving, and are -adjacent subsets of . Therefore, Theorem   implies and are -adjacent subsets of . It follows from Theorem   that is connectivity preserving. Since was an arbitrarily selected index, is connectivity preserving for all .  Now suppose each is connectivity preserving. Let where . Then is, by Theorem  , -connected.  Suppose in . Then for some index , in and for there exist such that Since is connectivity preserving, there exist and such that or . For , let . Then and are -adjacent or equal. Therefore, and are -adjacent subsets of . It follows from Theorem   that is connectivity preserving.  For lexicographic adjacency,  Example   shows that there is no product property for connectivity preservation; and  there is no factor property for connectivity preservation, as the following example shows.  Let be the multivalued function . Let be the multivalued function . Then is -connectivity preserving, but is not -connectivity preserving.  This follows from the observations that the single point is connected, and is -connected (see Figure 2).">

<outline text="Shy maps" _note="We have the following.  Let be a shy map of digital images. Then is an isomorphism if and only if is locally one-to-one.  It is obvious that if is an isomorphism, then is locally one-to-one.  To show the converse, we argue as follows. Since is shy, we know is a continuous surjection.  To show is one-to-one, suppose there exist such that . Since is shy, is -connected. Therefore, if then there is a path of distinct points such that , for , and . But since is locally one-to-one, is one-to-one, so , contrary to the assumption . Therefore, we must have , so is one-to-one.  Since is one-to-one, is one-to-one. Since is shy, given in , is connected. Thus, is continuous. This completes the proof that is an isomorphism.  The following generalizes a result of .    []{} Let be a continuous surjection between digital images, . Then the product map is shy if and only if each is a shy map.  For the tensor product, we have the following.    Let be a surjection between digital images, . Let , . If the product function is shy, then is shy for each .  Since is shy, it is continuous, so by Theorem  , each is continuous. Clearly, each is a surjection.  Let . Let . Since is shy, is -connected. By Theorem  , is -connected.  Let in . Then . Since is shy, is -connected. By Theorem  , is -connected. From Definition  , we conclude that is a shy map.  The converse to Theorem   is not generally true, as shown by the following.  Let be the function . Let be the function . Then and are shy, but is not shy.  That and are shy is easily seen. Further, is a surjection. Notice that , but and are neither equal nor -adjacent. Therefore, is not -continuous, hence is not -shy.  For the Cartesian product adjacency, we have the following.    Let be a surjection between digital images, . Let , . Then the product function is shy if and only if is shy for each .  Suppose is shy. Then clearly each is a surjection, and by Theorem  , is continuous.  Let . Let . Since is shy, is -connected. By Theorem  , the projection map is continuous, so is -connected.  Let be such that . Then must be among the points , where satisfies . Since is shy, is -connected. Since is continuous, is -connected. This completes the proof that each is shy.  Suppose each is shy. Then clearly is a surjection, and by Theorem  , is continuous.  Let . Let . Since is shy, is -connected. By Theorem  ,  Let be such that . Then for some index , , where satisfies . Similarly,  Since is shy, is connected, so there exist , such that or . For indices , let . Then and satisfy From statements ( ), ( ), and ( ), we conclude that is -connected. Therefore, is shy.  For the lexicographic adjacency, we have the following.    Let be functions between digital images, . Let , , . If each is shy, then is shy.  Let , where . Then . Since each is shy, is -connected. By Theorem  , is -connected.  Let in . Then for some smallest index , and if then for . Since is shy, is -connected. Further, if then is connected, since is shy. Now,  By the shyness of the and Theorem  , each of and is -connected. Further, since for and, by shyness of , from statements ( ), ( ), and ( ) we can conclude that and are -adjacent sets. Therefore, is -connected. Therefore, is shy.  The following shows that the converse of Theorem   is not generally true.  Let be the function . Let be the function . Then is shy, but is not shy.  Since is not connected, is not shy. However, is -connected, as discussed in Example  , so, from Definition  , is shy.">

<outline text="Further remarks" _note="We have studied the tensor product, Cartesian product, and lexicographic adjacencies for finite Cartesian products of digital images. We have obtained many results for “product&quot; and “factor&quot; properties that parallel results obtained for extensions of the normal product adjacency in .  However, there are many properties known  for the normal product adjacency whose analogs for the adjacencies studied here are either false or we were not able to derive. By comparing the results of  with those of the current paper, it appears that the normal product adjacency is the adjacency that yields the most satisfying results for Cartesian products of digital images.">
