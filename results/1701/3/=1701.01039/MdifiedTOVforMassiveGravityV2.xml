    <title>Neutron stars structure in the context of massive gravity</title>
    <abstract>Motivated by the recent interests in spin massive gravitons, we study
the structure of neutron star in the context of massive gravity. The
modifications of TOV equation in the presence of massive gravity are
explored in and higher dimensions. Next, by considering the modern
equation of state for the neutron star matter (which is extracted by the
lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method with the AV
potential), different physical properties of the neutron star (such as
Le Chatelier’s principle, stability and energy conditions) are
investigated. It is shown that consideration of the massive gravity has
specific contributions into the structure of neutron star and introduces
new prescriptions for the massive astrophysical objects. The mass-radius
relation is examined and the effects of massive gravity on the
Schwarzschild radius, average density, compactness, gravitational
redshift and dynamical stability are studied. Finally, a relation
between mass and radius of neutron star versus the Planck mass is
extracted. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The Einstein theory of gravity has been a pioneering tool for understanding and describing the gravitational systems. Most of the results and validations of this theory have been confirmed by observations done on solar system level. In addition, the results of LIGO proved the existence of gravitational wave which was one of the challenging predictions of general relativity (GR) . It is expected to observe the advantages of GR for beyond the Newtonian theory regimes (high curvature regimes) such as near the compact objects. The existence of compact objects has been confirmed in the Einstein theory. Due to the physical properties of these objects, it is necessary to take the curvature of spacetime into account in order to have reliable predictions. Therefore, we employ the Einstein theory of gravity to study the neutron star.  Einstein theory predicts the existence of massless spin- gravitons with two degrees of freedom as intermediate particles for signaling the gravitational interactions. But, there have been several arguments regarding the possibility of existence of massive gravitons. These arguments are supported by studies that are conducted on quantum level of gravity and brane-world gravity. Especially problems such as the hierarchy problem and their brane-world gravity solutions have expressed on the possibility of existence of massive spin- gravitons [DvaliGP,DvaliGPI]{}. Therefore, it is natural to relax massless constraint and consider the modifications and generalizations of the general relativity to include massive graviton. In this paper, we generalize the Einstein theory of gravity to include the massive graviton and investigate its effects on the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of a typical neutron star.  The first attempt for constructing the massive gravity was done by Fierz and Pauli . This theory has the specific problem known as vDVZ (van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov) discontinuity which indicates that the propagators of massless and massive in the limit of , are not the same [van Dam,Zakharov,DeserW]{}. One of the resolutions of this problem was Vainshtein mechanism which requires the system to be considered in the nonlinear framework (it is notable that in nonlinear dRGT, there are also vacua that are free from vDVZ discontinuity ). Such generalization to nonlinear case introduces a ghost into the theory which is known as Boulware-Deser ghost . There are various ghost free scenarios for considering the massive gravity in the nonlinear framework. One of the interesting ghost free theories of massive gravity is known as dRGT theory which was developed by de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley . In this theory, a reference metric is employed to build massive terms . These massive terms are inserted in the action to provide massive gravitons. Cosmological results, black hole solutions and their thermodynamical properties in this massive gravity are investigated by many authors . In addition, Katsuragawa et al, studied the neutron stars in the context of dRGT theory and showed that, the massive gravity leads to small deviation from the GR .  It is worthwhile to mention that the reference metric plays a key role for constructing the massive theory of gravity . One of the modifications in reference metric was done by Vegh which introduced a new massive gravity . This new massive theory has specific applications in the gauge/gravity duality especially in lattice physics which motivate one to use it in other frameworks as well. This theory was employed in the context of black holes and it was shown that geometrical and thermodynamical structures of the black holes will be modified and new phenomena were reported for massive black holes [CaiHPZ,HendiEPJHEP2015,XuCH,GhoshTW,HendiPEJHEP,HendiEPJHEP2016,SureshK,Upadhyay,Rappid]{}. Here, we use this massive theory to conduct our studies in the properties of neutron star.  The structure of stars and their phenomenological properties are described with hydrostatic equilibrium equation (HEE). This equation is based on the fact that a typical star will be in equilibrium when there is a balance between the internal pressure and the gravitational force. Historically speaking, the first HEE equation for GR was introduced and employed by Tolman, Oppenheimer and Volkoff (TOV) . After that, a series of studies were dedicated to obtain HEE of neutron star . In addition, the compact objects and their TOV equations were investigated in the presence of different modified gravities such as; gravity’s rainbow , vector-tensor-Horndeski theory of gravity , dilaton gravity , and gravities (see for more details).  According to recent studies on the neutron stars and observations of the interesting properties of them , we want to investigate these stars in the context of massive gravity. In other words, our main motivation in this paper is studying the effects of considering the massive gravity on the structure of neutron stars. Previous studies in the context of other astrophysical objects have proven a wide variation in the properties of these objects comparing to the massless graviton case. Therefore, we are expecting to see the specific modifications in the properties of neutron star as well. Here, we would like to address how the structure of neutron star will be modified in the presence of massive gravity and which contributions this generalization has into properties of these objects. We regard the HEE equation in and higher dimensions with a suitable equation of state (EoS), which satisfies stability, energy conditions and Le Chatelier’s principle. We obtain the maximum mass and corresponding radius, Schwarzschild radius, compactness, gravitational redshift and dynamical stability of the neutron stars. We give details regarding the effects of massive gravity on these properties. These studies provide an insight into the structure of neutron stars and enable one to make a comparison between the massive and massless gravity theories. Remembering that the neutron stars, similar to other massive objects, propagate the gravitational waves, one is urged to study the neutron stars in the presence of massive gravity which is the aim of this paper.  The outline of our paper is as follows. In Sec.  , we consider a spherical symmetric metric and obtain the modified TOV in Einstein-massive gravity in four dimensions. Next, we employ the specific many-body EoS and study its properties such as the Le Chatelier’s principle, stability and energy conditions. Then, considering the Einstein-massive gravity, we investigate the neutron star structure and obtain other properties of this star. In next section, we extract mass and radius of this star versus the Planck mass as a fundamental physical constant. Finally, we finish our paper with some closing remarks.">

  <outline text="Modified TOV equation in (3+1)-dimensions" _note="In this section, the static solutions of EN-massive gravity in -dimensions are obtained. For this purpose, we consider a spherical symmetric space-time in the following form where and are unknown metric functions. Now, in order to obtain exact solutions, we should consider a suitable reference metric. Obeying the ansatz of Ref. , we consider the following relation for the reference metric in which is a positive constant. Considering the metric ansatz ( ), we can obtain the explicit forms of nonzero ’s as  Here, we regard the neutron star as a perfect fluid with the following energy-momentum tensor where and are the pressure and density of the fluid which are measured by the local observer, respectively, and is the fluid four-velocity. Using Eqs. ( ) and ( ) with the metric introduced in Eq. ( ), it is easy to obtain the components of energy-momentum as  In addition, taking into account Eqs. ( ) and ( ), it is straightforward to achieve the following nonzero components of field equation ( ) where , and , , and are functions of . Also, we note that the prime and double prime denote the first and the second derivatives with respect to , respectively.  Using Eqs. ( )-( ) and after some calculations, we obtain  In addition, for extracting , we can use Eq. ( ) which leads to in which . Now, we obtain from Eq. ( ) and insert it with Eq. ( ) in Eq. ( ) to calculate HEE in the Einstein-massive gravity with the following form which is modified TOV equation due to the presence of massive graviton. As one expects, for , Eq. ( ) is reduced to the following TOV equation obtained in Einstein- gravity  In addition, in the absence of both massive term and cosmological constant (), Eq. ( ) leads to the usual TOV equation of Einstein gravity (see for more details). It is notable that, the generalization to higher dimensions is done in the appendix A.  Before applying the mentioned gravitational framework on the neutron star structure, we should point out some comments for the mentioned massive gravity. As we mentioned before, the massive gravity employed in this paper is essentially a dRGT like . It was shown that all dRGT like theories of the massive gravity in dimensions with scalar fields (Stückelberg fields) enjoy at most number of degrees of freedom. The reference metric employed in this paper is spatial reference metric which in its simpler form in the appropriate orthonormal coordinate, it will be . This specific choice in reference metric leads into interesting results which among them one can point out that under certain coordinate transformation, the general covariance is preserved in radial and temporal coordinates while it breaks in spatial dimensions . Therefore, this theory indeed enjoys Lorentz violating property. On the other hand, it was shown that this choice of reference metric and more general ones enjoy the preservation of the Hamiltonian constraint which leads to removing one of the degrees of freedom. In addition, based on the diffeomorphism, another degree of freedom is eliminated. In general, since this is a dimensional theory of massive gravity, there might be up to degrees of freedom. Two of these degrees of freedom were eliminated due to mentioned properties. On the other hand, it was also shown that only two Stückelberg fields exist in the diffeomorphism invariant formulation of this theory . This indicates that two degrees of freedom are absent which leads to absence of Boulware-Deser (BD) ghost.  To summarize, it is notable that depending on the notion of time, the number of degrees of freedom can differ from two to five. Although an observer with arbitrary time has to describe five degrees of freedom, the observers with Stückelberg time function will describe two degrees of freedom such as the situation of massless gravitons in the usual general relativity.  The full details regarding absence of the BD ghost in this massive gravity are given in Refs . Especially in Ref. , the stability of massive gravity with singular metric of arbitrary rank was studied and the absence of BD ghost was proven.  Evaluating the second derivatives of the massive action with respect to the background graviton field, one can obtain a mass matrix. In this case, the eigenvalues of the matrix would correspond to the masses of each mode, the so-called, , , etc. These are the mass fluctuations of the modes which are depending on the non-trivial contributions of the Stückelberg function. In other words, such mass fluctuations are depending on the free parameters of the massive theory such as and , etc. So, it would be useful to calculate the physical mass of fluctuations and impose appropriate conditions to avoid tachyon-like instabilities. Taking into account the point of Ref. , we can regard that the mass parameter is of the order of the Hubble parameter today, and therefore, such an instability would not be problematic. However, since the tachyon-like instabilities are very important in some gravitational framework, such as black holes, we will address such substantial point in an independent paper.">

  <outline text="Equation of state of neutron star matter" _note="The interior region of a typical neutron star is a mixed soup of neutrons, protons, electrons and muons in charge neutrality and beta equilibrium conditions (beta-stable matter) . This balanced mixture is governed by unknown EoS. One of the EoS which could be employed to study the neutron star is the microscopic constrained variational calculations based on the cluster expansion. This EoS has been employed to study the structure of neutron star matter before . Fundamentally, the mentioned model is based on two-nucleon potentials which are the modern Argonne AV and charged dependent Reid- . It is notable that this method requires no free parameter, has a good convergence and is more accurate comparing to other semi-empirical parabolic approximation methods. These advantages come from a microscopic computation of asymmetry energy which is carried on for the asymmetric nuclear matter calculations. The necessity of microscopic calculations with the modern nucleon-nucleon potentials which is isospin projection () dependent was pointed out in Ref. . Here, we employ the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method with the AV potential [Bordbar]{} for obtaining the modern EoS for neutron star matter and investigating some physical properties of neutron star structure.  As we mentioned, the energy of the system under study is obtained by the LOCV method which is a fully self-consistent formalism. Through a normalization constraint, this method keeps the higher order terms as small as possible . In addition, this method has been employed to calculate the properties of neutron, nuclear and asymmetric nuclear matters at zero and finite temperatures . The functional minimization procedure represents an enormous computational simplification over the unconstrained methods which attempt to go beyond the lowest order.  A trial many-body wave function is where is the uncorrelated ground-state wave function of independent neutrons, and is a proper -body correlation function. Here, we apply Jastrow approximation to replace as where and are a symmetrizing operator and the two-body correlation function, respectively.

In other words, the energy per particle up to the two-body term is where and are one-body and two-body energy terms, respectively. It is notable that, is the Fermi momentum of a neutron with spin projection . The operator is nuclear potential and it has been given in Ref. (see Refs. for more details). The behavior of obtained EoS of neutron star matter is shown in Fig.  . We extract the mathematical forms for the EoS presented in Fig.   as in which are  In order to investigate the properties of such EoS with more details, we study Le Chatelier’s principle condition in the following subsection.

  <outline text="Mass-radius relation and other properties of neutron star in massive gravity" _note="Considering the maximum gravitational mass of a neutron star for dynamical stability against gravitational collapse into a black hole, one is able to make differences between neutron star and black holes. In other words, there is a critical maximum mass for the massive object in which for masses larger than the maximum value, the massive object becomes a black hole [Shapiro]{}. The value of maximum mass originated from the nucleons degeneracy pressure is evidently the possible maximum mass of neutron star. Therefore, obtaining the maximum gravitational mass of neutron star is of a great interest, and important in astrophysics. Unfortunately, the advanced observational technologies for measuring the mass of neutron star by investigating the X-ray pulsars and X-ray bursters were not able to produce accurate results. Nevertheless the measurements that are done with the binary radio pulsars , provided highly accurate results for the mass of neutron star. In Ref. , the Einstein gravity has been investigated, and maximum mass of neutron star has been obtained using the modern equations of state of neutron star matter obtained from the microscopic calculations. It was shown that the maximum mass of neutron star is about . In addition, the EoS with dilaton gravity was employed and the properties of neutron star were investigated . The results showed that by increasing the effects of dilaton gravity, the maximum mass of this star decreases (). Here, we intend to obtain the maximum mass of neutron star by considering the obtained TOV equation for Einstein-massive gravity (Eq. ( )) and investigate the properties of neutron star.  Now, by employing the EoS of neutron star matter presented in Fig.   and numerical approach for integrating the HEE obtained in Eq. ( ), we can calculate the maximum mass and other properties of the neutron star. To do so, one can consider the boundary conditions and , and integrates Eq. ( ) outwards to a radius in which vanishes for selecting a . This leads to the neutron star radius and mass . We present the results in different figures and tables (see Figs.   and  , and tables [tab1]{},   and   for more details).  It is notable that, here, we ignore the effects of cosmological constant on the structure of neutron star. For investigating its effects, we refer the interested reader to Ref. , in which, it was shown that, this constant has no effect on the structure of this star when the cosmological constant is about . Now, we are in a position to study the properties of neutron star in massive gravity. First, we consider the mass of graviton about , which was obtained in Ref. . Next, we use obtained results by A. W. Steiner et al in which an empirical dense matter EoS from a heterogeneous data set of six neutron stars was obtained. Their results showed that the radius of a neutron star must be in the range of . In the present paper, we consider the maximum radius of neutron star in the range of and investigate the maximum mass for neutron star in the massive gravity by employing the modern EoS of neutron star matter derived from microscopic calculations. According to the table  , considering the spacial values for the parameters of the modified TOV equation, the maximum mass of neutron star is an increasing function of . Calculations show that the maximum mass of neutron star can be more than (), whereas in the Einstein gravity and by using this EoS, the maximum mass was in the range of . A mass measurement for PSR J1614-2230 showed that the mass for neutron star was about . In other words, our results cover the mass measurement of massive neutron star, and also, predict that the mass of neutron star in massive gravity can be in the range upper than (see the table   for more details). Also, by decreasing the value of less than (), the maximum mass and radius of neutron star are not affected. In other words, considering the value of about , the maximum mass and radius of neutron star reduce to the obtained results of massless Einstein gravity .  On the other hand, the average density () of the neutron star calculated in the tables  ,   and   shows that the central density may exceed a few times as . In other words, it is larger than the normal nuclear density, .  For further investigation, we plot the mass of neutron star versus the central mass density () in left panels of Figs.   and  . As one can see, the maximum mass of this star increases as increases. On the other hand, the variation of maximum mass versus radius is also shown in right panels of Figs.   and [Fig4]{}.  Now, we complete our discussion by considering the gravitational mass equal to , with various values for different parameters of modified TOV equation (see Eq. ( )) and obtain the maximum mass of neutron star in the massive gravity. The results are presented in the tables   and  . According to the table  , the maximum mass of neutron star is an increasing function of . It is notable that considering the values less than for , the maximum mass and corresponding radius of neutron star are not affected. In other words, these results reduce to the obtained results of the maximum mass and radius of neutron star in the Einstein gravity . The variation of has very interesting effects. In this case, the maximum mass and radius of this star are constant and by variation of , these quantities are not affected (see the table  ).  For completeness, in the following, we investigate other properties of neutron star in this gravity such as the Schwarzschild radius, average density, compactness, the gravitational redshift and dynamical stability.">
    <outline text="modified Schwarzschild Radius" _note="It is clear that by applying the massive term to the Einstein gravity, the Schwarzschild radius is modified. Considering Eq. ( ) and using the horizon radius constraint (), we can obtain the Schwarzschild radius () for the EN-massive gravity. After some calculations, the Schwarzschild radius for this gravity without the cosmological constant is obtained as  Using the series expansion of for the limit , we find that where the first term is the Schwarzschild radius in Einstein gravity [Schwarzschild]{}, as expected, and the second term indicates the massive correction.  In order to investigate the effects of various parameters on the modified Schwarzschild radius, one can look at the tables  ,   and  . As one can see in tables   and  , by increasing the maximum mass and radius of neutron star, the Schwarzschild radius increases and these stars are out of the Schwarzschild radius. Also, considering the negative value of and increasing , the Schwarzschild radius increases (see table  ). On the other hand, by increasing , the Schwarzschild radius increases (see table [tab2]{}).

The neutron stars are supported against the gravitational force by degeneracy pressure of nucleons which is mainly related to the strong repulsive inter-nucleons force. It is notable that the nucleon-nucleon interaction is so strong, and it is taken place through the pion exchange. Therefore, we can consider the average density of a neutron star in term of the nucleus density using the following form (see Refs.

<outline text="Closing Remarks [CONCLUSION]" _note="In this paper, we considered the spherically symmetric metric and extracted a modified TOV equation of stars in the Einstein-massive gravity in dimensions. Then, we showed that for limit, the obtained TOV in Einstein-massive gravity reduces to the Einstein- gravity. The generalization of modified TOV equation to arbitrary dimensions was also done (see appendix A). Furthermore, we have considered an EoS, which was derived from microscopic calculations and investigated Le Chatelier’s principle for the mentioned EoS. It was shown that this equation is suitable for investigating the structure of neutron star.  Considering the modified TOV obtained in this paper, the structure of neutron star was investigated. The results showed that, the maximum mass of these stars increases when and increase (the results represented in various tables numerically). In addition, it was shown that by considering the constant values of and , the maximum mass of neutron star is independent of .  Then, we showed that by increasing the maximum mass of neutron star, the radius and the Schwarzschild radius increase as well. It is notable that, by regarding massive graviton, the Schwarzschild radius is modified. In order to conduct more investigations, we plotted some diagrams related to the mass-radius and mass-central mass density. We found that these figures are similar to the diagrams related to the mass-radius and mass-central mass density in usual GR. In addition, these diagrams confirmed the validity of obtained results in massive gravity.  After that the adiabatic index was investigated. It was shown that this star is dynamically stable. It is notable that the density and pressure are maximum at the center of the star and decrease monotonically towards the boundary.  Jacoby et al  and Verbiest et al used the detection of Shapiro delay to measure the masses of both the neutron star and its binary component.

Also, we predicted the existence of possible mass of more than .  Briefly, we obtained the quite interesting results from massive gravity for the neutron star such as:  I\) Obtaining the modified TOV equation. II) Prediction of maximum mass for neutron star more than , due to the existence of massive gravitons. III) Dynamically stable neutron star in the massive gravity. IV) EoS derived from microscopic calculations satisfied the energy, stability conditions and Le Chatelier’s principle, simultaneously. V) The Schwarzschild radius was modified in the presence of massive gravity. VI) Due to the considering massive graviton, the gravitational redshift was modified. VII) The relations between the mass and the radius of neutron star versus the Planck mass as a fundamental physical constant were extracted. VIII) Our consequences covered previous results and reduce to the Einstein gravity for massless graviton (), as expected.  Finally, it is notable that the investigation of other compact objects such as quark star and white dwarf in the context of massive gravity and its modified TOV equation are interesting subjects. Moreover, it is worth studying the effects of higher dimensions and other equation of states on the structure of compact objects. Also, anisotropic compact objects [HarkoM,BoehmerH,SunzuM,PaulD,NgubelangaM,MauryaG,RatanpalTP]{}, rotating, slowly rotating [slowly1,slowly2,slowly3,slowly4,slowly5,slowly6,slowly7]{}, rapidly rotating neutron stars and obtain the Buchdahl limit in the context of massive gravity are interesting topics.
