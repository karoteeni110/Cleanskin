<outline text="More figures on AB Ekmeans" _note="Figure   shows the clustering performance on 300000 random 2D point (K=5). Figure    shows the clustering output of our algorithm visualized on using the first three principal components of Human Eva training hog features. The figures shows that the cluster are spatially cohesive but not necessarily circular. This makes the elliptic distribution of the data captured by Mode 3 gives more accuracy membership measure me to the subdomains.  [0.5]{}  ">
