    <title>a note on spaces of continuous functions on compact scattered spaces</title>
    <abstract>In 1959, Pelczynski and Semadeni proved a theorem in which they gave
some equivalent conditions for a compact Hausdorff space to be
scattered. The purpose of the current note is that to clarify the
meaning of the subtle term “conditionally weakly sequentially compact”
they used as the basis for the proof of their theorem. Unfortunately,
the term now is taken over by a similar but subtle concept that may
cause a serious problem. </abstract>

<outline text="The main result" _note="A locally compact Hausdorff topological space is [SCATTERED]{} if does not contain any non-empty perfect subset (i.e., a closed non-empty subset of such that each point of is an accumulation point of ). Equivalently, any non-empty subset of contains at least one isolated point. Some authors use the term [DISPERSED]{} instead of scattered. For more details on scattered spaces see , and .    Consider with its usual topology and its one point compactification . Both and are scattered. Also, is another compact scattered space which is not discrete. It can be shown that a compact metric space is scattered if and only if it is countable . A scattered space is always totally disconnected. The converse of this is not true as seen by the set of rational numbers.  Consider the following two definitions for the term [CONDITIONALLY WEAKLY SEQUENTIALLY COMPACT]{}.    Let be a compact Hausdorff space. We say that has [CONDITIONALLY WEAKLY SEQUENTIALLY COMPACT PROPERTY IN THE SENSE OF]{} in the sense that for every bounded sequence of elements of there exists a subsequence and a member such that for every bounded linear functional on the sequence of numbers converges to . In other words, if is a bounded subset of , then must be conditionally (=relatively) weakly sequentially compact in the modern language.    Let be a compact Hausdorff space. We say that has [CONDITIONALLY WEAKLY SEQUENTIALLY COMPACT PROPERTY IN THE SENSE OF]{} if for every bounded sequence of elements of there exists a subsequence such that for every bounded linear functional on the sequence of numbers is convergent.  The way Definition   seems is now clear, but it was after a correspondence with Professor Semadeni that I could write down it this way. In the Definition  , the space is [**weakly sequentially complete**]{} while in the second one we do not need such a strong condition (not to the point ). Meanwhile, we use Definition   in Eberlin-Smulian theorem to assure weakly compactness of a given set.    Let be a compact Hausdorff space and have conditionally weakly sequentially compact property in the sense of . Then is finite.  [**Proof.**]{} Suppose to the contrary that is infinite. Then, the Banach space of continuous functions is infinite dimensional. It is well-known that the weak closure of the unit sphere of an infinite dimensional Banach space is the closed unit ball of the space . Therefore, if is the unit sphere of , then is equal to the unit ball of . Since has propert , is weakly sequentially compact. According to Eberlin-Smulian Theorem , must be weakly compact. Therefore by , must be reflexive. By , must be finite. But, this contradicts our assumption that was infinite. Hence, can only be a finite set.  Suppose is a compact Hausdorff space and the main theorem of holds. Condition (0) and (9) of the latter theorem assert that is scattered if and only if has conditionally weakly sequentially compact property in the sense of [**PS**]{}. But, if one wants to classify scatteredness of in the sense of [**EP**]{}, (s)he would always end up with a finite set! which is not always the case as Example   indicates.
