    <title>A luminous and isolated gamma-ray flare from the blazar 2</title>
    <abstract>2 is a BL Lac-type blazar that was first detected at TeV energies by the
MAGIC atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, and subsequently confirmed by
the VERITAS observatory with data collected between 2009 and 2012. In
2014 February 08, VERITAS detected a large-amplitude flare from 2 during
routine monitoring observations of the blazar 1ES 1218+304, located in
the same field of view. The TeV flux reached 2.4 times the Crab Nebula
flux with a variability timescale of h. Multiwavelength observations
with [FERMI]{}-LAT, [SWIFT]{}, and the Tuorla observatory revealed a
correlated high GeV flux state and no significant optical counterpart to
the flare, with a spectral energy distribution where the gamma-ray
luminosity exceeds the synchrotron luminosity. When interpreted in the
framework of a one-zone leptonic model, the observed emission implies a
high degree of beaming, with Doppler factor , and an electron population
with spectral index . </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Extreme flux variability is one of the defining properties of the blazar class of active galactic nuclei, appearing at all wavelengths over a wide range of timescales. Flares with amplitudes up to hundred times the quiescent flux and variability timescales as short as 3 minutes have been observed at TeV energies . To date, six flaring BL Lac-type blazars have been detected to exceed the flux of the Crab Nebula at TeV energies. The large signal statistics obtained during bright flares enable flux-variability studies on minute timescales, resulting in tighter constraints on the size and location of the gamma-ray emitting region and probing the particle acceleration and cooling mechanisms in blazar jets .  This paper describes a large-amplitude gamma-ray flare from the blazar 2 detected on UT date 2014 Feb 08, and compares its broadband properties to long-term observations of the source with VERITAS (TeV energies),  (GeV energies; ), and the Tuorla optical observatory. 2 (R.A. = , decl. = , J2000), also known as ON 325 or 1ES 1215+303, was first detected at TeV energies by MAGIC . At GeV energies it is associated with 3FGL J1217.8+3007 . There is some uncertainty in the distance to this source, with values of and being quoted for its spectroscopic redshift. Based on the location of its synchrotron peak, 2 has been either classified as an intermediate or high-frequency peaked BL Lac .  Throughout this paper we assume a Friedmann universe with kmsMpc, and . All distance-dependent quantities are calculated assuming a redshift (Mpc) for 2. Measurement uncertainties are statistical only unless indicated otherwise.">

<outline text="VERITAS Observations" _note="VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) is an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona, USA. VERITAS operates by recording Cherenkov light from particle showers initiated by gamma rays in the upper atmosphere and is sensitive to gamma-ray energies from about 85GeV to more than 30TeV .  Table   summarizes the VERITAS observations and results on 2. Observations were made in “wobble” pointing mode considering the presence of another TeV source in the field of view (1ES 1218+304, offset from 2) as described in . Data were processed using standard VERITAS analysis pipelines . The energy threshold of the analysis is 200GeV, with a systematic uncertainty of 20% on the energy estimation.  A TeV flare from 2 was detected in 2013 Feb 07 (MJD 56330, Figure  ) with flux , or 0.24Crab. The measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with a power-law with photon index , in line with reported in and from . A fit of the decaying phase of the flare (MJD 56330-56639) to a function results in an upper limit on the flux halving time of h at a 90% confidence level (c.l.).  A brighter subsequent flare from 2 was observed on 2014 Feb 08 (MJD 56696, Figure  ) with flux , or 2.4Crab. The reconstructed energy spectrum is compatible with a power-law with photon index between 0.2 and 2TeV (Figure  ). The observations targeted 1ES 1218+304 and had a mean zenith distance of , accumulating 45min of live-time exposure. On that night, a high-cloud layer at an altitude of km a.s.l. was measured by an onsite Vaisala CL51 ceilometer. On average, 30% of the Cherenkov light output in particle showers initiated by 200GeV gamma rays is produced above 11.2km . This fraction decreases with increasing gamma-ray energy . If all Cherenkov light emitted above the cloud layer is lost, VERITAS would underestimate the energy of incoming gamma rays by , which added to the 20% systematic uncertainty on the energy estimation results in the increased systematic error on the gamma-ray flux and spectral index measured in 2014 Feb 08. The large signal statistics during the flare allow flux measurements in 5-minute time bins (Figure  ). No significant flux variability was detected during the 45min exposure, with the light curve deviating from a constant flux hypothesis at a level of 2.8 standard deviations. Observations on the next night (2014 Feb 09) did not show an elevated flux from 2 (Table  ), implying a 90% c.l. limit on the flux halving time of h.   ">

Table   summarizes the  observations and results on 2. Data were analyzed using the unbinned likelihood analysis in LAT ScienceTools ([v10r0p5]{}) with [P8R2\_SOURCE\_V6]{} instrument response functions, selecting photons with energy in a circular region of radius centered on the position of 2. The energy spectrum of 2 was modeled with a power law. Further analysis details and standard quality cuts followed . Light curves were derived by dividing the data in bins of one and three days duration.  A clear flux peak is seen coinciding with the VERITAS-detected flare of 2014 Feb 08 (Figure  ), followed by a rapid decay that constrains the flux halving time to h at 90% c.l. (Figure  ). The GeV spectrum shows some evidence of hardening (), going from an averaged during the 2014 campaign to in the four days of highest GeV flux (MJD 56693-56696). In 2013, the LAT light curve shows no significant flux variability (Figure  ). However, the same TeV to GeV flare amplitude ratio seen in 2014 can be accomodated within the error bars of the 2013 LAT light curve.">

The exposure shows a stable source-count rate of , suggesting negligible pile-up effects.

<outline text="Discussion" _note="With the data presented here and in , VERITAS has published TeV observations of 2 spanning over 50 nights between 2008 and 2014, finding no significant deviations from yearly-averaged fluxes other than the flares on 2013 Feb 07 and 2014 Feb 08 reported in this paper. These two TeV flares had amplitudes of and times the average quiescent flux from 2, with associated flux halving times of and hours, respectively. Such large-amplitude, short-lived, isolated flares are not common in TeV-emitting blazars. Fast variability is typically measured during longer high-flux states in HBLs , while some quasars and IBLs show short periods of TeV emission in epochs where multiple GeV flares are seen .  In the following we summarize the main observational properties of the brightest flare of 2014 Feb 08 and interpret them in the framework of an homogeneous one-zone leptonic emission scenario:  \(i) The measured flux above 0.2TeV was . This corresponds to an isotropic luminosity erg s. To date, only four other blazars have episodically been observed to emit TeV radiation with luminosity exceeding ergs. For comparison, the historical TeV blazar Mrk 421 would have to exhibit a 35Crab flare to reach the luminosity of the 2 outburst reported here.  \(ii) A non-detection by VERITAS 24h after the flare indicates a flux halving time h at TeV energies. Causality implies that the observed variability timescale is related to the size () and Doppler factor () of the gamma-ray emitting region by  \(iii) The TeV flare was accompanied by a significant GeV flare measured by  that extended over four days and displayed some evidence for spectral hardening, with .  \(iv) Optical observations did not show enhanced emission in coincidence with the GeV and TeV flare, although the overall optical flux in 2014 was approximately two times brighter than in previous years.  \(v) Non-detections by [SWIFT]{}-BAT[^1] (15-50keV) and MAXI[^2] (4-10keV) on the day of the TeV flare (MJD 56696) can be interpreted as a limit on the hard X-ray flux of the order of ergcms . This effectively limits the peak synchrotron luminosity to  \(vi) No change in the 15GHz radio brightness of 2 was seen in the OVRO light curves in coincidence or after the TeV flare.[^3] 2 is in fact in the lower third of the OVRO sample in terms of radio flux variability .  \(vii) [SWIFT]{}-XRT data taken 24h after the flare showed an X-ray flux comparable with historical average values , although the TeV flux was back to a quiescent level at that point.  A lower limit on can be derived by estimating the required Doppler boosting for gamma rays with energy to escape pair production on a co-spatial synchrotron photon field with density , where . For photons with TeV measured by VERITAS the mean interaction energy for pair production is eV. Using the expression for optical depth from , imposing , and estimating from the [SWIFT]{}-XRT and UVOT measurements described in Section   results in  where is the Thomson cross section and is the spectral index of the synchrotron emission around . We note that the [SWIFT]{} observations were made 24h after the TeV flare (Figure  ). The lower limit on is still valid, however, as long as the density of synchrotron photons was not lower during the flare than that measured on the subsequent day.  The spectral energy distribution (SED) of 2 during the flare is shown in Figure  . TeV emission can be explained by a fresh injection of relativistic electrons, where the injected perturbation propagates down in energy as the plasma cools, explaining the smaller amplitude of the GeV flare and the lack of optical variability . Taking the radio spectrum from and the R-band flux from the Tuorla observatory we derive a radio-to-optical spectral index . If the cooling break[^4] in the synchrotron SED happens beyond optical frequencies, as assumed in and and typically observed in BL Lac objects , determines the power-law spectral index () of the emitting electrons :  Beyond the cooling break, the electron distribution has to extend to Lorentz factors () of the order  to produce the TeV photons detected by VERITAS. In the simplest leptonic emission scenario, the high-energy component of the SED is produced via the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism . In an SSC scenario, the ratio between the synchrotron and inverse-Compton luminosities can be used to estimate the magnetic field. Following and using equations ( ) and ( ) to constrain and , we derive  The scarcity of multiwavelength coverage simultaneous with the TeV flare, specially of the synchrotron component, leaves numerical modeling of the SED underconstrained. However, even if modeling solutions are not unique, they can be used to understand the level of kinetic and magnetic jet power required under different scenarios. We test the feasibility of a SSC scenario by using the stationary leptonic model of , fixing the jet viewing angle to for simplicity. Models[^5] within the parameter constraints from equations ( – ) reproduce the measured gamma-ray luminosity without overproducing the optical flux measured by the Tuorla observatory, and keeping as constrained by the [SWIFT]{}-BAT non-detection (Figure  ). These solutions would indicate an emitting region where the kinetic power of relativistic electrons () exceeds the power carried by the magnetic field () by a factor of . This is typically the case in SSC modelling of TeV blazars . Higher values of would imply even higher ratios. Given the observational uncertainty in the shape of the synchrotron emission, we also explore a wider range of electron spectral indices than indicated in equation ( ), finding that is required to reproduce the hard GeV spectrum measured by .  The lack of observable thermal emission from the accretion disk and associated emission lines in 2 supports an SSC emission scenario. However, the observed Compton dominance () typically points to external Compton models to explain the high-energy emission. Assuming an EC scenario, constraints on and the distance of the energy dissipation region from the black hole () can be derived assuming reasonable limits on the jet collimation and luminosity of upscattered synchrotron photons. Following results in:  where the accretion disk luminosity () is assumed to be erg s and describes the composition of the external radiation fields. Equations ( ) and ( ) constrain the parameter space with a marginal solution at and cm that would place the emitting blob beyond the broad-line region. A numerical EC model[^6] with an external photon field described as blackbody emission with K typical of hot dust can reproduce the SED with (Figure  ).  Particle acceleration in relativistic shocks or through magnetic reconnection can explain the short flux-variability timescale observed in 2 . The hard electron spectrum () derived from the multiwavelength SED is usually obtained in semi-analytical calculations of relativistic shock acceleration , but more recent fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations derive significantly softer spectra . Magnetic reconnection events can produce harder electron spectra than those originating from shock acceleration , easily reproducing derived from the synchrotron spectrum of 2. Recently, have suggested that magnetic reconnection is a more viable scenario for particle acceleration in relativistic jets, disfavoring shock models for their inability to simultaneously dissipate energy and accelerate particles beyond thermal energies. Efficient magnetic reconnection requires an emitting region in rough equipartition between particles and magnetic field . The EC scenario presented above does fulfill this condition, while our attempts to describe the observed SED with SSC models persistently resulted in particle-dominated emitting regions where the magnetization of the plasma would be too low for efficient magnetic reconnection to take place.  VERITAS will continue to monitor 2. Events like the extreme flare of 2014 Feb 08 should be within the sensitivity reach of HAWC . Future observations will show how frequent these extreme gamma-ray flares are and whether or not they are present in the majority of TeV blazars.
