    <title>Cavity cooling of many atoms</title>
    <abstract>We demonstrate cavity cooling of all motional degrees of freedom of an
atomic ensemble using light that is far detuned from the atomic
transitions by several gigahertz. The cooling is achieved by
cavity-induced frequency-dependent asymmetric enhancement of the atomic
emission spectrum, thereby extracting thermal kinetic energy from the
atomic system. Within , the atomic temperature is reduced from to ,
where the final temperature is mainly limited by the linewidth of the
cavity. In principle, the technique can be applied to molecules and
atoms with complex internal energy structure. </abstract>

  <outline text="Rate equation" _note="The cooling force generated by the light scattered into the cavity mode is given by : where is the detuning of the scattered light relative to the cavity resonant frequency, is the wavevector of the incident light, and is the single-atom scattering rate into the cavity. The enhancement of the cavity scattering rate over free-space scattering rate is . Since the atoms are confined in the Lamb-Dicke regime along the cavity () direction, only the force in the direction is responsible for the cavity cooling process.  From the cooling force, we can calculate the rate at which thermal energy is removed from one atom: where is the thermal energy of individual atoms. The rate equation can be written as:  By redefining , we arrive at Eq. 1.">

  <outline text="Photon-photon correlation function" _note="For the light emitted from a large number of uncorrelated emitters, there is a simple relation between the first and second-order auto-correlation functions :  where is defined as  We consider atoms with a Doppler width . The electric field of the scattered light field can be written as where is the electric field amplitude scattered from an atom. The correlation function of the light scattered into the cavity mode is fit with Eqs.  -  to obtain the Doppler width. The relation between Doppler width and temperature in one dimension , , is used to extract the temperature of the atoms.">

  <outline text="Heterodyne measurement" _note="We interfere the emerging light from the cavity with a local oscillator 2 MHz detuned from the incident light on a beam splitter. The output light from two ports of the beamsplitter is collected using SPCM-AQRH Single Photon Counting Modules from Excelitas Technologies, and its Fourier transform is calculated to extract the power spectrum of the light exiting the cavity. The average frequency shift of the scattered light into the cavity relative to the incident light is a direct evidence of cavity cooling. Thermal energy is removed from individual atoms at a rate of , which equals the first term in the right hand side of Eq.  . The linewidth of the spectrum is a product of the Doppler emission spectrum of the atoms and the cavity transmission profile , where is the frequency of the incident light, is the cavity resonance frequency, and is the Doppler width of the atomic ensemble. The temperature extracted from the emission spectrum of the cavity scattering light agrees well with that obtained from the function.">

  <outline text="3D cooling with two cooling beams" _note="As discussed in the main text, in the weak-confinement regime, one cooling beam along the direction is generating a cooling force in the x-z plane, thereby realizing 2D cooling. Any second cooling beam not parallel to the axis will thus generate 3D cooling. Here we present the data when we simultaneously and continuously send light from the and direction and monitor the photon-photon correlation functions separately to extract the atomic temperatures in the two directions. The result shown in Fig.  shows a similar temperature reduction in both directions.  ">
