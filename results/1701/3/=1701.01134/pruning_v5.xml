    <title>Pruned cellular free resolutions of monomial ideals</title>
    <abstract>Using discrete Morse theory, we give an algorithm that prunes the excess
of information in the Taylor resolution and constructs a new cellular
free resolution for an arbitrary monomial ideal. The pruned resolution
is not simplicial in general, but we can slightly modify our algorithm
in order to obtain a simplicial resolution. We also show that the
Lyubeznik resolution fits into our pruning strategy. The pruned
resolution is not always minimal but it is a lot closer to the minimal
resolution than the Taylor and the Lyubeznik resolutions as we will see
in some examples. We finally use our methods to give a different
approach to the theory of splitting of monomial ideals. We deduce from
this splitting strategy that the pruned resolution is always minimal in
the case of cycles and paths. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Let be the polynomial ring over a field and a monomial ideal. The study of minimal free resolutions of these ideals has been a very active area of research during the last decades. There are topological and combinatorial formulae, as those of Hochster or Gasharov, Peeva and Welker , to describe their multigraded Betti numbers but, except for some specific classes of monomial ideals (see, e.g., , or ), the problem of describing a minimal multigraded free resolution explicitly was shown to be difficult.  Another strategy is to study non-minimal free resolutions. These reveal less information than minimal free resolutions do but are often much easier to describe. The most significant ones are the Taylor resolution and the Lyubeznik resolution . An interesting feature of these two resolutions is that they fit in the theory of simplicial resolutions introduced by Bayer, Peeva and Sturmfels in and further extended to regular cellular resolutions and CW-resolutions in and respectively. The idea behind these three concepts is to associate to a free resolution of a monomial ideal a simplicial complex (respectively a regular cell complex, a CW-complex) that carries in its structure the algebraic structure of the free resolution. It is worth pointing out that Velasco proved in that there exist monomial ideals whose minimal free resolutions cannot be described by a CW-complex.  By adapting the discrete Morse theory developed by Forman and Chari , Batzies and Welker provided in a method to reduce a given regular cellular resolution. In particular, they proved that the Lyubeznik resolution can be obtained in this way from the Taylor resolution. Let’s point out that discrete Morse theory has the inconvenient that it can’t be used iteratively. To overcome this issue, one can use the algebraic discrete Morse theory developed independently by Sköldberg and Jöllenbeck and Welker . In this work, we use a similar strategy to reduce the Taylor resolution and obtain cellular and simplicial free resolutions that are closer to the minimal one than the Lyubeznik resolution. Essentially, the information given by the Taylor resolution can be encoded in a directed graph and the obstruction to its minimality can be observed in some of the edges of this graph. What we will do is to remove, in a convenient order, some of these edges to provide a smaller resolution. In some sense, we are pruning the excess of information given by the Taylor resolution in a simple and efficient way.  The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section  , we review the notion of cellular resolution and introduce the basics on discrete Morse theory that will be needed throughout this work. In Section  , we present our main results. We first provide an algorithm (Algorithm  ) that, starting from the Taylor resolution of a monomial ideal, allows to construct a smaller cellular free resolution (Theorem   and Corollary  ). The resolution that we obtain is not simplicial in general, but we can adapt our pruning algorithm to produce a simplicial free resolution (Algorithm  ). Indeed, the Lyubeznik resolution fits into this pruning strategy as shown in Algorithm  . Other variants of our method are also mentioned.  In Section  , we illustrate our results with several examples. We implemented our algorithms using CoCoALib for constructing pruned resolutions in the non-trivial examples contained in this section. Finally, in Section   we present a connection between our method and the theory of Betti splittings introduced by Eliahou and Kervaire and later developed by Francisco, Hà and Van Tuyl . We provide a sufficient condition for having a Betti splitting by checking some prunings in our algorithm. We use this approach to prove that the pruned resolution is minimal for edge ideals associated to paths and cycles.">

  <outline text="Discrete Morse theory" _note="Forman introduced in the discrete Morse theory as a method to reduce the number of cells in a CW-complex without changing its homotopy type. Batzies and Welker adapted this technique in to the study of cellular resolutions; see also . Indeed, they used the reformulation of discrete Morse theory in terms of acyclic matchings given by Chari in in order to obtain, given a regular cellular resolution (most notably the Taylor resolution), a reduced cellular resolution.  This is also our approach in this work. Let’s start recalling from the preliminaries on discrete Morse theory. Consider the directed graph on the set of cells of a regular -graded CW-complex which edges are given by For a given set of edges , denote by the graph obtained by reversing the direction of the edges in , i.e., the directed graph with edges[^1] When each cell of occurs in at most one edge of , we say that is a [MATCHING]{} on . A matching is [ACYCLIC]{} if the associated graph is acyclic, i.e., does not contain any directed cycle. Given an acyclic matching on , the -[CRITICAL CELLS]{} of are the cells of that are not contained in any edge of . Finally, an acyclic matching is [HOMOGENEOUS]{} whenever for any edge .  Let be a regular -graded CW-complex and a homogeneous acyclic matching. Then, there is a [(]{}not necessarily regular[)]{} CW-complex whose -cells are in one-to-one correspondence with the -critical -cells of , such that is homotopically equivalent to , and that inherits the -graded structure.  In the theory of cellular resolutions, we have the following consequence.  Let be a monomial ideal. Assume that is a regular -graded CW-complex that defines a cellular resolution of . Then, for a homogeneous acyclic matching on , the -graded CW-complex supports a cellular resolution of .  The differentials of the cellular resolution can be explicitely described in terms of the differentials of (see ).

  <outline text="Algebraic discrete Morse theory" _note="One of the main inconvenients of discrete Morse theory is that the CW-complex that we obtain for a given homogeneous acyclic matching is not necessarily regular. Therefore, we cannot always iterate the procedure. To overcome such an obstacle, one may use [ALGEBRAIC DISCRETE MORSE THEORY]{} developed independently by Sköldberg and Jöllenbeck and Welker .  This approach works directly with an initial free resolution without paying attention whether it has or not a cellular structure. Given a basis of the corresponding free modules , we may consider the directed graph on the set of basis elements with the corresponding set of edges . Then, we may follow the same constructions as in the previous subsection. Namely, we may define an acyclic matching (see ) but, in this case, we have to make sure that the coefficient in the differential corresponding to an edge is a unit.

In this section, we use a similar approach to provide some new cellular free resolutions for monomial ideals. We should point out that the framework considered in is slightly more general. To keep notations as simple as possible, we decided to stick to the case of monomial ideals in a polynomial ring.">
  <outline text="A cellular free resolution" _note="Let be a monomial ideal. Our starting point is the Taylor resolution . This resolution is, in general, far from being minimal. In other words, the directed graph associated to contains a lot of unnecessary information. Our goal is to prune this excess of information in a very simple way. More precisely, we give an algorithm that produces a homogeneous acyclic matching on . Using discrete Morse theory, this will provide a cellular free resolution of . It will not be minimal in general, but it will be smaller than the Lyubeznik resolution.    [ (Pruned resolution)]{}  [Input:]{} The set of edges .

For the case we can visualize the steps of the algorithm over the directed graph as follows:  -2cm[ .41cm .41cm ]{}  The double arrows indicate the direction of the pruning step, that is, the arrows that will be pruned at each step if the degree of their two vertices coincide (and if they have not been pruned at a previous step).  The main result in this section is the following:    Let be the set of pruned edges obtained using Algorithm  . Then is a homogeneous acyclic matching on .  As a consequence, we get our desired cellular free resolution.    Let be a monomial ideal and be the set of pruned edges obtained using Algorithm  . Then, the -graded CW-complex supports a cellular free resolution of .  The free resolution , like the Lyubeznik resolution, strongly depends on the order of the generators of the monomial ideal . In general, it is neither simplicial (while the Lyubeznik resolution is always simplicial) nor minimal.  The proof of Theorem   follows closely the one given in to show that the Lyubeznik resolution can be obtained using discrete Morse theory. However, we will need some reformulation of their preliminary results.  Let’s start with some notations. Given , we define:  Of course, implies . It follows that is the step in the algorithm where the edge containing , namely , is pruned. Note that we may have . For simplicity, we will set when no edge containing has been pruned in the algorithm.  The following properties will be useful in the proof of Theorem  :  If for some s.t. , then .  The result obviously holds if . When , the result follows from the fact that implies .  If and for some s.t. , then .  We have so it follows that and therefore . On the other hand, we also have the equality so and the reverse inequality follows.  If , then .  Assume that . Then we have by definition. To prove the reverse inequality we only have to notice that and equivalently . Using similar arguments we also obtain when .  [OF THEOREM  .]{} It is clear from its construction that the set is a matching since we are removing edges (or pairs of cells) at each step of the algorithm. To check that it is acyclic, assume that we have a cycle Then , and hence equality must hold everywhere. Let’s see that we also have .  We start considering the case of a reversed arrow , where . We have by iii) so, by ii), we also have .  For a direct arrow we have for some . We have were the first inequality is due to the fact that the vertex must be pruned in the next link of the chain. The second inequality comes from i) and it can not be strict because of the definition of . Therefore and we have by ii), that is, .  Since all the elements in the cycle have the same , we deduce that such cycle cannot exist due to the fact that we can only go in the direction of when constructing the edges of the cycle. At the end, we would have an edge with both directions and we get a contradiction.  This shows that is an acyclic matching on , and it is homogeneous by construction of in our pruning algorithm.  A nice feature about the pruning algorithm is that we do not need to care if the original system of generators of the monomial ideal is minimal or not. Roughly speaking, the pruning algorithm will always remove the excess of information given by the extra generators.    Let be a monomial ideal, and let be its minimal set of generators with . Let and be the Taylor simplicial complexes associated to these two sets of generators[^2] and , be the sets of pruned edges obtained by applying Algorithm   to each case. Then, there is an isomorphism of -graded CW-complexes . In particular, both sets of generators lead to the same cellular free resolution of in Corollary  .  Assume that is a generator of that does not belong to the minimal generating set . We want to check that all the vertices with in the graph associated to the Taylor complex are pruned using Algorithm  .  There exists a minimal generator such that . Therefore, at the step of Algorithm  , we prune all the edges with and that have survived in the previous steps. But if we have pruned, at a previous step of the algorithm, the edge , then we have also pruned the edge at the same step and hence neither the vertex nor the vertex survived at the step of the algorithm.

Indeed, we will compare the pruned resolution to the simplicial free resolution obtained in Section   and to the Lyubeznik resolution by means of their corresponding Betti diagram.">
  <outline text="First examples" _note="Already for some simple examples we can appreciate the better behavior of the pruned resolutions with respect to the Lyubeznik resolution.    We are going to describe the steps of the pruning Algorithms described in Section   for the edge ideals associated to a -path and a -cycle:   Let be the edge ideal of a -path. The steps performed with Algorithm   are the following:   [**Step (1):**]{} No edge is pruned.   [**Step (2):**]{} We prune the edges and .   [**Step (3):**]{} We prune the edge .   [**Step (4):**]{} No edge is pruned.  The two edges pruned in Step (2) are also pruned using Algorithm   but are not pruned using Algorithm  . The edge pruned in Step (3) is not be pruned neither using Algorithm   nor Algorithm  . Therefore, the Betti diagrams of the pruned, the simplicial pruned, and the Lyubeznik resolutions are respectively:  [ ]{}  The pruned resolution is minimal. The simplicial pruned resolution is not minimal but it is as small as possible since the ideal has no minimal simplicial resolution as one can check using an argument similar to the one used in for the 4-cycle. The Lyubeznik resolution coincides with the Taylor resolution since no edge has been pruned through Algorithm  .   Let be the edge ideal of a -cycle. The steps performed with Algorithm   are the following:   [**Step (1):**]{} We prune four edges , , and .   [**Step (2):**]{} We prune and .   [**Step (3):**]{} We prune the edge .   [**Step (4):**]{} We prune and .   [**Step (5):**]{} We prune the edge .  The edges pruned at Step (1) are also pruned using Algorithm   and Algorithm  . The two edges pruned at Step (2) can not be pruned using Algorithm   because the vertices and remain at this step of the algorithm. The edges pruned at Step (3) and (4) are also pruned in Algorithm  . The edge pruned at Step (5) is not pruned in Algorithm  . Notice that the two edges that prohibited the pruning at Step (3) of Algorithm   were pruned at Step (4). This means that we can perform another round of Algorithm   that will prune the two edges that could not be pruned before at step (2) as observed in Remark  .  On the other hand, note that after the first step, no more edge can be pruned through Algorithm  . We thus obtain that the Betti diagrams of the pruned, the simplicial pruned, and the Lyubeznik resolutions are the following respectively:  [ ]{}  As in the previous example, the pruned resolution is minimal and the simplicial pruned resolution is not minimal but it is as small as possible.  It is not surprising that in the previous examples we could find a cellular minimal resolution since both the 5-path and the 5-cycle fall into .

  <outline text="Independence on the characteristic of the base field" _note="It is well-known that the Betti numbers of a monomial ideal depend on the characteristic of the base field. This phenomenon can be understood through Hochster’s formula. Namely, given a monomial ideal , we may assume that it is squarefree since its Betti numbers can always be obtained from a squarefree monomial ideal using polarization. Now, a squarefree monomial ideal is always the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a simplicial complex . For any squarefree degree , we consider . Let be the simplicial complex obtained by taking all the faces of whose vertices belong to . Hochster’s formula states that the Betti numbers of can be computed as the dimensions of reduced simplicial homology groups: By the universal coefficient theorem, we may just compute the homology modules over the integer numbers . It follows that Betti numbers depend on the characteristic of the base field whenever these homology groups have torsion.    The most recurrent example that illustrates the behavior of Betti numbers with respect to the characteristic of the base field is the Stanley-Reisner ideal associated to a minimal triangulation of . Namely, consider the following ideal in : The Betti diagrams in characteristic zero and two respectively are  [ ]{}  On the other hand, the results that we obtain with the pruned and the Lyubeznik resolution respectively are:  [ ]{}  All the free resolutions that we consider in this work are obtained from the Taylor resolution using discrete Morse theory as in or .

Betti splitting techniques can be used to provide a recursive method to compute Betti numbers of monomial ideals. For example, the case of edge ideals of graphs has been successfully studied in and where they considered [SPLITTING EDGES]{} and [SPLITTING VERTICES]{}. Splitting edges are easy to describe (see ) but, in general they are difficult to find. On the other hand, every vertex is a splitting vertex except for some limit cases where the vertex is isolated or its complement consists of isolated vertices.  One can also check that any vertex also provides a pruned Betti splitting. Indeed, let be the edge ideal of a graph on vertices. Consider a vertex, say , and the decomposition where is the edge ideal of the graph obtained from by removing the vertex and all the edges passing through this vertex. Notice that is the edge ideal of a bipartite graph where is the number of vertices adjacent to in . We have a pruned Betti splitting because the ideal does not involve the variable and the pruning steps of the algorithm are performed within and separately. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that the pruning algorithm provides a minimal free resolution for , and hence In particular, if Algorithm   provides a minimal free resolution for and , then it is also provides a minimal free resolution for .  For paths and cycles, we can use these splitting techniques to prove that the pruning algorithm will always provide a minimal free resolution as we already observed in Example   for the -path and the -cycle. The Betti numbers of these ideals have already been computed by Jacques in .    Let be the edge ideal of an -path. A decomposition with and is a pruned Betti splitting simply because the ideal does not involve the vertex . Therefore we have Indeed, this is a Betti splitting and the pruning algorithm provides a minimal free resolution, thus By induction, we get a minimal free resolution for the ideals and so we only have to control the intersection in order to get the desired result. Recall that, using Lemma  , we only have to consider a minimal set of generators. In our case we have If we consider the decomposition , we have a Betti splitting. Namely, the pruning algorithm applied on the ideals and is equivalent to the one given for the path , and we are done by induction.  Let be the edge ideal of an -cycle.

Namely, consider with and . Since and are the ideal of an -path and a -path respectively, the pruning algorithm provides a minimal free resolution as shown in Example  . Therefore we have:  A minimal set of generators of is We have a pruned Betti splitting given by . The pruning algorithm gives a minimal free resolution for the ideals and as we have seen when dealing with the case of paths. A minimal set of generators for the intersection is but the pruning algorithm applied to this ideal is equivalent to the one for the cycle , and we are done by induction.  [23]{}  J. Abbot and A.
