<outline text="Pressure Sensor Data" _note="The dataset taken up for this research is taken from our previous work , which consists of the step samples of 13 people who walk on a pressure sensitive matrix. Each person in each walking sequence records 2-3 steps. A minimum of 12 such samples is recorded for each person. The demography of participants varies in terms of height, weight, and shoe-size from 155-195 (in cm), 64-100 (in Kg), and 37-45 (European size) respectively. This accounts for the high variance in the recorded data. Each walking sequence is an individual data sequence, labeled with a specific person ID which defines the class label for the CNN. Overall, 529 steps are recorded.">
