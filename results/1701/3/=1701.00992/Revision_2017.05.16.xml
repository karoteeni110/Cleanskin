    <title>Viscous displacement in porous media:\
the Muskat problem in 2D</title>
    <abstract>We consider the Muskat problem describing the viscous displacement in a
two-phase fluid system located in an unbounded two-dimensional porous
medium or Hele-Shaw cell. formulating the mathematical model as an
evolution problem for the sharp interface between the fluids, we show
that Muskat problem with surface tension is a quasilinear parabolic
problem, whereas, in the absence of surface tension effects, the
Rayleigh-Taylor condition identifies a domain of parabolicity for the
fully nonlinear problem. Based upon these aspects, we then establish the
local well-posedness for arbitrary large initial data in , , if surface
tension is taken into account, respectively for arbitrary large initial
data in that additionally satisfy the Rayleigh-Taylor condition if
surface tension effects are neglected. We also show that the problem
exhibits the parabolic smoothing effect and we provide criteria for the
global existence of solutions. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction and main results" _note="The Muskat problem is a model proposed by M. Muskat in to describe the encroachment of water into an oil sand. This problem is related to the secondary phase of the oil extraction process where water injection is sometimes used to increase the pressure in the oil reservoir and to drive the oil towards the extraction well. In this paper we consider an unbounded fluid system, consisting of two immiscible and incompressible fluid phases, which moves with constant speed , either in a horizontal or a vertical Hele-Shaw cell (or a homogeneous porous medium). Furthermore, we assume that the flows are two-dimensional and that the velocities are asymptotically equal to far away from the origin. In a reference frame which moves with the same speed as the fluids and in the same direction, the Muskat problem can be formulated as an evolution problem for the pair , where is a parametrization for the sharp interface that separates the fluids, with asymptotically flat for large , and is the jump of the velocity at the free interface in tangential direction (see ). Mathematically, we are confronted with the following evolution problem    where and are additionally coupled through the following relation for and .  We denote by the spatial derivative is the Earth’s gravity, is the permeability of the homogeneous porous medium, is the surface tension coefficient at the free boundary, is the density and the viscosity of the fluid located at , where Moreover, is the curvature of the graph and denotes the principal value which, depending on the regularity of the functions under the integral, is taken at zero and/or infinity. If is positive, then the fluid expends into the region occupied by the fluid and vice versa, if is negative, then the fluid expends into the region occupied by the fluid (see Section   for rigorous a derivation of ). When neglecting surface tension effects we set and we require that the first equation of and the equation hold also at .  In the recent years the Muskat problem has received, due to its physical relevance, much attention especially in the field of applied mathematics. In the absence of surface tension effects the local existence of solutions has been first addressed by F. Yi in under the assumption that the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds. The Rayleigh-Taylor condition is a sign restriction on the jump of the pressure gradients in normal direction at the interface , and it reads where is the pressure of the fluid and the outward normal at with respect to . Thereafter, questions related to the well-posedness of the Muskat problem and other qualitative aspects of the dynamics have been studied in in several physical scenarios and with various methods. These references show the Rayleigh-Taylor condition is crucial in the analysis of this problem. In the regime where the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds with reverse inequality sign, for example if a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one, or when a more dense fluid sits on top of a less dense one, physical experiments evidence the occurrence of viscous fingering, cf. , and the Muskat problem is ill-posed, cf. e.g. . On the other hand, it was recently shown in , in a bounded and periodic striplike geometry, that the Rayleigh-Taylor condition actually identifies a domain of parabolicity for the Muskat problem.  When surface tension effects are taken into consideration, it was proven in , in bounded geometries, that the Muskat problem is a quasilinear parabolic problem for arbitrary large initial data, without any kind of restrictions. Also in this setting, the solvability of the problem has been addressed in several physical scenarios with quite intricate methods .  The first goal of this paper is to prove that the classical formulation of the Muskat problem, see Section  , is equivalent to the evolution problem , cf. Proposition  .  Our second goal is to extend the methods that have been recently applied in , in the particular case of fluids with equal viscosities, to the general case considered herein in order to establish the local well-posedness for the Muskat problem with and without surface tension by similar strategies and in a very general context. If the fluids have equal viscosities, the equation determines as a function of , and becomes an evolution problem for only. Surprisingly, the analysis in shows that the corresponding evolution problem is of quasilinear parabolic type in both regimes, that is for , or when and the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds. However, for , the equation is implicit and this fact enhances the nonlinear and nonlocal character of the problem and makes the analysis more involved. In the case when and the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds, the well-posedness of the problem is still an open question. Local existence of solutions to has been first addressed in for arbitrary large data in , and in three space dimensions in for initial data in . Global existence is established in in the periodic case and for small initial data. Quite recently, the authors of have proven the existence and uniqueness of solutions which satisfy an additional energy estimate for initial data in which are small with respect to some -norm. In Theorem   we show that the Muskat problem without surface tension is well-posed for arbitrary large initial data in . To achieve this result we formulate as a fully nonlinear evolution problem for and we prove that the set of initial data for which the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds defines, also in this geometry, a domain of parabolicity for the Muskat problem. It is worth emphasizing that the quasilinear character, present for , is not preserved when and this makes the Muskat problem without surface tension more difficult to handle.  For , the local well-posedness of has been addressed in for initial data in , with (see also for a global existence result for small initial data in , with ). Exploiting the quasilinear structure of the curvature term, we show that in this regime can be formulated as a quasilinear parabolic evolution problem. This property enables us to establish the local well-posedness of for arbitrary large initial in , with , cf. Theorem  . In particular, we may chose the initial data such that the curvature is unbounded or discontinuous.  Moreover, we show that the Muskat problem features the effect of parabolic smoothing: solutions (which possess additional regularity when ) become instantly real-analytic in the time-space domain. Besides, we provide criteria for the global existence of solutions.  The first main result of this paper is the following theorem.    Let . The problem possesses for each , a unique maximal solution with , and defines a semiflow on . Additionally, if then . Moreover, given , it holds that In particular, is real-analytic for each  We emphasize that exactly the same result as in Theorem   has been achieved in in the simpler case of fluids with equal viscosities.  When surface tension is neglected, that is , we assume that The situation when is special, because in this case the problem possesses for each , with , a unique global solution for all , cf. Section  . The corresponding flow is stationary with constant velocities equal to and hydrostatic pressures.  In order to discuss the well-posedness of with , we introduce the set of initial data for which the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds as The Rayleigh-Taylor condition is reformulated later on, cf. , where it is also proven that is an open subset of . Our analysis in Section   shows that is nonempty if and only if The relation is the classical condition found within the linear theory by Saffman and Taylor . In particular, if the flow takes place in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell and , then the less dense fluid lies above. For flows in horizontal Hele-Shaw cells the effects due to gravity are usually neglected, that is , and implies that and that the more viscous fluid expends into the region occupied by the less viscous one.  We now come to the second main result of this paper.    Let , [^1], and assume that holds. Given , the problem possesses a solution for some and an arbitrary . It further holds:   is the unique solution to belonging to   may be extended to a maximally defined solution for all , where  The solution map defines a semiflow on which is real-analytic in the open set ;  If is uniformly continuous for all , then either  If for some and , then  Given and a Banach space , we let   denote the Banach space of all bounded functions form   into , and, given we set  With respect to we add the following comments. Firstly, as shown in in the case when , there exist solutions which are not uniformly continuous in , in the sense that their slope blows up in finite time. Secondly, there exist global solutions to , cf. (see also ) or (in the periodic setting). Lastly, the existence of solutions which are uniformly bounded in and violate the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition at time is, to the best of our knowledge, an open issue.  The condition that for some imposed at is a technical assumption. Nevertheless, if our arguments can be extended to show that Theorem   still holds true if we replace by and by for possibly with a smaller maximal existence time . Hence, for solutions that start in , the property required at is satisfied for all and all This additional regularity is needed for our argument because the uniqueness property in Theorem   holds only for solutions that additionally belong to the space , for some , and this space is not sufficiently flexible with respect to the parameter trick used in the proof of Theorem  .  [^1]: Theorem   is still valid when however in this case its     assertions can be improved, cf. .">

<outline text="The governing equations and the equivalence result" _note="We start by presenting the classical formulation of the Muskat problem introduced in Section  . First of all, both fluids are taken to be incompressible, immiscible, and of Newtonian type. Since flows in porous media or Hele-Shaw cells occur at low Reynolds numbers, they are usually modeled as being two-dimensional and Darcy’s law is used instead of the conservation of momentum equation . Hence, the equations of motion in the fluid layers are[^1]    with denoting the velocity of the fluid These equations are supplemented by the natural boundary conditions on the free surface where is the unit normal at pointing into and the Euclidean inner product on . Furthermore, we impose the following far-field boundary conditions The motion of the interface is coupled to that of the fluids through the kinematic boundary condition and the interface at time is assumed to be known  We now rewrite the classical formulation of the Muskat problem in a coordinates system which moves with the same speed and in the same direction as the fluid system. To this end we introduce It is not difficult to see that the equations are equivalent to the following system of equations which has as unknowns  Before stating the equivalence result, cf. Proposition  , we first give a preparatory lemma, which is needed in the proof of Proposition   and also later on in the analysis (see the proof of Theorem  ). The proof of Lemma   is based on classical arguments used to establish the Plemelj formula and the Privalov theorem for Cauchy-type integrals defined on regular curves, see e.g. , and on the Lemmas  - . Details of the proof can be found, in a particular case, in .   Given and , we define Let further , , and .

Proposition  , that for , the equation has a unique solution , provided that the left-hand side of belongs to . If , the latter requirement implies that in fact is needed. Thanks to the parabolic smoothing in Theorem  , this additional regularity is inherited by all solutions. This is one of the reasons, besides the difference in nonlinear behavior, why we separate in Proposition   the cases and .    Let be given.  Let .

Stokes’ theorem and the second equation of show that the vorticity defined by the global velocity field is supported on the free boundary, that is where  We now claim that the velocity is given by the Biot-Savart law, that is in , where is defined in and in . Indeed, according to Plemelj formula, cf. e.g. , the limits and of at when we approach this point from above the interface or from below, respectively, are Moreover, the restrictions of to belong to , they satisfy the first, third, sixth equation of , and in .

Keeping in mind, we compute that where While follows from the chain rule, the relation can be easily derived with the help of Lemma  . In order to establish the generator property for , we proceed in the same way as in Section  , but now the situation is much more involved. To begin, we consider a continuous path with and where is a further continuous path The relations - and show that while, in view of and of , it holds that with denoting the Hilbert transform again. The term on the right-hand side of which has as a multiplying factor has been introduced artificially. Due to this trick, we are able for example to write, when setting , the function as a multiplicative term in the argument of in . Moreover, this artificial term provides some useful cancellations in the proof of Theorem   which are, together with our assumption , an important ingredient when establishing the generator property for , see Lemma   and Theorem  .  We note that the operator defined in can be estimated in a similar manner as the Fréchet derivative , that is there exists a constant such that for all and all . Additionally, recalling and , the Lemmas  - , in particular the estimate , lead us to the following relation where the lower order terms are encompassed by the term and for all and all .  The following theorem lies at the core of our generator result in Theorem  , and its assertion is independent of whether holds or not. Before stating the result, we point out that where is the Fourier multiplier with symbol    Let and be given. Then, there exist , a finite -localization family , a constant , and for each and there exist bounded operators such that for all , and . The operators are defined by where , and , respectively  Let be a finite -localization family and be an associated family, with to be fixed later on. As before, we denote by constants which are independent of (and, of course, of , , and ), and the constants denoted by may depend only upon  [STEP 1: THE LOWER ORDER TERMS.]{} Recalling Lemma  , , , , and exploiting the embedding we find that Moreover, differentiating the relations and once, it follows from , , and the Lemmas  -  that with Hence, we are left to estimate the -norm of the leading order term and this is performed below in several steps.  [STEP 2.]{} Given , we let ), be the operators defined by with We prove in this step that for all and , provided that is sufficiently small.  Since , for sufficiently small we have  The arguments used to estimate the remaining three terms in are similar, and therefore we only present in detail those for the first term. To begin, we write where The term can be estimate in the same way as the term in the proof of Theorem  . Indeed, integration by parts together with Lemma   yields for all .  Concerning we appeal to and write and, since on , we further have where and In this formula we denote by the translation -group on introduced in Lemma  . Integrating by parts, we get Furthermore, the arguments used to derive estimate lead us to provided that is sufficiently small. Hence, for sufficiently small and it holds that Finally, since we get provided that is sufficiently small, and together with and we obtain Since the other two terms in can be estimated in the same way, we conclude, in view of , that is satisfied.  [STEP 3.]{} Given , we let Moreover, for each , and we let denote the operator where and We next prove that for all , and , provided that is chosen sufficiently small. We begin by observing that and therefore We now decompose where The arguments used to derive combined with imply that and we are left to estimate To this end we compute for that where are defined in . Moreover, recalling , it follows that for , where Integrating by parts, Lemma   leads us to In view of , we deduce from , , and - that and yields, for sufficiently small, that  Invoking , the arguments used to deduce show that for all , provided that is sufficiently small.  Concerning the last term , we first recall that , cf. , and therewith we get  Using the latter relation together with the definition of , it follows that Furthermore, and lead us to the following identity In order to estimate the first term on the right-hand side of we rely on the property that The next three terms are of the same type as those estimated in [STEP 2]{} above, while each of the last two expressions can be written as a sum of two terms for which we can use the arguments that led to and . Altogether, we obtain for all , provided that is sufficiently small. In we denote by the positive constant which appears in . Hence, recalling , we get The estimate follows now from , , and .  [STEP 4.]{} Gathering , , , and , we conclude that the estimate holds for provided that Exploiting the fact that is the solution to the equation , it follows at once that is satisfied. This completes the proof of for  [STEP 5.]{} We are left to prove for This estimate follows by combining arguments from the previous steps with those presented in the second part of the proof of Theorem  , and therefore we omit the lengthy details.  We now reconsider the Fourier multipliers found in Theorem   and we notice that if is chosen such that the Rayleigh-Taylor condition holds, then there exists a constant with the property that Moreover, letting , with and , denote the Fourier multiplier we may find, similarly as in , a constant such that for all , with , and .  In order to establish the desired generation result for , we next show that the operator , with defined in , is invertible for large . In contrast to the analysis in Section  , where the invertibility of the translation , with , follows easily from the fact that this operator is a Fourier multiplier, cf. Theorem  , a more involved analysis is required in order to establish the invertibility of .    Given and , let and assume that Then, there exists such that for all .  We introduce the continuous path , where and we prove that there exist constants and with the property that for all , and . Having established , the method of continuity together with and the observation that is an invertible Fourier multiplier (the symbol of is , ) yields the desired claim.  We first prove that, given , there exists a finite -localization family , a constant , and for each and there exist bounded operators such that for all , and . The operators are defined by with , respectively Indeed, for we obtain by using integration by parts that and holds for , if is sufficiently small. Similarly, and, since vanishes at infinity, we see that holds also for , provided that is sufficiently small.  Since for some , we may find a constant such that for all , , and . Choosing in , it follows from that for all , , and we have and, summing over , we conclude together with Young’s inequality and Remark   that there exist positive constants and such that holds for all , and .  We are now in the position to establish the desired generator property. To this end we recall from that the set introduced in Section   is actually given by and we note that the continuity of the mappings ensure that is an open subset of    Given , it holds that  The proof follows from Theorem  , the relation , Remark  , and Lemma  , by arguing as in the proof of Theorem  .  Finally, we arrive at the proof our second main result.  Since for the problem is equivalent to , the existence and uniqueness of a maximal solution to , for each , follows from . We note that the relation together with Theorem   ensures that all the assumptions of are satisfied. Furthermore, follows from , and from .  In order to prove , we assume that for some and Given , which we view below as parameters in an associated nonlinear evolution problem, we define the function Since , cf. Theorem   , our assumption together with the translation invariance of implies that Therefore, the function is a solution to the nonlinear evolution problem for the initial data , where denotes the operator Recalling , we get . Moreover, given , the Fréchet derivative of with respect to is given by Since is a Fourier multiplier of first order with purely imaginary symbol, we may revisit the computations in Theorem  , Lemma  , and Theorem  , to deduce that belongs to for all According to , the problem possesses for each a unique maximal solution (that satisfies similar properties as in Theorem   ), the set is open and Hence, for our special initial data , it follows due to that , and moreover for all . Given , we choose such that for all belonging to the disc . Hence, we conclude that in particular is a real-analytic map. The conclusion is now immediate, see e.g. the proof of .
