    <title>On the discrepancy between best and uniform approximation</title>
    <abstract>For a transcendental real number, we consider the classical Diophantine
exponents and . They measure how small can be for an integer polynomial
of degree at most and naive height bounded by , for arbitrarily large
and all large , respectively. The discrepancy between the exponents and
has attracted interest recently. Studying parametric geometry of
numbers, W. Schmidt and L. Summerer were the first to refine the trivial
inequality . Y. Bugeaud and the author found another estimation provided
that the condition holds. In this paper we establish an unconditional
version of the latter result, which can be regarded as a proper
extension. Unfortunately, the new contribution involves an additional
exponent and is of interest only in certain cases. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Let be a positive integer and be a transcendental real number. For a polynomial as usual let denote its height, which is the maximum modulus among the coefficients of . We want to investigate relations between the two classical exponents of Diophantine approximation and introduced below. Define as the supremum of such that has a solution of degree at most for arbitrarily large values of . Similarly, let be the supremum of such that has a solution of degree at most for [ALL]{} large . The interest of the exponent in and the derived exponents arises partly from the relation to approximation to a real number by algebraic numbers of bounded degree. Indeed, when is an algebraic number very close to , then the evaluation is also very small by absolute value, for the irreducible minimal polynomial of over . More precisely for a constant that depends only on and the degree of . The converse is a delicate problem, at least for certain numbers , related to the famous problem of Wirsing posed in . We do not further discuss this issue here and only affirm that results involving the exponents typically imply comparable results concerning approximation by algebraic numbers in an obvious way. For any real number , our exponents clearly satisfy the relations Dirichlet’s box principle further implies The value can be infinity. In this case is called a -number, more precisely is called -number if is the smallest such index. The existence of -numbers for any was first proved by LeVeque . On the other hand, the quantities can be effectively bounded. For , it is not hard to see that we always have , see . For , Davenport and Schmidt  showed Roy  proved that for certain numbers he called [EXTREMAL NUMBERS]{} there is equality, so is sharp. For an overview of the results on the values attained for real , see . For , little is known about the exponents . The supremum of the values over all real real numbers remains unknown in this case, in fact even the existence of a real number with the property is open. The first result in this direction was due to Davenport and Schmidt , who showed for any real . Recently this bound has been refined in and further in , in the latter paper the currently best known bound was established. The right hand side is of order as . Conditionally on a conjecture of Schmidt and Summerer , small improvements of can be obtained with the method in . In particular for it would imply , see .">

  <outline text="The main result" _note="Investigating parametric geometry of numbers introduced by them, Schmidt and Summerer  found the estimate for the minimum discrepancy between and , for any transcendental real . Rearrangements lead to the equivalent formulation In fact analogous estimates were established in the more general context of linear forms with respect to any given real vector that is -linearly independent together with , and in this case they are sharp for any dimension and parameter, see Roy . The above estimates yield a proper improvement of the obvious left inequality in unless . A non-trivial identity case occurs for and an extremal number as defined in Section  . See also for an improvement of when , and a conjecture concerning the optimal bound for arbitrary . A special case of the recent  complements .      Let be integers and be a transcendental real number. Then in case of we have  Observe that in contrast to , the bound in for decreases as increases. For and any Sturmian continued fraction, see  for a definition, there is equality in . This can be verified by inserting the exact values of and determined in the main result of . In particular, for extremal numbers mentioned above we have equality in both and when .  The condition in Theorem   was used predominately to guarantee that the polynomials in the definition of have degree precisely (in the special case of   reproduced in Theorem  ). In other words, for any , there are arbitrarily large irreducible integer polynomials of degree exactly for which the estimate holds. This was a crucial observation for the proof. We point out that this property does not hold in general, i.e. when we drop the condition . Indeed, using continued fraction expansion, one can even construct real numbers for which the degree of any which satisfies equals one, when is sufficiently small. This can be deduced from the proof of . It is unknown whether still holds when we drop the condition . The purpose of this paper is to provide a weaker but unconditioned relation. We will agree on in our following main result.    Let be a positive integer and be a real transcendental number. Let be the smallest integer such that . Then the estimation holds.    In case of , the trivial estimate in implies . More generally, when does not exceed by much, the Schmidt-Summerer bound is even smaller than both bounds in .  The left bound in will be an easy consequence of Theorem   from reproduced below, the main new contribution is the right bound. When , by definition of we have and the right bound in the minimum in becomes , which is trivial in view of . Thus Theorem   is of interest primarily when and . However, if these relations hold and does not exceed by much, then one checks that the right expression in the minimum in is the smaller one. In general, the new right bound in is of interest when is rather close to and is relatively small, whereas is large. For , the bound in becomes , and we recover Theorem  . The expression involved in is unpleasant, as it can be arbitrarily close to . We would like to replace it by , which could be effectively bounded with by roughly . The proof will suggest that such improvements are realistic.">

  <outline text="-numbers" _note="The claim of Theorem   is of particular interest when is a -number (see Section  ). In that case, in  it was deduced essentially from the generalization  of Theorem   that , and moreover We remark that  rephrased in Theorem   below provides another proof of . We can now refine this estimate when is roughly between and .    Let be integers and be a -number. Then  By assumption we have , where we agree on if . Thus we may apply Theorem   with , which yields the claimed bound.  As indicated, the possible gain by the replacement of by in the minimum can only occur when is not too large compared to . More precisely is a necessary condition by . On the other hand, when is a -number and is small for some , then Corollary   yields a significant improvement for . It is reasonable that even -numbers with the property for exist. For this is true, using continued fraction expansion one can even construct a -number with any prescribed value . See  and its preceding remarks. However, for -numbers we do not get any new insight from Theorem  . Concerning -numbers of larger index, Alniaçik  showed the existence of uncountably many -numbers of arbitrary index with the property . (In  the analogous result for -numbers is proposed, however as pointed out by Bugeaud in  crucial estimates in  are not carried out properly and serious revision of the paper is required.) For such -numbers, the succeeding uniform exponent can be bounded with Corollary   as For large , this leads to a reasonable improvement compared to the trivial bound from . Moreover, Alniaçiks main theorem in  seems to allow one to construct -numbers with arbitrary prescribed value , thus extending the result for -numbers above. Indeed, it suffices to take (in fact rather in the classical notation of continued fractions where for the partial quotients and the convergents, this seems to be a minor inaccuracy in ) and let the remaining (i.e. not of the form ) in the formulation of the theorem. Elementary facts on continued fractions and Roth’s Theorem imply . Strangely, this observation seems not to have been previously mentioned. As soon as , the resulting bound again improves the trivial upper bound .  On the other hand, the larger intermediate exponents are hard to control for a -number. A construction of Schmidt  shows that it is possible to obtain simultaneously for for some -number . This refined an earlier result of Alniaçik, Avci and Bugeaud . However, this estimation is not sufficient to improve the previously known bound with Corollary  . Finally, we point out that -numbers which allow arbitrarily good irreducible polynomial evaluations of some degree as well satisfy . By the condition more precisely we mean that the exponent in can be chosen arbitrarily large among polynomials of degree and additionally among irreducible polynomials of degree . Indeed, the second expression in the right hand estimate in can be dropped in this case, as can be seen from the proof below.">

<outline text="Proof of Theorem [nn]" _note="We reproduce some results from  for the proof. The first is , which essentially implies the left bound in .    Let be positive integers and be a transcendental real number. Then  Theorem   was recently refined  by replacing the right hand side by , for the classic exponent of uniform simultaneous rational approximation to for a real number . See for example  for an exact definition. We will further directly apply the following , a generalization of  by Davenport and Schmidt, which was the core of the proof of both Theorem   and Theorem  . We write in the sequel when exceeds at most by a constant that depends on the subscript variables.    Let be two coprime integer polynomials of degree and , respectively. Further let be any real number. Then at least one of the estimates holds. In particular  In the formulation of the lemma we dropped the condition stated in , which is not required as pointed out to me by D. Roy. We further point out that Wirsing  showed that for any there exists a constant , such that uniformly for all polynomials of degree at most holds. He deduced that the polynomials within the definition of can be chosen irreducible. Moreover it follows from the definition of the exponents that in the case of these irreducible polynomials have degree precisely . This fact was already an essential ingredient in the proof of , which is our Theorem  .   \] First assume . Then by clearly as well. Moreover, it is easy to check that the right bound in exceeds , see also Remark  . Hence we can restrict to . We will further assume for simplicity. The case can be treated very similarly by considering the polynomials for which tends to infinity.  By the choice of we have . Hence, as carried out above, for any there exist infinitely many irreducible integer polynomials of degree precisely such that Fix one such irreducible of large height and small to be chosen later and let We want to give a lower bound on for an arbitrary integer polynomial of degree at most and height . We distinguish two cases.  Case 1: The polynomial is not a polynomial multiple of . Then are coprime as is irreducible, and thus we may apply Lemma  . First assume . Then we infer The upper bound follows for such as we may choose and arbitrarily small, and doing so the right hand side in tends to , whereas the remaining expression in is non-negative. Now assume . Then yields  First assume . Then Lemma   yields This contradicts for sufficiently large and sufficiently small , by our hypothesis . Hence must hold. Then Lemma   implies where . Combination with yields hence This contradicts our assumption , which is equivalent to , when is chosen small enough compared to . This contraction finishes the proof of case 1.  Case 2: The integer polynomial is of the form for some integer polynomial . The degree of is at most since has degree at most and has degree precisely . Moreover from Wirsing’s estimate we infer Let be small. By definition of , for a variation of (that tends to as does) and for sufficiently large , all but finitely many satisfy We briefly discuss the possible exceptions for the given . By the finiteness and transcendence of we infer an absolute lower bound . Thus for we have . The bound follows similarly to as and . Now we treat the main case of that satisfy . Together with and Wirsing’s estimate we obtain We conclude As we may choose and arbitrarily small, we obtain for arbitrarily small . Inserting the value of from we obtain The right bound in follows with elementary rearrangements. Since this holds for any polynomial multiple of of height , the proof of case 2 is finished as well.
