    <title> Dirichlet’s and Thomson’s principles for non-selfadjoint elliptic
operators with application to non-reversible metastable diffusion
processes.</title>
    <abstract>We present two variational formulae for the capacity in the context of
non-selfadjoint elliptic operators. The minimizers of these variational
problems are expressed as solutions of boundary-value elliptic
equations. We use these principles to provide a sharp estimate for the
transition times between two different wells for non-reversible
diffusion processes. This estimate permits to describe the metastable
behavior of the system. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="This article is divided in two parts. In the first one, we present two variational formulae which extend the classical Dirichlet’s and Thomson’s principles to non-selfadjoint elliptic operators. In the second one, we use these formulae to describe the metastable behavior of a non-reversible diffusion process in a double-well potential field.  Fix a smooth, bounded, domain (open and connected) , , and a smooth function . Denote by the set of functions such that on , the boundary of . The classical Dirichlet’s principle states that the energy is minimized on by the harmonic function on which takes the value at the boundary, that is, by the solution of  When , where are smooth domains, and , on , , respectively, the minimal energy is called the capacity. In electrostatics, it corresponds to the total electric charge on the conductor held at unit potential and grounded at . It is denoted by and can be represented, by the divergence theorem, as where is the harmonic function which solves , is the outward normal vector to , and the surface measure at .  These results have long been established for self-adjoint operators of the form , provided , , are smooth, positive-definite, symmetric matrices, and is a smooth potential. They have been extended, more recently, by Pinsky to the case in which the operator is not self-adjoint. In this situation, the minimization formula for the capacity, mentioned above, has to be replaced by a minmax problem.  The first main result of this article provides two variational formulae for the capacity in terms of divergence-free flows. In contrast with the minmax formulae, the first optimization problem is expressed as an infimum, while the second one is expressed as a supremum, simplifying the task of obtaining lower and upper bounds for the capacity.  Analogous Dirichlet’s and Thomson’s principles were obtained by Gaudillière and Landim (the Dirichlet’s principle) and by Slowik (the Thomson principle) for continuous-time Markov chains.  In the second part of the article, we use the formulae for the capacity to examine the metastable behavior of a non-reversible diffusion in a double well potential.  Let be a smooth, double-well potential which diverges at infinity, and let be a non-symmetric, positive-definite matrix. We impose in Section   further assumptions on . Denote by the transpose of and by its symmetric part. Consider the diffusion , , described by the SDE where is a standard -dimensional Brownian motion, and is the symmetric, positive-definite square root of , i.e., .  Assume that has two local minima, denoted by , , separated by a single saddle point , and that . The stationary state of , given by , is concentrated in a neighborhood of when the previous inequality is strict.  If starts from a neighborhood of , it remains there for a long time in the small noise limit until it overcomes the potential barrier and jumps to a neighborhood of through the saddle point . Denote by the hitting time of a neighborhood of . The asymptotic behavior of the mean value of as has been the object of many studies.  The Arrhenius’ law asserts that the mean value is logarithmic equivalent to the potential barrier: , where represents the expectation of the diffusion starting from . The sub-exponential corrections, known as the Eyring-Kramers formula , have been computed when the matrix is symmetric and the potential non-degenerate at the critical points. Assuming that the Hessian of the potential is positive definite at and that it has a unique negative eigenvalue at , denoted by , while all the others are strictly positive, the sub-exponential prefactor is given by where as vanishes.  This estimate appears in articles published in the 60’s. A rigorous proof was first obtained by Bovier, Eckhoff, Gayrard, and Klein with arguments from potential theory, and right after by Helffer, Klein and Nier through Witten Laplacian analysis. We refer to Berglund and Bouchet and Reygner for an historical overview and further references.  Recentlty, Bouchet and Reygner extended the Eyring-Kramers formula to the non-reversible setting. They showed that in this context the negative eigenvalue has to be replaced by the unique negative eigenvalue of .  We present below a rigorous proof of this result, based on the variational formulae obtained for the capacity in the first part of the article, and on the approach developed by Bovier, Eckhoff, Gayrard, and Klein in the reversible case. This estimate permits to describe the metastable behavior of the diffusion in the small noise limit. Analogous results have been derived for random walks in a potential field in .">

As pointed out in for reversible diffusions and in for non-reversible Markov chains, the crucial point consists in defining these approximations in a mesoscopic neighborhood of the saddle point, denoted above by .

To introduce the vector fields , , and which approximate the vectors fields , , and , respectively, let and set  One could be tempted to set . One has to be cautious, however, because is discontinuous along , and these jumps become significant when applying the divergence theorem.  Let be the time scale given by In the presence of a unique saddle point separating two wells, Theorem   becomes    We have that  In view of the explicit expression for the minimizers of the variational problem in Proposition  , the function and the vector field are the natural candidates to estimate the capacity through . However, does not belong to the set , being discontinuous along the -dimensional surface . To overcome this difficulty, we convolve with a smooth mollifier , where is supported on the -dimensional unit ball.  Denote by the convolution of a function with the mollifier : . It follows from the explicit expression of and that and belongs to the set for sufficiently small .  We turn to the test vector field . Note that this flow is discontinuous along . As we need a smooth flow to apply the Dirichlet principle, one might be tempted to continuously extend this test field all the way to the valleys and along a suitable tube connecting these valleys and passing through the saddle point. This is indeed the scheme carried out for the test function in the reversible case considered in . The corresponding extension procedure for the test flow is not as simple, mainly because constructing a smooth divergence-free field which matches the boundary condition is very difficult.  We stress that in the discrete case , this difficulty is confronted directly and is solved by a delicate computation. We do not know yet how to carry out a similar procedure in the continuous context. Instead of applying Proposition  , we insert a discontinuous vector field in the proof of this proposition and we estimate the error terms coming from the lack of regularity of the vector field. In particular, the proof below shows that the regularity conditions imposed on the vector fields in the variational formulae for the capacity can be overpassed.  We start with the upper bound. Let and let Although does not satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition  , inserting in the proof of Proposition   provides an upper bound for the capacity.
