    <title>Duality between Lagrangian and Legendrian invariants</title>
    <abstract>Consider a pair , of a Weinstein manifold with an exact Lagrangian
submanifold , with ideal contact boundary , where is a contact manifold
and is a Legendrian submanifold. We introduce the Chekanov-Eliashberg
DG-algebra, , with coefficients in chains of the based loop space of and
study its relation to the Floer cohomology of . Using the augmentation
induced by , can be expressed as the Adams cobar construction applied to
a Legendrian coalgebra, . We define a twisting cochain: via holomorphic
curve counts, where denotes the bar construction and the graded linear
dual. We show under simply-connectedness assumptions that the
corresponding Koszul complex is acyclic which then implies that and are
Koszul dual. In particular, induces a quasi-isomorphism between and the
cobar of the Floer homology of , .

This generalizes the classical Koszul duality result between and for a
simply-connected manifold, where is the based loop space of , and
provides the natural geometric ingredient explaining the computations
given in in the case when is a plumbing of cotangent bundles of
2-spheres (where an additional weight grading ensured Koszulity of ).

We use the duality result to show that under certain connectivity and
locally finiteness assumptions, is quasi-isomorphic to for any
Lagrangian filling of .

Our constructions have interpretations in terms of wrapped Floer
cohomology after versions of Lagrangian handle attachments. In
particular, we outline a proof that is quasi-isomorphic to the wrapped
Floer cohomology of a fiber disk in the Weinstein domain obtained by
attaching to along (or, in the terminology of the wrapped Floer
cohomology of in with wrapping stopped by ). </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In this introduction we first give an overview of our results. The overview starts with a review of well known counterparts of our constructions in algebraic topology. We then introduce our Legendrian and Lagrangian invariants in Sections   and  , respectively, and discuss the connection between them and applications thereof in Section  . Finally, in Section   we give detailed calculations of the invariants introduced in the simple yet illustrative example of the Legendrian Hopf link filled by two Lagrangian disks intersecting transversely in one point.  The starting point for our study is a construction in classical topology. Consider the following augmented DG-algebras over a field associated to a based, connected, topological space : where is the singular cochain complex equipped with the cup-product and is the singular chain complex of the based loop space of equipped with the Pontryagin product. (We use cohomologically graded complexes throughout the paper so that all differentials increase the grading by 1.) In the case of singular cohomology, the inclusion gives the augmentation and in the case of the based loop space, the augmentation is given by the trivial local system .  If is of finite-type (for example, a finite CW-complex), then it is well known that one can recover the augmented DG-algebra from the augmented DG-algebra by the Eilenberg-Moore equivalence: In the other direction, if is SIMPLY CONNECTED, then the Adams construction gives a quasi-isomorphism and in this case and are said to be KOSZUL DUAL DG-algebras. Koszul duality is sometimes abbreviated and simply called DUALITY. For more general , using the method of acyclic models, Brown constructed a twisting cochain This is a degree 1 map that induces a DG-algebra map . By definition, the latter is a quasi-isomorphism when duality holds, and this can be detected by an associated KOSZUL COMPLEX, which is acyclic if and only if duality holds. In the general case, is a certain completion of and consequently is a more refined invariant of than .  In this paper, we pursue this idea in the context of invariants associated to Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds. Here the role played by simple connectivity in the above discussion have two natural counterparts, one corresponds to a generalized notion of simply-connectedness for intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds and the other is the usual notion of simply-connectedness for Legendrian submanifolds. We start with the geometric data of a Liouville domain with convex boundary and an exact Lagrangian submanifold with Legendrian boundary . We assume that , that the Maslov class of vanishes (for grading purposes) and that is relatively spin (to orient certain moduli spaces of holomorphic disks). Assume that is subdivided into embedded components intersecting transversely and that is subdivided into connected components . To avoid notational complications, we take both parametrized by the same finite set and assume that the boundary of is . We use a base field and define the semi-simple ring generated by mutually orthogonal idempotents . Also, we fix a partition into two disjoint sets, and choose a base-point for each .  For simplicity, let us restrict, in this introduction, to the following situation:   is a subcritical Liouville domain,  If then the corresponding Legendrian is an embedded SPHERE.  From a technical point of view, these restrictions are unnecessary. We make them in order to facilitate the explanation of the meaning of our constructions for Legendrian surgery. (Note that, the topology of is unrestricted when .)  We write for the completion of the Liouville “sector” obtained from by attaching critical Weinstein handles along for each and cotangent cones along for each . If , is an ordinary Liouville manifold. In general, it looks like a neighborhood of the zero section in the cotangent bundle , for some , outside a compact subset. Hence it is a geometrically bounded manifold, Gromov compactness holds , and holomorphic curve theory is well-behaved.  In , for , there is a closed exact Lagrangian submanifold , the union of the Lagrangian in and the LAGRANGIAN CORE DISK of the Weinstein handle attached to , and for , there is a non-compact Lagrangian obtained by attaching the cylindrical boundary to for , which we will still denote by , by abuse of notation, even when we view them now in . Dually, for each , we obtain (non-compact) exact Lagrangian disks , the LAGRANGIAN COCORE DISKS of the Weinstein handles attached to on , and for each , we construct DUAL Lagrangians disks intersecting once and asymptotic to a Legendrian meridian of (these can be constructed as the cotangent fiber at the point , , in , where is the base points on ).  The invariants that we will construct are associated to the union of Lagrangian submanifolds The Lagrangian will be referred to as a LAGRANGIAN SKELETON of , it is a union of Lagrangian submanifolds which intersect transversely. The dual Lagrangian is the union of Lagrangian disks which can be locally identified with cotangent fibers to irreducible components of .  We will study two algebraic invariants associated to . The first one is the LEGENDRIAN -ALGEBRA, . It corresponds to the endomorphism algebra of considered in the infinitesimal Fukaya category of . The second one is the CHEKANOV-ELIASHBERG DG-ALGEBRA, . It corresponds to the endomorphism algebra of considered in the partially wrapped Fukaya category of . However, we will take the pre-surgery perspective as in and construct all these invariants by studying Legendrian invariants of rather than Floer cohomology in . From this perspective, the case is a new construction, that generalizes the theory from in a way analogous to how partially wrapped Fukaya categories generalizes wrapped Fukaya categories .  The invariants and come equipped with canonical augmentations to the semi-simple ring and it is easy to see by construction that is determined by via the equivalence: The duality which would recover from holds in the “simply-connected” case (see Section  ). In the topological case discussed above, this is analogous to the simply-connectedness assumption on , which makes the augmented algebras and Koszul dual. In fact, the topological case is a special case of our study for the Weinstein manifold , with the Lagrangian skeleton given by the 0-section, and the dual Lagrangian given by a cotangent fiber .  We next sketch the definition of our version of the Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra (without any assumption of simply-connectedness). This is the DG-algebra over called above. Its underlying -bimodule is the unital -algebra freely generated by Reeb chords between components of and chains in for . (This is the crucial distinctions between and .)  We use the cubical chain complex (cf. ) for , see Section   for a discussion of other possible choices of chain models, to express as a free algebra over generated by Reeb chords and generators of for . Since is a free algebra over , the differential is determined by its action on generators. On a generator of we simply apply the usual differential. On a generator which is a Reeb chord, the differential is determined by moduli spaces of holomorphic disks in the symplectization which asymptotically converge to on the positive end and chords at the negative end as follows.  (2,3) to  (-0.5,0); (0,0) to  (0.5,0); (1,0) to  (1.5,0); (2,0) to  (2.5,0); (3,0) to  (3.5,0); (4,0) to  (4.5,0); (2.5,3) to  (5,0); (0,0) to (-0.5,0); (1,0) to (0.5,0); (2,0) to (1.5,0); (3,0) to (2.5,0); (4,0) to (3.5,0); (5,0) to (4.5,0); (2.5,3) to (2,3);  at (2.3, 3.3) ; at (-0.25,-0.3) ; at (0.75,-0.3) ; at (1.75,-0.3) ; at (2.75,-0.3) ; at (3.75,-0.3) ; at (4.75,-0.3) ;  at (1,2) ; at (0.25, 0.3) ; at (2.25, 0.3) ; at (3.25, 0.3) ;  Consider the moduli space of -holomorphic maps , where is a disk with boundary punctures that are mutually distinct and respects the counter-clockwise cyclic order of , and sends the boundary component of to , and is asymptotic to near the puncture at for and to near the puncture at . The moduli space, which is naturally a stratified space with manifold strata that carries a fundamental chain, comes with evaluation maps to for . The image of the fundamental chain determines a word in our chain model of . Reading these together with the Reeb chords in order gives the differential of .  We remark that loop space coefficients were used in the context of Lagrangian Floer cohomology before . See also , for uses of high-dimensional moduli spaces in Floer theory.  While with loop space coefficients is a powerful invariant, it is in general hard to compute as it involves high-dimensional moduli spaces of disks. As mentioned above, duality in the Legendrian will also play a role. More precisely, we define another DG-algebra related to via a Morse theoretic version of Adams cobar construction whose definition involves taking parallel copies of but uses only 0-dimensional moduli spaces (see Section  ). In fact, we prove that the two DG-algebras are quasi-isomorphic when for are simply-connected.  There exists a DG-algebra map which is a quasi-isomorphism when is simply-connected for all .">
  <outline text="Partially wrapped Fukaya categories by surgery" _note="Let be a Legendrian submanifold and as above. Furthermore, we use the notation above for co-core disks and write . An important result that is implicit in is the following:    Suppose , then there exists a surgery map defined via a holomorphic disk count that gives an quasi-isomorphism between the wrapped Floer cochain complex and the Legendrian DG-algebra .  A complete proof of this result has not yet appeared in the literature. See Appendix   for a discussion and a proof sketch. In Appendix  , one can also find a construction of wrapped Floer algebra which uses only purely holomorphic disks, and a proof that this agrees with the more standard version defined in which uses Hamiltonian perturbations.  One of the main guiding principles for the results in this paper is that Theorem   remains true when is non-empty, provided the Lagrangians are considered as objects of the PARTIALLY WRAPPED Fukaya category of , where the non-capped Legendrians for serve as STOPS (cf. ). The full proof of this result when is non-empty will appear elsewhere. We give an outline in Appendix  . Here we will use the geometric intuition provided by this viewpoint and our constructions of Legendrian invariants provide a rigorous “working definition” of even in the case that is non-empty, and also a starting point for the study of “partially wrapped Fukaya categories” via Legendrian surgery (extending the scope of considerably). For future reference, we state this result as a conjecture:    There exists a surgery map defined via moduli spaces of holomorphic disks which gives an quasi-isomorphism between the partially wrapped Floer cochain complex and the DG-algebra .  While writing this paper, we learned that Z. Sylvan independently considered a similar conjecture in relation with his theory of partially wrapped Fukaya categories .">

Such a filling gives an augmentation For chords on components , this is well known and given by a count of rigid disks with one positive puncture and boundary on . For chords on components , the same count composed with the augmentation on corresponding to the trivial local system gives the augmentation. This allows us to write for an coalgebra that we call the LEGENDRIAN -COALGEBRA (which depends on ). Here is the Adams cobar construction. Writing for the algebra which is the linear dual of , the following result recovers the Floer cochain complex of in .    There exists an quasi-isomorphism between the Floer cochain complex in the infinitesimal Fukaya category of , and the -module homomorphism of the -module , .  Note that, by the general properties of bar-cobar constructions (see Section  ), the algebra is quasi-isomorphic to the graded -dual of the bar construction on the algebra , which can be computed as  Let us remark that in the case is empty, the algebra is obtained from the construction in and , known as category, by adding a copy of making it unital.

  <outline text="Duality between partially wrapped and infinitesimal Fukaya categories" _note="We study duality in the setting of the two categories described above: the partially wrapped Fukaya category and the infinitesimal Fukaya category of (after surgery), or equivalently, the augmented DG-algebra and the augmented algebra (before surgery).  As we have seen in Theorem  , the augmented DG-algebra determines the augmented (unital) algebra . Now, a natural question is to what extent the quasi-isomorphism type of the algebra determines the quasi-isomorphism type of the augmented Legendrian DG-algebra .  We emphasize here the phrase “quasi-isomorphism type”: even though it is possible to construct chain models of the algebra (which is quasi-isomorphic to ) and the DG-algebra by counting “the same” holomorphic disks interpreted in different ways, the two algebras are considered with respect to different equivalence relations, and the resulting equivalence classes can be very different. In particular, it is NOT generally true that being a quasi-isomorphism of -coalgebras implies that is a quasi-isomorphism.  We will study this question by (geometrically) constructing a TWISTING COCHAIN (see Section  ): where stands for the bar construction and is the graded -dual. This twisting cochain induces a map of DG-algebras: which is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if is a KOSZUL twisting cochain. For example, we will prove the following result.  Suppose that is a locally finite, simply-connected -bimodule, then the natural map is a quasi-isomorphism.  This is an instance of KOSZUL DUALITY between the algebras and . This duality has many useful implications. For example, it implies an isomorphism between Hochschild cohomologies: When , an isomorphism defined via a surgery map was described between SYMPLECTIC COHOMOLOGY, , and the Hochschild cohomology . Therefore, when duality holds, we obtain a more economical way of computing .  In the case of cotangent bundles of simply-connected manifolds , this recovers a classical result due to Jones , which gives: where is simply-connected manifold of dimension and denotes the free loop space of .  In Section  , we give several concrete examples where the duality holds beyond the case of cotangent bundles. For example, the duality holds for plumbings of simply-connected cotangent bundles according to an arbitrary plumbing tree, see Theorem  .  In another direction, combining duality and Floer cohomology with local coefficients, we establish the following result for relatively spin exact Lagrangian fillings with vanishing Maslov class of a Legendrian submanifold .  Let and assume that and that is simply-connected. If is supported in degrees , then is simply connected. Moreover, if is a sphere then is isomorphic to , where , for a disk with boundary .  In general, duality between and does not hold (as can be seen for example by looking at cotangent bundles of non-simply connected manifolds or, letting be the standard Legendrian trefoil knot in filled by a punctured torus). However, there are cases when duality holds even if is not simply-connected, for instance because of the existence of an auxiliary weight grading, see or for an example in the 1-dimensional case see . It is a very interesting open question to find a geometric characterization of when duality holds.  As is well known, general constructions of Legendrian and Lagrangian holomorphic curve invariants require the use of so-called abstract perturbations. For our main invariant , all moduli spaces used can be shown to be transverse by classical techniques (see Theorem ( )) except for the rigid holomorphic planes in with a single positive end that are used to anchor the disks in the terminology of . (These are also relevant for defining the wrapped Floer cochain complex without Hamiltonian perturbations and for constructing the surgery map). In symplectic field theory similar transversality problems are dealt with by appealing to virtual perturbation techniques, see e.g. . Here we will not work out the details of this but merely assume such a perturbation scheme has been fixed. Our results are independent of the particular choice.  We also point out that our construction of applies without reference to virtual techniques in a number of interesting cases where splitting off of holomorphic planes can be ruled out for topological reasons. For example, if there are no contractible Reeb orbits, e.g. for .">

After change of variables, and , we obtain the free algebra with non-zero differential on generators: On the other hand, we can compute the Floer cochains of as The cohomology level computation follows easily from the geometric picture and general properties of Floer cohomology: is a union of a disk and a sphere that intersect transversely in one point and we have The only non-trivial product that does not involve idempotents is given by . For degree reasons, the only possible non-trivial higher products are: It turns out that one can take for all . Indeed, assuming that the structure is strictly unital (which can be arranged up to quasi-isomorphism), consider the relation that involves the term By induction on , this term has to vanish, which implies has to vanish for all . Let us confirm this by using the quasi-isomorphism: We introduce the counital -coalgebra with for which except for or 2 where there are the following non-zero terms: Write .

As an augmented algebra is: As before, we write a typical monomial as where for , denotes the corresponding element in with degree shifted up by 1. The differential on vanishes on , , and acts as follows on monomials: Here, by abuse of notation, we write for the induced coproduct .  The product is given by: The slightly unusual sign appears as a consequence of the following two facts:  The equation is equivalent to co- relations for .  The pair satisfies the relations .  Redefining to using removes the sign in , and becomes a (usual) associative DG-algebra, where Leibniz rule holds. The augmentation is given by letting to be the projection to and for .  There is a decreasing, exhaustive, bounded above filtration on the complex : given by This gives the WORD LENGTH SPECTRAL SEQUENCE with Unlike the case of the word length filtration on the bar construction, for the cobar construction, in general, convergence may fail. Thus, we introduce completions. We define the COMPLETED COBAR CONSTRUCTION to be: The length filtration on induces a filtration on defined by: which is decreasing, exhaustive, bounded above and complete Hausdorff. The spectral sequence associated to the filtration on is isomorphic to the length spectral sequence associated with the filtration on and converges conditionally to (see ). It converges strongly to if the spectral sequence is regular, i.e., only finitely many of the differentials are nonzero for each and (see ). This holds, for example, if is locally finite.  We say that is complete if the natural map is a quasi-isomorphism. For example, it is easy to see that this is the case if is locally finite and simply-connected.  If is an -comap which is a quasi-isomorphism of -coalgebras and if is complete then is a quasi-isomorphism. (This follows from , see also ). The condition that is complete is necessary and is related to the completeness of the word length filtration. A counter-example when the completeness assumption is dropped can be found in .  There is a universal twisting cochain given by the composition of canonical projection and the canonical inclusion .">

Similarly, if is a coaugmented conilpotent DG-coalgebra and is an augmented -algebra, then we have a canonical bijection given by (see Lemme 3.17 ).  Therefore, when is a coaugmented conilpotent DG-coalgebra, and is an augmented DG-algebra, we have the bar-cobar adjunction:  Notice, in particular, that the natural DG-maps are quasi-isomorphisms for any DG-algebra and conilpotent DG-coalgebra (see ). It is also true that for any -algebra , the algebra map given by the adjunction map is an -quasi-isomorphism (see ). Note that any -quasi-isomorphism is invertible up to homotopy ().  Similarly, for any -coalgebra , the -comap given by the adjunction map is an quasi-isomorphism.  However, an quasi-isomorphism for a general -coalgebra is not usually a convenient notion, since as we remarked above a quasi-isomorphism of coalgebras between and does not necessarily induce a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras and .  For this reason, one considers the category of CONILPOTENT coalgebras. Let be a coaugmented -coalgebra generated over by variables with some countable index set, such that there exists a total ordering where is a bijection. This produces an increasing filtration by setting . Suppose that the structure maps are compatible with this filtration, in the sense that, for all and . Then we call a conilpotent coalgebra.

Given two such coalgebras and , one considers filtered -comaps between them. In the case of a conilpotent DG-coalgebra there exists an increasing filtration on given by the subalgebras that plays the same role (see ).

In either case above we call a KOSZUL TWISTING COCHAIN if is a quasi-isomorphism, and we denote the set of Koszul twisting cochains by .  The terminology of Koszul twisting cochains is taken from . They are also called in other sources (cf. , ). This terminology is due to the well known fact that, under various locally finiteness assumptions, a twisting cochain is Koszul if and only if the Koszul complex ( ) associated is acyclic (cf. ).  Informally, if then, depending on whether we write or , either can be used in place of or can be used in place of in various resolutions. This, in turn, may lead to smaller complexes to compute with. For example, one can compute Hochschild homology and cohomology of and using the -bimodule resolution of given by the complex: with the differential as in , see .  Suppose that is an -algebra with an augmentation . The augmentation makes into a left -module or equivalently a right -module.  The KOSZUL DUAL of an augmented -algebra is the DG-algebra of left -module maps from to itself:  (Here, the -bimodule structure on is given by since is viewed as a left -module induced from its structure as a left -module. If instead, we have an augmentation of , then we view as a right -module, and the -bimodule structure on would be given by ).  Recall that for a unital -algebra over a field (or a semisimple ring such as ) any -module is both -projective and -injective, that is, if is an -module over and is an acyclic module over , then the complexes and are acyclic . Hence, the DG-algebra can be computed as the -module homomorphisms from to itself. (More generally, this holds if is -projective as a complex of - modules, which implies that is -projective as an -module over .) Therefore, we have the following.  If (resp. ) is an augmented unital -algebra then  Recall that is quasi-isomorphic to as an - module. Hence, by the hom-tensor adjunction, we have . Since is -projective as a complex of -modules, so is , hence the latter is computed by .  The cohomology is a graded algebra: Dually, we also have the derived tensor product , which can be computed by the complex . The cohomology is a graded coalgebra: In particular, note that if is a field, we have that by the universal coefficient theorem.  If is a [**commutative**]{} algebra (or more generally an -algebra), then also has a graded algebra structure defined via: induced by the algebra map (which exists since is commutative). This should not be confused with the natural coalgebra structure above.  Note that itself can be viewed as a left -module and the map is a map of left -modules, hence it induces a map of DG- algebras: which can in turn be viewed as an augmentation of since can again be identified with as it is the Yoneda image of as an -module. Hence, can be viewed as a right -module.  The double-dual of is defined to be .  There is a natural map from to its double-dual: defined via viewing the right -module as and acting on the left by .  We say that and are Koszul dual if is a quasi-isomorphism.  One standard situation when Koszul duality holds is the following:    Suppose is a locally finite, simply-connected -bimodule equipped with an -coalgebra structure and the coaugmentation . Let , which is an augmented connected DG-algebra. Then and and are Koszul dual. In other words, the natural morphism is a quasi-isomorphism.  First, observe that indeed by . Next, we have that where we applied Lemma   to and used the fact that since is locally finite.  In the case that is a locally finite, connected (but not simply-connected) -bimodule, Lemma   no longer applies. We instead use Lemma to deduce the following weaker duality result.    Let be a connected, locally finite -bimodule, equipped with an coalgebra structure and coaugmentation , and , which is an augmented DG-algebra where augmentation is given by projection to . Then and there is a quasi-isomorphism  Note that in Proposition  , is not connected, and may admit other augmentations than that induced by the cobar construction. Such augmentations will be considered below. For example, suppose that is a coaugmented coalgebra such that is generated by elements from an indexing set and that is an augmentation, which is induced by a map since is free. Now we can consider the coaugmented coalgebra such that Then and are quasi-isomorphic as non-augmented DG-algebras, and the augmentation on induced by the cobar construction coincides with the given augmentation on .    When is not simply-connected, the proof of duality fails precisely because is not locally finite. Nevertheless, the duality result can still be proved in certain cases where an extra WEIGHT grading (internal degree, or Adams degree) is available (see , , ). We will not study this situation systematically in this paper, but it is important as it extends the range of applicability of Koszul duality theory.

In Section   we define the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra with loop space coefficients using moduli spaces of disks of all dimensions, and in Section   we give a more computable version which uses only rigid disks and which carries the same information if the Legendrian submanifold is simply connected.">
  <outline text="Coefficients" _note="Before defining our Legendrian invariants, we describe chain models for their coefficients for . (Notation is as above, is a decorated connected component of the Legendrian .) We work over a field .  Let denote the topological monoid of Moore loops based at , where the monoid structure comes from concatenation of loops (see ). Write for the cubical chain complex (graded cohomologically). Since is a topological monoid, the complex becomes a DG-algebra using the natural product map on cubical chains, where the DG-algebra product is given as follows: We point out that the -map when both sides are equipped with the Pontryagin product, is a DG-algebra map.  In what follows, we shall also make use of an inverse to the , known as the Serre diagonal and the cubical analogue of the Alexander-Whitney map, To define this map consider the -cube with coordinates . For an ordered -element subset , , and for let be the map given in coordinates by Consider a cubical chain . If is an ordered subset of let denote its complement ordered in the natural way. Define by where the sum ranges over all ordered subsets and is the sign of the permutation . This is a strictly associative chain map inducing a quasi-isomorphism. Note also that there are obvious extensions of to several products of loop spaces.  As the cubical chain complex is very large it is not the most effective complex for computation. We next discuss smaller models. Starting with a 0-reduced simplicial set with geometric realization , an explicit economical model for is obtained by taking normalized chains on the Kan loop group . We will not say much about this, but point out that is a free simplicial group such that its geometric realization is homotopy equivalent to (cf. ). Hence, by the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence (cf. ) the normalized chains on gives a (weakly) equivalent model of . (Another similar construction is sketched in and leads to a free model.)  Alternatively, one can work with CW complexes. We start with the simply connected case: for a -reduced (unique 0-cell and no 1-cells) CW-structure on the Adams-Hilton construction gives a free DG-algebra model for as follows. Denote the -cells of by , and . The Adams-Hilton construction gives a CW monoid with a single 0-cell and generating cells in dimension that is quasi-isomorphic to as a monoid (cf. ). This gives a DG-algebra structure on the free algebra: and a DG-algebra map which is a quasi-isomorphism. The differential on is generally not explicit. It is defined recursively as follows. For every 2-cell , we have . In general, assume that and have been defined on the -skeleton of , then for each -cell , with attaching map , define so that where a generator of , and to be the -chain of loops in (which then depends on earlier choices along the boundary of ). We remark that can be identified isomorphically with for a suitable coalgebra structure on the cellular chain complex .  This construction can be generalized to the non-simply-connected case as follows. (See , a generalization was given earlier in , however that paper contains an error.) Begin with a -reduced CW-structure on . Denote the -cells by for . For each -cell with , we have a free variable in degree which we again denote by . For each -cell , we have two variables and in degree 0 such that . Thus, the underlying algebra is the “almost free” algebra of the form  This presentation is often more efficient than the presentation one gets from the Kan loop group construction using a simplicial set presentation of . However, the differential in the Adams-Hilton model is not easy to describe explicitly. Note that we have for degree reasons. For every 2-cell , we have where represents the class of the attaching map of . The differential on higher dimensional cells is generally harder to compute and is exactly as in the simply-connected case discussed above.  Augmentations correspond to solutions of the equations Since is a presentation of the fundamental group algebra , augmentations correspond exactly to local systems .  We will use the cubical chain complex to define Legendrian invariants below. Cubical chains work uniformly for all spaces and are convenient for showing that the fundamental classes of moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic disks , via evaluation maps, take values in the chain complex. The Legendrian invariants can also be studied using any of the smaller models discussed above. It is however important to note that in the non-simply connected case, we only have either weak equivalence in the homotopy category of DG-algebras or Morita equivalence of these models and the cubical chain complex .  In the case that is simply-connected we can use a DG-algebra map that goes in the opposite direction to the Adams-Hilton map to pass to a more economical quasi-isomorphic model. Such a homotopy equivalence is constructed in two steps: first, in using Eilenberg-Moore methods, a DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism: is constructed where in both instances refers to the normalised singular chains. Second, using the standard -coalgebra quasi-isomorphism between the DG-coalgebra of singular chains and the coalgebra of normalised cellular chains, one obtains a DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism since we assumed that the complexes and are simply-connected. (In Section  , we also give a more geometric construction of a DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism using Morse flow trees.)  Similarly, if is homotopy equivalent to an Eilenberg-Maclane space , then the singular chains can be replaced with the group algebra : there exists a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras given by sending a -chain to its homology class, and sending all higher dimensional chains to 0. Note that this DG-algebra map exists for any space , but is a quasi-isomorphism only in the case that is homotopy equivalent to .  It is often convenient to use a cofibrant (or free) replacement for . For example, if , then and a cofibrant replacement is given by the free graded algebra with the differential A DG-algebra defined over can be pulled back to a weakly equivalent DGA over this cofibrant replacement. (See for background in model categories on DG-algebras that we are using in a very simple case here.)">

  <outline text="Construction of Legendrian invariants" _note="As above, let be a Liouville domain with (for -grading) and its contact boundary. Let be a Legendrian submanifold in where is a connected component of . Assume that is relatively spin and that its Maslov class vanishes. Let each connected component be decorated with a sign and write and for the union of the components decorated accordingly. (Our different treatments of and is natural from the point of view of handle attachments; recall from the introduction that when is a union of spheres we attach usual Lagrangian disk-handles to and handles with cotangent ends to .) When we have an exact Lagrangian filling of (relatively spin and with vanishing Maslov class), can also be decomposed into embedded components . These embedded components are not disjoint, they are allowed to intersect transversely at finitely many points. There is a bijection between and the embedded components of .  We require that if two components and are boundary components of the same embedded component then either both belong to or both to . Using this property, we get a decomposition , corresponding to the decomposition .  Let be the semi-simple ring generated by mutually orthogonal idempotents . If we are not given a filling of , then the index set is taken to be the connected components of instead. If we need to distinguish between the two choices, we will denote them as and . Note that there is an injective ring map which takes the idempotent corresponding to an embedded component to the sum of idempotents of its boundary components . In particular, this map turns any -bimodule into a -bimodule.  Let denote the set of non-empty Reeb chords of . This is a graded set: the grading of a chord is given by where is the Conley-Zehnder grading, see Section  . (With this convention, the unique chord of the standard Legendrian unknot in has and for the corresponding Legendrian unknot in with one Reeb chord , . See also Rmk.  .)  Note that is a -bimodule, where corresponds to the set of Reeb chords from to . The underlying algebra of the standard Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra is generated freely by over . We need to modify this in the case is non-empty to incorporate chains in the based loop space of for . Let us first do this using cubical chains.  For each , consider the cubical chains as a -algebra by requiring that the left or right action of is trivial except if when it acts as identity. Let be the algebra over given by freely adjoining elements of to the union of for . Thus an element of is a word in Reeb chords and chains on based loops of for that respects the -bimodule structure.  Now the differential on is defined by extending the differential on the cubical complexes for . Since the elements of are added freely, it suffices to describe the differential on a single Reeb chord and extend it by the graded Leibniz rule. The differential on a Reeb chord decomposes to a sum where for any Reeb chord only finitely many are non-zero. The operations are defined as follows.  Consider moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with positive puncture at , see Section   for definitions and notation. More precisely, consider Reeb chords such that is a composable word and let . Consider the disk with one distinguished positive puncture and negative punctures (across which the boundary numbering is constant in the terminology of Section  ). Consider the moduli space . Theorems   and   imply that this is a smooth orientable manifold with a natural compactification as a stratified space that carries a fundamental chain. It follows that, via the evaluation map at a point in the boundary arcs of , parameterizes a chain of paths in the -fold product , which after adding reference paths to the base point becomes chain of based loops in . We treat two cases separately. First, if all boundary components of map to components in then we let where is the algebraic number of -components in the moduli space. Second, if some boundary component maps to a component in then we write for the chain or paths in , where we separate the components in the product by the Reeb chords : where are the components of the fundamental chain . Further, we write for each boundary component that maps to a component in in between the Reeb chords as above.  A subtle point here is that the moduli space naturally gives rise to a chain in the rather than . Note that are simply components of , they are not considered as chains. To separate these out we apply the cubical Alexander-Whitney map, recalled in Section  :  With these conventions we then define for , where we separate the components of the tensor product by the Reeb chords in in analogy with the notation for the product chain and where is the Serre diagonal. The output of is thus a sum of alternating words of chains of loops in and Reeb chords, and is an operation of degree on . We point out that if there are components then higher dimensional moduli spaces contribute to the differential (unlike the case when ). Note also that it is possible to have holomorphic disks contributing to , which means that the chord is the positive puncture of a disk without negative punctures.  Let be the map extended to by the graded Leibniz rule. Then is a differential, . We call with the differential the [**Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra**]{}.  When , was called in - this is cohomologically graded version of the usual Legendrian homology algebra in . By definition, we have .  In case there are only components in involved the result follows from standard arguments involving the boundary of 1-dimensional moduli spaces. Consider therefore the case when there are chains in the loop space involved.  Let . The -dimensional moduli space contributes to . Its boundary consists of broken curves with one level of dimension and one of dimension for , we find, with denoting the natural tensor extension of the boundary operator in singular homology over boundary components involved in , that where denotes the Pontryagin product, where , and . We next apply the cubical Alexander-Whitney map to this formula to deduce where we used that the is a chain map and is compatible with the product. The fact that is a chain map is well known. We verify that it is compatible with the product below. It follows that the terms contributing to which arises from the differential acting on chains and acting on Reeb chords cancel.  It remains to check that is compatible with the products, to this end we provide the simplest non-trivial case, the general case is done similarly. Thus, we need to check that the following compositions agree: and This is easily checked by evaluating it on a test chain . Note that this uses the fact that the cubical chain complex is a quotient. Namely, degenerate cubical chains are divided out.    As mentioned in the introduction we relate as defined above to a parallel copies version of the same algebra which is defined solely in terms of rigid moduli spaces. In order to do so it is convenient to use a topologically simpler but algebraically more complicated model of , defined as follows. The generating set of our algebra is extended to chains in the product , where we separate the coordinate functions by Reeb chords. We define the product of two such chains by taking the Pontryagin product of the chains at adjacent factors giving an operation The differential on this version of is then defined by the singular differential one the chain and as on Reeb chord generators. (In other words we define it as above but disregard the diagonal approximation.) It follows from the Künneth formula that the two versions of are quasi-isomorphic.  Although, the definitions of given above works generally, from a computational perspective, it is hard to get our hands on, as the cubical chain complexes have uncountably many elements.  Next, we provide a modification of the definition that gives a quasi-isomorphic DG-algebra, under the assumption that for each , there exists a DG-algebra quasi-isomorphism where is a DG-algebra structure on a free algebra generated by a graded finite set . For example, as discussed in Section  , such a DG-algebra map exists when is simply-connected (or if is a space, one can first work with the group ring and base-change to a cofibrant replacement of it).  We define a graded quiver with vertex set and arrows in correspondence with More precisely, there are arrows from vertex to corresponding to the set of Reeb chords from to . In addition, for each , there are arrows from to corresponding to the elements in . Let be the graded -bimodule generated by . Thus, there is one generator for each arrow in and an idempotent for each vertex and write for the submodule without the idempotents.  Let be -algebra given by the tensor algebra Recall that the path algebra of a quiver is defined as a vector space having all paths in the quiver as basis (including, for each vertex an idempotent ), and multiplication given by concatenation of paths. Thus, the -bimodule is the path algebra of the quiver where the grading of each arrow is shifted up by . Just like in the cobar construction we write elements in as where .  Next, we equip the -algebra with a differential using the moduli spaces of holomorphic disks defined in Section  . This differential is induced by operations where , that give the structure of an coalgebra if .  Consider a generator of . If it is a generator of the free model of for some component then we define where is the co-product that corresponds to homogeneous piece of the differential in the free model of . If it is a Reeb chord the define as before using moduli spaces but now take the image of all the singular chains in under the map . Since the map is a DG-algebra map, the proof that is differential on is the same. Furthermore, since is a quasi-isomorphism, we get a quasi-isomorphic chain complex if we use coefficients instead of .  From now on, unless otherwise specified, we will always assume that we work with a free (over ) model of .  If there exists an augmentation , then there is a change of coordinates which turn into a coalgebra. More precisely, consider the restriction of , , where we think of as the degree polynomials in . Define Note that is generated idempotents and by , where ranges over the generators of . Let be the -algebra automorphism defined on generators as . Define the operations by    The operations satisfy the -coalgebra relations and with these operations is a coaugmented conilpotent coalgebra.  Let denote the differential on and let be a generator of . Since is a augmentation, and it follows that . The coalgebra relations then follows by combining the equation from Theorem   with the automorphism .  The coaugmentation is simply the inclusion of . The fact that is conilpotent follows from Stokes’ theorem: the sum of the actions of the Reeb chords at the negative end of a disk contributing to the differential is bounded above by the action of the Reeb chord at the positive end. This gives the desired finiteness.  Note that if the original operation on equals then the map which takes all generators of to is an augmentation and in this case by construction.  If there is an augmentation then can be expressed as the cobar construction of a coalgebra: by construction  We next consider the -linear dual of . It follows from Section   that this is an augmented -algebra. We call it the LEGENDRIAN -ALGEBRA.  In case , it can be shown that this algebra can be obtained from the endomorphism algebra of the augmentation in category of by adjoining a unit to it, but is, in general, different from the endomorphism algebra in the category of .  Given an augmentation , we define the [**completed Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra**]{} to be . The underlying -algebra is the completed tensor algebra: where is the ideal determined by the natural augmentation.  Note that there is a natural chain map:    To illustrate the various gradings, the unique Reeb chord for the standard Legendrian unknot in has degree is in , in and in (while it is in ).

  <outline text="Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra with parallel copies" _note="We will relate the Legendrian invariants and to Floer (co)homology of exact Lagrangian submanifolds. When studying Lagrangian Floer (co)homology we employ the technique of parallel copies to achieve transversality and it will be convenient to express the Legendrian invariants in the same language. As it turns out, in the case that the Legendrians are simply connected this technique leads to a simpler formulation of the theory which incorporates a model of chains on the based loop space automatically. Recall that Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian submanifolds induce augmentations, which after change of variables lead to non-curved Legendrian co-algebras. Geometrically, this means that one uses anchored holomorphic disks. We will assume that an augmentation of has been fixed in this section and all disks considered will be anchored with respect to this augmentation. We now turn to the description of this theory in the Legendrian setting.  Let be as above with decomposition . Fix a Morse function which is positive on and negative on . Use it as described in Section   to construct a system of parallel copies of .  Let , , and be as above. Let denote the Reeb chords connecting to that lie in a small neighborhood of . By construction there is then a natural 1-1 correspondence between and the set of critical points of on . (Since shifts in the negative Reeb direction there are no such short chords near .) Write and think of chords in as connecting a component to itself. Again the set is a graded set: Reeb chords are graded as above and the grading of a short chord equals the negative of the Morse index of the critical point of corresponding to .  We define a graded quiver with vertex set and arrows in correspondence with More precisely, there are arrows from vertex to corresponding to the set of Reeb chords from to if and corresponding to short Reeb chords from to if .  Let be the graded -bimodule generated by . We define an coalgebra structure on given by operations as follows. Given a chord (input) and a chords (outputs), we consider the disk with distinguished puncture at and an STRICTLY INCREASING boundary decoration . Let . Consider the moduli space . We write for the algebraic number of -components in this moduli space provided and otherwise. Define for , where . This gives an operation of degree on . Note that trivially, since the decoration is strictly increasing.  It is not a priori clear that the maps are well-defined as the sum may involve infinitely many terms. This can be avoided easily if are simply-connected for . Namely, the simply-connectedness of guarantees that the short chords cost index, whereas the long chords cost energy. In the non-simply connected case, we will only consider a completed version of where infinite expressions are allowed.  Suppose is simply-connected or more generally, suppose that factorizes through the natural inclusion for all , then equipped with the operations is an coalgebra.  Recall that the moduli spaces involved in the definition of the operations are moduli spaces of anchored disks, where we use the augmentation induced by the filling . Consider a 1-dimensional moduli space and note that its boundary consists of two level rigid disks by Theorems   and  . There are two cases, either the levels are joined at a chord connecting the same copy of to itself or the chord connects distinct copies. Since we count anchored disks and since the augmentation satisfies the chain map equation, the first type of breaking cancels algebraically. Theorem   then shows that there are canonical identifications between moduli spaces for different increasing numberings and the proof follows since the second type of breakings are exactly what contributes to the coalgebra relations and are then in algebraic one to one correspondence with the endpoints of an oriented compact 1-manifold.  We next introduce the parallel copies version of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra. Consider a generator of which is a small Reeb chord that corresponds to a critical point of the Morse function . The coalgebra operations then counts holomorphic disks with positive puncture at which, by an action argument, must lie in a small neighborhood of . In particular, rigid such holomorphic disks are in natural correspondence with rigid Morse flow trees. It follows from this that if is the minimum of the Morse function on the component then , , and for . Furthermore, if is any other generator corresponding to an arrow from to then and does not contain any factor for . The equations involving only follows by the description of flow trees emanating from a minimum, the other equations follows from the fact that any rigid disk with an output puncture at the minimum must correspond to a flow line attached to a trivial strip, for dimensional reasons. It then follows that there is a coaugmentation  If is simply-connected, the parallel copies Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra is If is not simply-connected, then we define the completed DG-algebra with the differential induced from the operations .  As in the case with loop space coefficients we also define the Legendrian -algebra of as the linear dual of the Legendrian co-algebra: Note that since there is no finiteness condition necessary for , this is well-defined for all without any need to complete.">

  <outline text="Isomorphism between Chekanov-Eliashberg algebras in the simply connected case" _note="We next show that if is simply connected then is in fact isomorphic to . To this end we first establish a Morse theoretic version of Adams result mentioned in the introduction, which here corresponds to the purely local situation of the zero-section in a 1-jet space.  Let be a SIMPLY-CONNECTED smooth manifold with a base point . Fix a system of positive Morse functions , and assume that the functions have only one minimum and no index one critical points. (This can always be arranged by handle cancellation if , see Remarks   and   for the lower dimensional case.) We will first discuss a Morse flow tree model for chains on that we denote . Our treatment of Morse flow trees follows .  Consider a strip or half-strip with coordinates and with slits along , , and in the half-strip case. In the half strip case the vertical segment is a finite end that will be an used as an input, and we do not consider it as a part of the boundary of the strip with slits. In the strip case, the input is at the puncture , and in both cases we call punctures at output. Order the boundary components according to the positive boundary orientation of the disk with punctures starting from the input and decorate its boundary components by a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers . Let denote this decoration. Cutting the strip by line segments , , subdivides it into STRIP REGIONS of the form , where , , and and with a numbering on each boundary component and .  A flow tree is a continuous map from a strip with slits into which in each strip region depends only on the first coordinate and there satisfies the gradient equation where is the numbering of the upper horizontal boundary of the strip region and that of the lower.  A partial flow tree is defined analogously except that the domain is a half-strip with slits .  If is a critical point of then we let denote the negative Morse index of . If is a word of critical points of then the space of flow trees with input puncture at and output punctures , in the order induced by the boundary orientation, has dimension For sufficiently small perturbing system of Morse functions , the space of flow trees is independent of the increasing boundary decoration . Let denote the -module generated by critical points of and equip with the structure of a coalgebra with operations given by where the sum ranges over all of word length . It is not hard to see that the boundary of a 1-dimensional space of flow trees consists of broken rigid flow trees from which it follows that the operations satisfy the coalgebra relations. Furthermore, the coalgebra has a natural co-unit, the critical point which is the minimum of . We will call this critical point the CO-UNIT CRITICAL POINT. We say that a flow tree with no puncture mapping to the co-unit critical point is CO-UNIT FREE.  The coalgebra is in fact known to agree with the Floer coalgebra , where we view as the zero section in its own cotangent bundle as follows. Let be the system of parallel copies of the -section corresponding to the system of functions . Then by a special case of (the case when fronts have no singularities at all), there is, for all sufficiently small shifts, a natural one to one correspondence between rigid holomorphic disks with boundary on and Morse flow trees in determined by . This gives a chain isomorphism .  We now return to the Morse theoretic approach to Adams’ result. We will define a map in terms of the operation of attaching co-unit free partial flow trees to Moore loops , , based at , parameterized by a simplex, . To define this operation we will use the following notion: we say that a partial flow tree parameterized by a half-strip starts at a point if its input puncture maps to , .  (-5,-1) to (0,-1); (-5,2) to (0,2); (0,0) to (-1,0); (0,1) to (-2,1);  (-5,3) to (0,3); (-5,5) to (0,5); (0,4) to (-1.5,4);  (-5,6) to (0,6); (-5,8) to (0,8); (0,7) to (-2,7);  (-5,2) to (-5,3); (-5,5) to (-5,6);  (-5, -1) to  (-5,8); at (-5.5,0.5) ; at (-5.5,4) ; at (-5.5,7) ;  at (0.4,-1) []{}; at (0.4,2) []{}; at (0.4,0) []{}; at (0.4,1) []{};  at (0.4,3) []{}; at (0.4,5) []{}; at (0.4,4) []{}; at (0.4,6) []{}; at (0.4,8) []{}; at (0.4,7) []{};  Attaching partial flow trees to then means fixing points and partial flow trees , that start at . Our map takes values in and will accordingly be defined by attaching flow trees which have no output at the co-unit. Note that the set of positive punctures of minimum free partial flow trees for a fixed decreasing boundary numbering constitutes a codimension two subset in and that the corresponding subset for any numbering lies in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of it. Choosing the Morse data generically means in particular that the base point does not lie on any minimum free partial flow tree.  If is a loop with flow trees attached at , we also introduce a numbering of the components of induced by the flow trees attached as follows. The right most interval is numbered by . The right boundary segment of the strip with slits attached at is numbered by as well, whereas the left boundary segment of its domain is numbered by . We number the boundary segment and the right boundary segment of the domain of the flow tree attached at by as well. The left boundary segment of the flow tree attached at is then numbered by , which determines the numbering of the segment as well as the right boundary segment in the flow tree at , etc. We view the end result of this process as the domain for a loop with flow trees attached with numbering that decreases, see Figure  .  Note next that if is a -dimensional cube in general position with respect to , the set of , for which a single partial flow tree can be attached is at most -dimensional. Attaching more partial flow trees, the dimension decreases further, by at least one for each flow tree. We say that the loops in with flow trees attached which form -dimensional family are the rigid loops with flow trees in . If is a cubical simplex in and if is a word of critical points then we let denote the space of loops with flow trees in , where the critical points at punctures of the flow trees read in order give the word . The dimension of is then where is the word length.  Note that if the set of loops in with flow trees is transversely cut out then by definition of the system of perturbing Morse functions, the loops with flow trees corresponding to a different decreasing numbering is canonically diffeomorphic to that corresponding . We define the map by counting rigid loops with flow trees in cubical simplices :  The map is defined only for chains that are suitably transverse to the Morse flow trees defined by the system of shifting functions . Since the Morse functions do not have any index one critical points a partial flow tree has at most punctures. There is a natural evaluation map on partial flow trees that takes a flow tree to the location of its positive puncture. The image of this map for partial flow trees not involving the minimum is a stratified space of codimension one and by definition of the perturbation scheme the corresponding set for partial flow trees defined by distinct boundary numberings lie arbitrarily close to each other. The map above is defined for chains of loops with evaluation maps that are smooth and transverse to this stratified subset. It is straightforward to see that any chain of loops is homotopic to such a transverse chain and that any two transverse chains that are homologous are homologous through a transverse chain of loops. This means that we can replace all chains by chains that represent these transversality conditions.  In order to connect this to the path loop fibration we consider a similar map where denotes the canonical twisting cochain of the cobar construction and the based path space. The map again counts rigid paths with flow trees, where a path with flow trees is defined as a loop with flow trees except that we also attach a flow tree at the endpoint of the path. Furthermore, the last puncture in the flow tree attached at the endpoint is the distinguished last factor and is allowed to be the co-unit critical point. (Other punctures are still not the co-unit critical point, which means that flow trees before the last are still co-unit free and that in the last flow tree only the last puncture is allowed to be the co-unit). We point out that the differential on the twisted complex acting on the last factor in the right hand side counts trees where the last puncture is distinguished.  The maps and are chain maps.  To see this note that the contributions to the chain map equation in both cases correspond to the boundary of an oriented compact 1-dimensional manifold.  The codimension one boundary of corresponds either to the loop or path moving to the boundary of or to the breaking of a flow tree at a critical point. Instances when two trees are attached at the same point are naturally interior points of the moduli space where the disks with slits joins to a new disk with a slit of width equal to the sum of the widths.

The first observation is that the chain complex is acyclic. To see that, note that for each critical point there is a unique flow tree with positive puncture and two negative punctures, one at the co-unit and one at . Filtering by degree we find that this is the only part of the differential which contributes to the differential on the first page of the corresponding spectral sequence. Since it gives an isomorphism from words not ending with the co-unit to those which does end with , the desired acyclicity follows. Clearly, is also acyclic.  Note next that the map respects the filtration by degree at the end point. The corresponding -terms with induced maps are and -terms Zeeman’s comparison theorem then establishes the result.    If then the Morse function may have critical points of index one. In this case we use stabilization as follows. Multiply by for any , and consider the function , then has the same critical points as and is inward point at infinity. In there is room to cancel 1-handles and the above applies. In this case we define to be (which is a 1-reduced version of the original complex). Noting that and are canonically isomorphic the result follows also in this case.  We next show that and are isomorphic if is simply connected. This is a more or less direct consequence of the description of rigid disks on a Legendrian with parallel copies and the isomorphism in Theorem  . Since components in are not affected by this choice of versus , we disregard them and assume that in what follows.  Recall the definition of given in Remark  , generated by chains in the product of the based loop space of with factors separated by Reeb chords. Here the differential of a chain in the product of the based loop space of with factors separated by Reeb chords. Here the differential of a chain is just the usual differential of the chain whereas the differential of a Reeb chord is a sum over all moduli spaces of disks with one positive puncture at the chord and any number of negative punctures. Such a moduli space carries a fundamental chain and the contribution to the differential is alternating word of chains in the based loop space corresponding to the boundary arcs of the disk carried by the fundamental chain and Reeb chords at the negative puncture: where and is a word of Reeb chords.  We next consider a system of parallel copies defined by a system of positive Morse functions , where . Recall that the generators of the algebra are the Reeb chords connecting to , and that these are long, corresponding to Reeb chords of and short, corresponding to critical points of , except for the minimum. The differential counts rigid disks with one positive puncture in where is a decreasing boundary numbering, .  If is a word of Reeb chords let denote the word obtained by removing all short Reeb chords and that obtained by removing all long Reeb chords. Let denote the system of parallel copies defined by the system .    For all sufficiently small there is a natural one to one correspondence between rigid holomorphic disks with one positive puncture in and rigid configurations of a holomorphic disk with boundary on in with partial flow trees attached along the boundary, where the partial flow trees have negative punctures corresponding to and such that the total word of negative asymptotics is .  This was proved in the setting of knot contact homology in and in the case when there is only one flow line attached in . The proof has three parts, convergence, gluing, and surjectivity of gluing. All relevant technicalities in this more general case can be handled as there.  We next consider the map which takes every Reeb chord to itself and takes a chain in the based loop space to , where is as in and where we identify the critical points of with the corresponding Reeb chords connecting to .    The map is a DG-algebra map and if is simply connected then is a quasi-isomorphism.  The fact that is a chain map follows from Theorem  . Filter the algebras by action of Reeb chords in the left hand side and actions of long Reeb chords in the right hand side. The map respects this filtration and gives an isomorphism on the -pages by Theorem  . Since the sum actions of the Reeb chords at the negative end is bounded by that at the positive the spectral sequences converges. The theorem follows.    Note that the isomorphism in Theorem   is compatible with the stabilization of Remark  . To see this we multiply the ambient contact manifold with contact form by and consider with contact form . The Reeb chord of then come in -families, one for each Reeb chord of . Consider the contact form and note that with respect to this contact form the Reeb chords of are in natural one to one correspondence with those of and there is a canonical isomorphism between and . In fact the disks in the differential are canonically identified. It follows in particular, that Theorem   holds also if .">

We will associate several chain level structures to . To begin with, let us first assume that is an embedded Lagrangian. Since has boundary, in classical topology, one can consider either or . In our case, these two choices are reflected in the choices of or decorations on , respectively. More generally, let , be the (irreducible) components of . As with the Legendrian submanifolds in Section  , we assume these components of are decorated by signs and we write for the corresponding decomposition. Let be a Morse function with prescribed behaviour at infinity (depending on the or decoration) as explained in Section  . We use this to construct a system of parallel copies , as in Section  , shifted at infinity along the Reeb flow either in the positive or negative direction on and , respectively.  Now, using the parallel copies, , we define a graded quiver as follows. The parallel copies give rise to following sets, fix positive integers, and with :  Intersection points in bijection with the union of critical points of . (These critical points may depend on the or decoration on , for example, one can turn a decorated component into decorated, by introducing critical points corresponding to the topology of , see Figure  ).

So, fix a pair such that and define a graded quiver with vertex set and with an arrow connecting to (possibly equal to ) for each element of the above sets. Let denote the set of arrows.  Alternatively, one can describe the generators as the set of intersection points in , between the original and the first shifted copy.  Let be the graded -bimodule generated by .

Consider the disk with boundary punctures and with a decreasing numbering of its boundary arcs . Let . Consider the moduli space . Define the operations by where denotes the word length of and where denotes the algebraic number of points in the oriented 0-dimensional manifold.  The operations satisfy the -algebra relations.  This follows by the usual argument: after noting that the decreasing boundary numbering ensures that there is no boundary bubbling, one observes that the terms in the -algebra relations count the ends of a 1-dimensional oriented compact manifold by Theorems   and  . Note also that the operations compose because of Theorem  .  We call the Lagrangian Floer cohomology algebra of . Note that there is an idempotent on each component corresponding to the minimum of the shifting Morse function, which is increasing at infinity since we shift in the positive Reeb direction. We write for the sum of over all components in . We write for the augmented algebra where we adjoined an idempotent for each component . (On these components the shifting function is decreasing at infinity and has a maximum rather than a minimum in the compact part.) Note that this is a connected algebra over .  The two different choices of perturbations at infinity corresponding to and are the two extremal constructions where one pushes the copies either always in positive direction or always in the negative direction. One can also choose perturbations at infinity to depend on the topology of the manifold at infinity (see, for example, Section 4 of ). All our constructions should extend meaningfully to this more general setting but we have not pursued this direction in this paper.  We next consider various linear duals of and associated algebraic objects. The simplest case occurs when is simply connected. In this case the linear dual is a coalgebra with operations dual to , and as before we can adjoin so that is co-augmented over .

By small action such a holomorphic disk must lie in a neighborhood of and is hence given by Morse flow trees. There is only one flow line emanating from the minimum in and the flow line generically ends at the minimum of the shifting of , see Figure  . The first equation follows.  To see the twisting co-chain equation, we need to check that where , and . To this end, we consider the boundary of the -dimensional moduli space .

This twisting cochain is always defined, and determines a map: We next consider the question whether . The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for to be Koszul:    Suppose that is locally finite, simply-connected -bimodule. Suppose, in addition, that , then is quasi-isomorphic to and is a Koszul twisted cochain. In other words, the induced DG-algebra map: is a quasi-isomorphism.    In the situation of Theorem  , suppose that is connected and decorated by and that is diffeomorphic to a sphere . Writing , there exists a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras where is the based loop space of .  We first note that there exists a quasi-isomorphism since is an exact Lagrangian. We next use Theorem   and Adams’ cobar equivalence (): which holds for the simply-connected topological space .  Theorem   is obtained as a corollary of Theorem   and the following result:    Suppose that . Then, there exists a quasi-isomorphism of augmented -algebras: such that  Note that if is subcritical, or more generally a flexible Weinstein manifold.  We construct an functor where are constructed by dualizing the components of the map . More explicitly, given and , write as in , and define The proof that is an functor follows as in the proof of Proposition  .  Now, we need to check that is a quasi-isomorphism. In the case that , this is a consequence of the exact sequence for wrapped Floer cohomology induced by the subdivision of the complex into high and low energy generators: as follows. In terms of the version of wrapped Floer cohomology presented in Section  , the low energy sub-complex is generated by Lagrangian intersection points in , where and is the first parallel copy of , shifted by a positive Morse function that increases in the end, see Section  . The differential on counts holomorphic strips which is incoming along and outgoing along at the output puncture. Similarly, the high energy quotient is generated by Reeb chords connecting to , the differential counts holomorphic strips interpolating between such Reeb chords. Since is acyclic it follows that the connecting homomorphism is an isomorphism. In order to connect this to and , renumber the parallel copies so that now lies in the negative Reeb direction of at infinity and the shifting function is replaced by . Then note that since is labeled by the following holds.  The linear dual of is canonically identified with as a chain complex (Note that also has an coalgebra structure as defined in and this should dualize to the algebra structure on but we do not need that here).  The linear dual of is canonically identified with as a chain complex.  The linear dual of the connecting homomorphism can be canonically identified with the map on critical points that counts strips with an input puncture at and output puncture at a Reeb chord and is the canonical map on .  Since the connecting homomorphism is an isomorphism so is its linear dual. (The argument here is originally due to Seidel, compare .)  In the case that the argument just given applies after certain deformation that we describe next. For components in , and are defined via parallel copies shifted in the positive Reeb direction at infinity. To connect to the previous case we consider a Lagrangian cobordism of two cylinders which is constant and which is the trace of an isotopy pushing across in the negative Reeb direction. Then the intersection points of the two cylinders are in natural 1-1 correspondence between the short Reeb chords between and . Furthermore, it is straightforward to show that there is exactly one transverse holomorphic strip connecting each intersection point to the corresponding Reeb chord at the negative end of the cobordism.  Adding these cylinders to we get a 1-parameter family of pairs of Lagrangian submanifolds and , where is a gluing parameter that measures the length of the trivial cobordism between and the added cylinders. The wrapped Floer cohomology is acyclic and is generated by the set of long Reeb chords from to , the set of intersection points between the cylinders, and intersection points in . Let denote the short Reeb chords connecting to and recall the natural 1-1 correspondence above. Let be We claim that the following sets are in natural 1-1 correspondence for all sufficiently large :  Rigid strips of and with input puncture at and output puncture at .  Rigid strips of with input puncture at and output puncture at and rigid strips of with input puncture in and output puncture at .  Rigid strips of with input puncture at and output puncture at and rigid strips of with input puncture at and positive puncture at .  To see this note first that the strips in are unaffected by adding the almost trivial cobordism. For , in the limit the disks limits to an anchored disk with a positive puncture and a puncture at the intersection point. Gluing the basic strip connecting the intersection point to the short Reeb chord to it gives a 1-dimensional moduli space. The other boundary component of this moduli space consists of a rigid strip in the cobordism and a disk of dimension one in either symplectization end. Since the only rigid strips in the cobordism with negative ends at Reeb chords are either close to trivial strips or a basic strip it follows that the other end must be a trivial strip followed by a strip connecting to in the negative symplectization end. For we note that every rigid strip must break under stretching into two rigid strips. Since the only rigid strips in the upper part are the basic strips the claim follows.  Observe that the strips in and contribute to and the strips in to the differential on . The vanishing of the wrapped Floer cohomology of then implies that is a quasi-isomorphism. The last statement follows from Proposition  .  [(OF THEOREM  )]{} Note that the quasi-isomorphism given in Theorem   induces a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras by an application of with respect to length filtrations on the bar construction.  By the locally finiteness and simply-connectedness assumptions, each of these bar constructions are locally finite. So, we can apply the linear dual operation to get a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras: The result then follows as in Theorem   where locally finiteness of the grading enabled us to appeal to Lemma  . Therefore, the quasi-isomorphism given in induces the quasi-isomorphism: as required.  Note that the algebras and are finite rank -bimodules (in particular, they are locally finite), thus we can consider their -duals which are, by definition, the -coalgebras and . However, unless we have the simply-connectedness assumption, the quasi-isomorphism does not necessarily dualize to an -comap because comaps are required to factorize through inclusion of the corresponding direct sum into the direct product as in . This is to ensure that -coalgebra maps induces a DG-algebra map on the cobar construction. If we drop this condition, we can observe that the -quasi isomorphism dualizes to DG-algebra map and this is just the map induced by the twisting cochain .  By the universal property of completion, this induces a DG-algebra map  Now, since is a quasi-isomorphism, by using the length filtration on , and appealing to , we can conclude the following.    Suppose that , then there exists a quasi-isomorphism of DG-algebras  Note that the completion is in general a cruder invariant than both and . Though, we always have a map Theorem   can be used to compute in a variety of cases. For example, if is connected Lagrangian filling decorated by of a Legendrian which is diffeomorphic to a sphere , then writing , then we have a quasi-isomorphism since is an exact Lagrangian. Hence, we have a map Here the right hand side can often be computed, in particular is the group ring of the unipotent completion of the fundamental group (cf. ).  In particular, any information on the completion map can help to obtain information about . We will see an application of this idea in the next section.  We end this section with a discussion of the twisting cochains constructed above from an after surgery perspective. Assume that all components of are spheres and recall the surgery isomorphism of Conjecture  . Let , where is the identity map on components in and the map of Theorem  . We next note that there is a natural -algebra map where we identify with the Floer cohomology of the manifold after surgery obtained by capping off all boundary spheres in by disks. (Note that the shifting Morse function then extends with a unique minimum in each disk which gives an idempotent corresponding to .)  The map is defined by a curve count. Fix systems of parallel copies of and of . Let be a word of Reeb chords of and let be a word of intersection points of . Let and define    We require here that the parallel copies give a system of parallel copies of near the surgery region such that for the components of labeled by (resp. ) the induced parallel copies lies in the negative (resp. positive) Reeb direction. Compare Figure  .  The map is a map of -algebras and , where is the strict unit in and is the dual of the unit in if and the unit in if .  This follows as usual by identifying terms contributing to the -relations with the oriented boundary of an oriented 1-manifold and Theorems  ,  ,  .  To compute note that we can represent as the minimum of the shifting Morse function of and note that there is a unique flow line from this minimum to the intersection point and a unique flow line in from the intersection point to the minimum in . The corresponding holomorphic disk starts at the intersection point between and , has two corners at and , and ends at the intersection point in corresponding to the minimum of the shifting Morse function.  The pre-twisting cochain can now be seen to arise via SFT-stretching as follows. Consider the first component of the -map above and a holomorphic disk contributing to it. Now stretch the lower end of the cobordism. Then by SFT-compactness the curves contributing to breaks up into a curve contributing to the map followed by the twisting cochain at each negative puncture. Noting that are the only low energy generators, it follows that the map induces a map of the high energy quotient into and we can write the induced map as .">

As explained we cannot directly calculate the twisting cochain into the Legendrian coalgebra with coefficients in chains of the based loop space. We can however calculate the corresponding twisting cochain when we replace chains on the based loop space with the Morse theory of parallel copies for the components decorated by a positive sign. To carry out the calculation we pick a Morse function on the component with on minimum and a maximum . We place them on the circle and choose parallel copies as shown in Figure  . The parallel copies algebra is where we use notation for Reeb chords and Floer cohomology generators as in Section  . The differential is Passing to means dividing out by the cokernel of the coaugmentation that takes to . This gives the algebra and the differential becomes  The twisting cochain is induced from a map that counts holomorphic disks with one positive puncture and boundary on , and with several punctures at Lagrangian intersection points in the compact part, see . In the current example it is straightforward to find these disk. Note first that by general properties, see Proposition  , where is the idempotent corresponding to the minimum of the shifting Morse function on . The holomorphic disk corresponds to a Morse flow line connecting to . We next consider and . Consider first the moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with a positive puncture at and boundary on . As in the case of the unknot this moduli space sweeps . On both and the shifting functions have one critical point, on it is a minimum and on a maximum. The maximum is constraining for the map into the linear dual of , whereas the minimum is not. We find that  The space give further information of the twisting co-chain as follows. Note that as the evaluation map hits the double point one can glue on a constant disk. These broken disks are also the boundary of the 1-dimensional moduli spaces and . The other end of these moduli spaces correspond to broken disks with one level in the symplectization, a disk in in the former case and in in the latter, and two disks one in and one in attached at its negative end. The last disks contribute to and we conclude that Finally, we compute . Since is a small chord corresponding to a critical point at infinity of the shifting Morse function the only contributions to comes from small holomorphic disks that are controlled by the Morse theory. It is straightforward to check that the only rigid disk corresponds to a flow line in connecting to the intersection point and that this flow line corresponds to a holomorphic triangle in . It follows that  The actual twisting co-chain takes the cokernel of the co-augmentation into the cokernel of the co-units.

We will see that duality holds between the wrapped and the compact Fukaya categories of the symplectic manifold obtained by plumbing the collection of according to the tree . As usual, we take the pre-surgery perspective. Hence, consider a handle decomposition of each with a unique top-dimensional -handle. Removing this handle, we get manifolds with spherical boundary . Let be the subcritical Weinstein manifold obtained by plumbing the cotangent bundles according to the tree . We take the plumbing region to be away from the boundary of . Write for the Legendrian in the boundary of the subcritical Weinstein manifold which is filled by the Lagrangian . Equip the components of with either or labeling.    If and is simply-connected for each , then and are Koszul dual.  Consider first the case . Pick a handle decomposition of without - and -handles. The existence of such a handle decomposition is equivalent to simply-connectivity in high dimensions by the work of Smale. Consider the corresponding Weinstein handle decomposition of . Attaching a -handle alters the Legendrian boundary by surgery and adds Reeb chords in the co-core sphere of the handle of grading and it follows that all Reeb chords of have grading . To construct , we perform a version of boundary connected sum as follows. For each edge in we pick a -ball with two transversely intersecting Lagrangian disks that intersect the boundary sphere in a standard Legendrian Hopf link . We then make boundary connected sum adding to join the according to the tree. This adds Reeb chords of index in the boundary connected sum handles and further Reeb chords corresponding to the Reeb chords of each Hopf link, which effectively has four Reeb chords: two Reeb chords connecting the unknot components to themselves of grading and two mixed Reeb chords connecting distinct components. We can pick gradings so that the gradings of these two mixed chords are and for any , where the first Reeb chord goes from the component closest to priori fixed root of the tree to the one further from it and the other in the opposite direction. Taking between and we find that is simply connected as is . The result then follows from Theorem  .  For , we can stabilize by multiplying by as described in Remarks   and   to get 1-reduced versions of the Legendrian and Lagrangian algebras and then use the above argument.  Finally for , the assumptions of Theorem   does not hold but we recall from Remark   that to apply the duality result from Theorem   all we really need is that is locally finite. This is easily seen to be the case in our case, since the plumbing is according to a tree (which by definition has no cycles) and for any word of Reeb chords that do not consist of connecting Reeb chords going away from the root of the tree the grading has to increase with the size of the word. Alternatively, in this case we know by Perelman’s theorem that we can take as a link of standard Legendrian spheres linked according to the tree as Hopf links and can be seen to be locally finite directly.  The case corresponds to plumbing of copies of . This case was studied in and a version of the duality result still holds, at least when . However, the above argument fails in that case and a more complicated argument using an additional grading is used in . Also a set of examples for are studied in , where the plumbing tree is a star and the corresponding symplectic manifolds is a punctured torus. The duality still holds in this case, even though this is a plumbing of ’s (not simply-connected). The proof of duality given in uses homological mirror symmetry.">

Let us first consider the case when is marked . With respect to the standard choice of orientation datum, the Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra is then given by the free algebra and the non-trivial part of the differential can be read from Figure   as follows:  It is well known that has an exact Lagrangian torus filling. (In fact, there are at least five of them, see ). Any of these can be obtained by doing surgery (pinch move) at , and in some order. Corresponding augmentations are given by their values subject to the condition:  Note that since is not simply-connected, Theorem   does not apply here. In fact, duality does not hold in this example. However, Theorem   shows that there is a quasi-isomorphisms of completions where the latter is a power series ring in two commuting variables concentrated in degree 0.  Thus, the completion map composed with the twisting cochain gives an algebra map: We claim that this map is injective. Indeed, observe that is a commutative algebra: and thus, commutes with in homology. Using this, one shows similarly that commutes with and , see . Hence, we have a completion map from a commutative ring to its completion It is a well known theorem, known as Krull intersection theorem, in commutative algebra that for any commutative Noetherian ring which is an integral domain the completion map is injective. Thus, even though duality fails in this example, partial information can still be obtained by considering completions.  We next describe the twisting cochain for one of the Lagrangian fillings of . More precisely, we choose the filling which is obtained by pinching first at , then at , then at , and finally filling the resulting unknots with Lagrangian disks, see . We think of the Lagrangian filling in as two disks connected by three twisted bands corresponding to the three pinchings. We next consider moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with boundary in . Here gives a description in terms of Morse flow trees which gives the following:   consists of one disk, .   consists of two disks, and .   consists of two disks, and  The boundaries of these disks are as follows.   is fiber in the first twisted band.   is a fiber in the second twisted band, and runs across the first and the second twisted band.   is a fiber in the third twisted band, and runs across the second and the third twisted bands.  We next describe the moduli spaces , in a completely analogous manner. The space has four components, all diffeomorphic to intervals, as follows:   with one boundary point the disk in with attached, and the other the disk in with , , and attached.   with one boundary point the disk in with attached, and the other the disk in with , , and attached.   with one boundary point the disk in with attached, and the other the disk in with , , and attached.   with one boundary point the disk in and the other the disk in with , , and attached.  Here the disks in sweeps the right hand disk of , whereas the evaluation maps of , does not map surjectively onto either disk. The moduli space also has four components only one of which sweeps the left hand disk of .  In order to compute the Floer cohomology we pick a Morse function with one maximum and two saddle points and . Letting the maximum lie in the right hand disk we find: since the only way to rigidify a disk of dimension one is that its boundary passes the maximum .  The twisting cochain can now in principle be computed from the moduli spaces described above by attaching flow trees. To get an algebraically feasible twisting co-chain we first arrange the perturbation scheme so that where the first term is with a flow line and the second with a flow tree, and next so that the disk with a flow line contributes, other contributions cancel (the disk with two flow lines and the same disk with a flow tree, the two distinct disks with one flow lines). Remaining parts of the twisting cochain are now determined from the co-product in the Floer homology: the twisting cochain equation, and the sweeping property of , as follows: and It is possible to check that these power series agree with the geometric count. We leave out the details but describe the mechanism. In order to arrange that only one flow line can be attached to we order the stable manifolds of the flow line of the parallel copies so that if a flow line (or flow tree) between copy and is attached then following we already passed all intersections with stable manifolds between copy and for . Now, if the disk intersects the collection of stable manifolds in the opposite direction this means that we can jump down in all ways, which then gives the desired power series.  We finish this section by a brief discussion of the case decorated by and parallel copies. As usual this introduces two extra generators in addition to the Reeb chords above in , , and , , where is the counit corresponding to the minimum of the shifting function and is the maximum. In the reduced coalgebra (disregarding ) we get the new differential (using the augmentation above to change coordinates): In this case is defined instead by choosing a shifting function that increases at infinity, and is generated by the unit , and , with . The new twisting cochain is and is exactly as above, after the substitutions , .">

<outline text="Basic results for moduli spaces" _note="Consider as above a Weinstein manifold with an exact Lagrangian submanifold , which outside a compact agrees with the positive part of the symplectization of the contact manifold with Legendrian submanifold . We assume that the Maslov class of vanishes and that is relatively spin. We will consider several versions of boundary punctured holomorphic disks with boundary on . The most basic disks we consider will lie either in or in the symplectization . We call the former FILLING DISKS and the latter SYMPLECTIZATION DISKS. We will also consider a more general setting where, like in the symplectization, disks may have both positive and negative punctures. Here we assume that is a Weinstein cobordism with negative end and positive end , where is a contact manifold and is a Legendrian submanifold. More specifically we will consider a Lagrangian with positive end and empty negative end and a Lagrangian with negative end and empty positive end. We further assume that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the components of of and of , , and that corresponding components and intersect transversely in one point and that if . We call disks in COBORDISM DISKS.  Following , all symplectization and cobordism disks we consider will be anchored. This means that the actual disks we consider have, except for their boundary punctures, also additional interior punctures where the maps are asymptotic to Reeb orbits at the negative end. An anchored disk is such a disk completed by rigid holomorphic planes in at all its negative interior punctures, see Figure  . We will count rigid disks as well as use moduli spaces of disks to parameterize chains of boundary paths which then requires studying anchored disks. Although, standard arguments using classical methods allow us to prove transversality for the disks with boundary punctures that we consider, anchored disks requires transversality and gluing also for holomorphic planes in and that requires an abstract perturbation scheme. We will not enter any detailed discussion of this subject in this paper, but would like to point out that any of the approaches could be used to prove the required abstract perturbation results and the results that we establish in this paper are independent of the detailed nature of the perturbation scheme.

We first discuss numberings that determine the boundary conditions of our holomorphic disks. Let denote the unit disk in the complex plane with boundary punctures . One of the boundary punctures is distinguished. We choose notation so that is distinguished. The punctures subdivides the boundary of into boundary arcs. We will consider disks with numbered boundary arcs where the numbers correspond to the parallel copies . We will consider two types of numberings INCREASING and DECREASING: traversing the boundary of the disk in the positive direction starting from the distinguished puncture, the numbering increases or remain constant respectively decreases or remain constant as we pass the other punctures. We call punctures where the numbering changes non-constant and punctures where it does not change constant. If the boundary numbering has no constant puncture then we call it strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.  We next consider asymptotic conditions at the boundary punctures. There are two basic forms of asymptotics, a puncture is either asymptotic to a Lagrangian intersection point or to a Reeb chord. The former case is the standard form of asymptotics on Lagrangian Floer theory and the latter in Legendrian DG-algebras. More precisely, we choose an almost complex structure on which in the cylindrical end is invariant under -translation, leaves the contact planes invariant and is compatible with the symplectic form induced on the contact planes by the contact form. Furthermore, it pairs the -direction with the Reeb direction. This means in particular that the Reeb chord strip which is the product of a Reeb chord and is holomorphic and we study holomorphic disks with boundary punctures that are asymptotic to these Reeb chord solutions.  Consider a disk as above with strictly increasing or decreasing numbering and let be a word of Reeb chords and Lagrangian intersection points in . We let denote the moduli space of holomorphic disks that satisfies the following conditions:   takes the boundary component labeled by to the Lagrangian .   is asymptotic to the unique Reeb chord or Lagrangian intersection point of and near at , where we let .  We next consider disks in the symplectization. Consider again the disk with boundary numbering and punctures . We next note that in the symplectization there are two possible Reeb chord asymptotics, positive or negative according to the sign of the -coordinate near the puncture. Let be a word of signed Reeb chords of , where is a sign. If then we require that the Reeb chords at all constant punctures connect to and that their signs are all negative, . We let denote the moduli space of holomorphic disks that satisfy the following conditions:   takes the boundary components labeled by to the Lagrangian .   is asymptotic at positive or negative infinity according to the sign of to the unique Reeb chord between and near at a puncture .  We write for the moduli space of holomorphic disks satisfying these conditions.  Finally, we consider disks in the cobordism and in the filled cobordism. We start with the cobordism disks without filling. Consider a system of parallel copies . Consider the disk where we fix two punctures that subdivide the boundary of the disk into two arcs, upper and lower. Let be a decreasing boundary numbering of the boundary components in the upper arc and extend it to a constant numbering in the lower arc. Let be a composable word of Reeb chords connecting to , and let be a word of Reeb chords of . Consider the word of Reeb chords and intersection points and let denote the moduli space of holomorphic disks such that the following holds.   is asymptotic to the Reeb chord at its constant puncture, takes adjacent boundary arcs to , and neighboring punctures to the unique intersection point near in and near in , respectively.  On remaining boundary arcs and punctures the boundary maps as described by and the numbering , exactly as above.  The disks in the filled cobordism are entirely analogous. Here we assume that is a Lagrangian submanifold in . Consider again a system of parallel copies and also a system of parallel copies of . Consider the disk where we fix two punctures that subdivide the boundary of the disk into two arcs, upper and lower. Let be a decreasing boundary numbering of the boundary components in the upper and lower arcs. Let be a word of intersection points of and let be a word of Reeb chords of . Consider the word of Reeb chords and intersection points and let denote the moduli space of holomorphic disks such that the following holds.   is asymptotic to the Reeb chord at its puncture in the lower arc, takes adjacent boundary arcs to , and neighboring punctures to the unique intersection point near in and the unique intersection point near in .  On remaining boundary arcs and punctures the boundary maps as described by and the numbering , exactly as above.  The formal dimension of the moduli spaces above is computed in terms of the negative of a Conley-Zehnder index of the Reeb chords. Recall of a Reeb chord of as defined for example in : we pick paths connecting base points in the boundary of the various components of , and paths connecting Reeb chord endpoints to the base points. We define to be the Maslov index of this path closed up by a positive rotation in the contact plane, and the grading . For a Lagrangian intersection between and we similarly pick paths connecting to the base points and use these to form a loop starting in and ending in and define to be the Maslov index of the loop of Lagrangian planes that results from closing up the path of Lagrangian planes along by a positive rotation, and .  The above gradings are related to the grading in the Legendrian contact homology algebra, see e.g. as follows:  The formal dimension of the moduli space equals The formal dimension of the moduli space equals The formal dimension of the moduli space equals The formal dimension of the moduli space equals  See .  We next study topological properties of the moduli spaces just defined. It turns out to be comparatively simple because of two key features. First, since we require our disks to switch copies at punctures “in the same direction” they cannot be multiply covered, and second, for the same reason there can be no boundary splitting. As in , the first property allows us to prove transversality by perturbing the almost complex structure and the second shows that the moduli spaces admit compactifications consisting only of punctured curves joined at Reeb chords. Precise formulations of these results are as follows.    For generic almost complex structure the moduli spaces , , , and are transversely cut out manifolds of dimensions and , , and , respectively.  To see this we note first that if is a disk in one of the moduli spaces then it cannot be multiply covered. We use the argument of . Fix a puncture of . Consider first the more difficult case when this puncture maps to a Lagrangian intersection. Pick coordinates so that the intersection point lies at the origin in and so that the two Lagrangians correspond to and . Let be standard coordinates on . Consider the complex hyperplanes . Looking at the Fourier expansion of near the puncture it is clear that for suitable coordinates (such that the leading Fourier coefficient of lies in direction of the first coordinate) the number of intersection points of the image of and near the puncture have different parities depending on the sign of . By analytic continuation, other disks and half disks mapping there either have images agreeing completely in the ball or there are injective points of the disk near the puncture. In the case where they agree completely we note that the parity of the number of intersection points in each local sheet not containing the puncture with is independent of sign. We the find that we can achieve transversality by perturbing the complex structure near : because the sheet with the puncture intersects only one of , if the contributions of the sheets mapping to cancel then those mapping to cannot cancel and vice versa, by unique continuation.    The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level disks joined at Reeb chords and intersection points, where some levels may lie in the symplectization.  The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level disks joined at Reeb chords.  The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level disks joined at Reeb chords. There is one level of disks in the cobordisms and remaining levels in the symplectization ends.  The moduli space admits a compactification consisting of several level disks joined at Reeb chords and intersection points.  Note that the boundary condition on our punctured disks have the following property: any arc that subdivides the source into two components with a positive puncture in each must connect boundary components numbered with distinct numbers. This shows that there can be no boundary splitting. The theorem then follows from SFT compactness .  We next discuss orientations of moduli spaces following . We fix capping operators at all Reeb chords and Lagrangian intersection points so that the two capping operators there glue to a disk with the Fukaya orientation, see . Recall the relative spin structure on the Lagrangian submanifold induces an orientation on the determinant bundle over the space of disks with boundary condition in the Lagrangian, see. As in we see that these choices then induces a system of coherent orientations on the moduli spaces.  We will use one more property of the moduli spaces which says that they are effectively independent of the increasing or decreasing boundary labeling .    Let and be two increasing (decreasing) boundary numberings. Then there are canonical orientation preserving diffeomorphisms  Let denote either one of the above moduli spaces. This moduli space is the transverse zero set of a Fredholm section in a Banach bundle. Changing the numbering from to corresponds to an arbitrarily small isotopy which induces an arbitrarily small deformation of the section. The theorem follows.">

The domain of partial holomorphic building is a possibly broken disk with decreasing boundary numbering . The partial holomorphic buildings we consider always have exactly one disk in the symplectization. We call it the primary disk of the building. We require that the distinguished puncture which is increasing is a negative puncture of this primary disk. If the distinguished puncture is the only negative puncture of the primary disk then the partial building consist only of its primary component. If on the other hand the primary disk has additional negative punctures then we require that at each additional puncture (which is decreasing or constant) is a disk in the cobordism with decreasing boundary condition is attached at its distinguished increasing or constant puncture to the additional negative puncture. We call these disks the secondary disks of the partial building.

First, Theorem   shows that the operations compose and that they are independent of the choice of decreasing boundary numbering. To see that the relations hold we will as usual identify the terms contributing to them with the boundary of an oriented 1-dimensional compact manifold.  To this end we first consider 1-dimensional moduli spaces of the form , where the distinguished puncture is an intersection point. As usual, the boundary numbering precludes boundary bubbling and we find that the boundary consists of broken disk that either break at an intersection point in which case the holomorphic parts both have dimension zero, or break into a partial holomorphic building with a rigid disk attached at its negative puncture, in which case the primary component of the partial building has dimension one.

    <outline text="Isomorphism with the Hamiltonian version" _note="We next show that the above definition of wrapped Floer cohomology agrees with the standard theory. We keep the geometric setting as above and write for the usual version of Hamiltonian wrapped Floer cohomology. A well known argument shows that that with differential is quasi-isomorphic to the wrapped Floer cohomology by a geometrically defined chain map. We extend this chain map to an -map which then a standard spectral sequence argument establishes the desired isomorphism.  We follow the approach in where similar isomorphisms between contact and symplectic differential graded algebras were constructed. More precisely, as there we construct a splitting compatible non-negative field of -forms with values in Hamiltonian vector fields, and further a -parameter family of such forms interpolating between the zero Hamiltonian at the positive end and the Hamiltonian used to define wrapped Floer cohomology at the negative end, see . We then define the corresponding moduli spaces over the deformation interval.

The analogue of Theorem   holds by the same argument and the corresponding moduli spaces are canonically isomorphic for sufficiently small perturbations.

  <outline text="Wrapped Floer cohomology and Lagrangian handle attachment" _note="In this subsection we discuss the result in which gives a Legendrian surgery description of the wrapped Floer cohomology of a co-core disk in a Weinstein manifold obtained by Lagrangian handle attachment along a Legendrian sphere. To state this result we first introduce notation.  Let be a Weinstein -manifold with ideal boundary the contact -manifold . Let be a Legendrian submanifold such that all of its components are parameterized -spheres. Let be the Weinstein manifold that results from attaching Lagrangian handles to . Here , where each component is a disk sub-bundle of the cotangent bundle of the -disk , and where is attached to . Then contains co-core disks corresponding to the cotangent fibers at the center of the disk in each . We let denote co-core disk in , denote its Legendrian boundary inside the contact boundary of , and write .  As a first step in the calculation of the wrapped Floer cohomology of we describe the generators of the underlying chain complex. By the results in Section  , generators of are of two kinds Lagrangian intersection points and Reeb chords. Here the Lagrangian intersection points are easily understood: pick the shifting Morse function so that it has one minimum on each component of and no other critical points, then there is exactly one intersection point for each component of . We denote the intersection point of by and we denote the subcomplex generated by the by . Remaining generators are Reeb chords of we write for the quotient complex and note that is generated by Reeb chords.  Consider the link and let all components be decorated by minus, . Consider as a chain complex, generated by composable words of Reeb chords with differential and with product given by concatenation if the words are composable and zero otherwise.

For any there exists such that if then there is a natural one to one correspondence between the generators of of action and the generators of of action .  [**Sketch of proof:**]{} It is clear that a Reeb chord connecting to converges to a composable word of Reeb chords, as . To construct a unique chord for each composable word for small handles of size one uses an explicit model of the handle centered around the origin in standard symplectic -space where the Reeb flow corresponds to the solution of a linear differential equation in combination with an elementary finite dimensional fixed point theorem.

Consider the word of Reeb chords and intersection points  Define ,  Note that if is the minimum of the Morse function on as above then because of the unique holomorphic disk corresponding to the flow line from the minimum to the intersection point between , for the parallel copies this gives a triangle with corners at , at , and at , and since there are no negative punctures the output is . Also, and if a word of generators of contains a generator and has length then as this corresponds to a holomorphic disk with a flow line from the minimum attached and such a configuration cannot be rigid unless the disk is constant.    The maps gives an -map which is an quasi-isomorphism.  [**Sketch of proof:**]{} In order to see the -relations we study the boundary of the moduli space . As usual the boundary numbering guarantees that there is no boundary splitting on . The boundary of the moduli space thus consists of the following configurations.  Two level curves with one level in the cobordism and one in either symplectization end.  Curves which split at the intersection point .  Splitting corresponds to the map followed by the operation in . Splitting corresponds to the tensor product of the map followed by the product operation in . The -relations follow.  To see that is a quasi-isomorphism we show that induces an isomorphism on homology by constructing algebraically one holomorphic disks interpolating between a Reeb chord of and the corresponding word of Reeb chords of . The existence of such disks implies that the map has a triangular matrix with respect to the action filtration and hence is a chain isomorphism, compare .  To construct the required interpolating disks one starts from unique and uniformly transversely cut out such disks for single chord words obtained by a straightforward explicit geometric construction. Gluing such disks at their Lagrangian intersection punctures in and using small action to rule out all breakings except one, we find that there is algebraically one disk interpolating between a chord on and the corresponding word of chords of , see . The map being an -quasi-isomorphism then follows from the word length spectral sequence.  A complete proof of Theorem   has not yet appeared. In cases when splitting at Reeb orbits can be neglected it is possible to fill in the details in the above outline with classical techniques. As mentioned above, in the general case one must employ abstract perturbations to control holomorphic planes of anchored disks. The details of the perturbation scheme will not affect the argument.  There is also an “upside-down” perspective on the surgery just described. Namely, one can start from the contact manifold and produce the contact manifold by doing so called -surgery on . In complete analogy with the above one shows that Reeb chords on are in natural one to one correspondence with words of Reeb chords on and one can construct an upside down surgery map of co-algebras: A similar argument also shows that this map is a quasi-isomorphism. Alternatively, one can prove this from the original surgery map using only algebra as follows. First write then since is co-nilpotent, see Section  .">

Let the upper arc contain boundary punctures and is equipped with a decreasing boundary numbering and the lower arc boundary punctures. Let be Reeb chords of and let be Reeb chords of . Let and consider , again as in Figure  .  Theorems   and   show that this moduli space carries a fundamental chain. We view this chain as parametrizing chains of paths in connecting the Reeb chord endpoints in . We write for the alternating word of chains of loops and Reeb chords and view it as an element in . Define the maps as    The map is an -map.  To see that the -relation holds we look at the boundary of the moduli space of dimension . The codimension one boundary consists of three splittings:  A one-dimensional curve splits off in the positive symplectization end.  A one-dimensional curve splits off at the negative end.  Splitting at one of the intersection points .  In order for splittings of the form to contribute to the codimension one boundary of the moduli space the part of the holomorphic building in consists of rigid disks with only positive punctures attached at one puncture to a negative puncture of the disk in the positive end and a disk of dimension in attached at the remaining negative puncture. Assembling the rigid disks and the one-dimensional disk we get a partial holomorphic disk building that contributes to the -operations in followed by the map . Splittings of type corresponds to the map followed by the differential in . Finally splittings of type correspond to the map followed by the product on . We conclude that the terms contributing to -relations express the codimension one boundary of in two different ways and hence is an -map.  We will use slight generalizations of the map below. More precisely, if , are points in and if is the cotangent fiber at then we have a similar surgery map which counts holomorphic disks with a positive Reeb chord connecting to , two Lagrangian intersection punctures at and at , and a word of chains of loops in and Reeb chords of as output, and where is directly analogous to but where the first chain of loops is in a word is replaced by a chain of paths from to the base point and the last is replaced by a chain of paths from the base point to . In this setup the counterpart of the second component is and counts disks with two positive punctures at Reeb chords and two Lagrangian intersection punctures at and . The counterpart of the -equations in this setup is then where is the differential on and where is the (Pontryagin) product . The proofs of these statements are word by word repetitions of the proof of Theorem  .  We next sketch a proof that the map in Theorem   is in fact a quasi-isomorphism, or, in other words, that its first component induces an isomorphism on homology. We filter by action of its Reeb chord generators. To get a corresponding filtration on we use action on Reeb chords in combination with the energy on the loops. We start with a discussion of the energy of loops, following .  Equip with a Riemannian metric and denote the space of based loops in with the supremum norm: for two loops , where is the metric on induced by the Riemannian structure. Then the metric topology on agrees with the standard compact open topology.  Let denote the space of piecewise smooth paths with metric where denotes the derivative of . The natural inclusion is a homotopy equivalence, . We will use finite dimensional approximations to study . The energy of a piece-wise smooth loop in is For , let denote the subset of loops of energy . The space can be approximated by piece-wise geodesic loops. More precisely, fixing a subdivision of we consider the space of loops of energy that are geodesic on each interval . Then shows that for all sufficiently fine subdivisions is a finite dimensional manifold (a submanifold of the product in a natural way). Moreover , all critical points of lie in which is a deformation retract of and for generic metric is a Morse function.  With these preliminaries established we turn to the actual proof. The first step will be to describe the Reeb chords of . Let be a Riemannian metric on as above and let be a positive function with , , and monotone increasing. Define the metric on by  Then if and are points in and is a geodesic with and then there is a unique geodesic such that   and ;   is Morse with has a unique maximum at an interior point .  Note that the Reeb flow in the unit disk bundle is the natural lift of the geodesic flow. Assume next as above that the metric on is generic in the sense that the length functional for curves connecting any two Reeb chord endpoints in has only Morse critical points. Concretely, this means that the index form of any geodesic connecting two Reeb chord endpoints is non-degenerate. As in Lemma  , this allows us to control the Reeb chords of below a given action for all sufficiently thin handles. More precisely, let denote the size of the tubular neighborhood of in where we attach and we introduce the following notion of a geodesic-Reeb chord word. A GEODESIC-REEB CHORD WORD is a word where is a geodesic from one of the base points to the start point of the Reeb chord , where is a geodesic from the endpoint of to the start point of , etc, until finally is a geodesic from the endpoint of the Reeb chord to one of the base points . We define the action of a geodesic-Reeb chord word to be the sum of actions of its Reeb chords and the energies of its geodesics.    For any there exists and such that for any and any there is a natural one to one correspondence between Reeb chords of of action and geodesic-Reeb chord words of of action .  [**Sketch of proof:**]{} The proof uses the transversality of the Reeb chords and of the geodesics. The basic observation is that the point in the normal fiber of where the Reeb flow hits determines the direction of the geodesic in . After introducing a concrete smoothing of corners the lemma then follows from the finite dimensional inverse function theorem.  To show that is a quasi-isomorphism we will show that it is represented by a triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal with respect to the action/energy filtration. To this end we will use the Morse theoretic finite dimensional model for the chain complex underlying the homology of the based loop space described above. In order to have defined as a chain in this model we need to assure that the paths on the boundary of the holomorphic disk are sufficiently well behaved. We only sketch the construction. On holomorphic disk with unstable domains, we fix gauge using small spheres surrounding Reeb chord endpoint, compare . As in we use a configuration space for holomorphic curves consisting of maps with two derivatives in . This means that the restriction to the boundary has derivatives in and in particular the projection to has bounded energy. Since the action of the positive puncture in a holomorphic disk contributing to the differential controls the norm of the solution it follows that we can use configuration spaces of bounded energy to study the disks in the differential: we approximate the boundary curves uniformly by a piecewise geodesic curve by introducing a uniformly bounded number of subdivision points and straight line homotopies in small charts.    The chain-map induces an isomorphism on homology.  [**Sketch of proof:**]{} Consider a word of the form where are geodesics in and where are Reeb chords. We aim to construct algebraically one disk connecting the Reeb chord of , corresponding to this word (see Lemma  ), to the word itself. We use an inductive argument and energy filtration. To start the argument we pick additional fiber disks and in at and for very small near all Reeb chord end points and in . We use the natural counterparts of the for mixed wrapped Floer homologies. For example, there is a straightforward analogue of Lemma  : Reeb chord generators of correspond before the surgery words of the form where is a geodesic connecting the base point of to the startpoint of , from the endpoint of to the start point of , etc. To start the argument we note that it is straightforward to construct holomorphic strips corresponding to the short geodesics starting at followed by the chord and then the short geodesic to and to show that they are unique. This corresponds to a generator of . Likewise, it is immediate to construct the holomorphic disk connecting a Reeb chord generator of corresponding to a geodesic, and show that it is unique, compare Lemma  .  We now use these two to construct algebraically one disk from the Reeb chord generator of corresponding to the short geodesic, the chord , and a geodesic connecting the endpoint of to the base point of . To this end we consider the natural map see . For the two Reeb chords connecting to corresponding to the chord of , and connecting to corresponding to the geodesic we then have (with denoting the base point): Here we know that the terms containing and involves non-trivial holomorphic disks or Morse flows in the finite dimensional approximation and hence lowers action/energy by an amount bounded below by some which we assume is much larger than above. Therefore, if we restrict attention to a small action window we find Here the first term is simply the Pontryagin product at the common endpoint of the curves, which is homologous to the word of the small geodesic, the Reeb chord and then the longer geodesic, by rounding the corner at . It follows that , where is a Reeb chord with action between the sum of the actions of and and the action of and that contains this word with coefficient . Noting that there is only one Reeb chord in the action window studied we find that the desired coefficient equals . It is now clear how to continue the induction, in each step we add one more geodesic or Reeb chord to any word. Using already constructed curves and in a small action window we find that the map has a triangular action matrix with on the diagonal, hence it is a quasi-isomorphism.
