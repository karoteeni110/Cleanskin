<outline text="Introduction" _note="Uncertainty relation is one of the fundamental building blocks of quantum theory, and now plays an important role in quantum mechanics and quantum information . It is introduced by Heisenberg in understanding how precisely the simultaneous values of conjugate observables could be in microspace, i.e., the position and momentum of an electron. Kennard and Weyl proved the uncertainty relation where the standard deviation of an operator is defined by . Later, Robertson proposed the well-known formula of uncertainty relation which is applicable to arbitrary incompatible observables, and the commutator is defined by . The uncertainty relation was further strengthed by Schrödinger with the following form Here the commutator defined as .  It is realized that the traditional uncertainty relations may not fully capture the concept of incompatible observables as the lower bound could be trivially zero while the variances are not. An important question in uncertainty relation is how to improve the lower bound and immune from triviality problem . Various attempts have been made to find stronger uncertainty relations. One typical kind of relation is that of Maccone and Pati, who derived two stronger uncertainty relations where , , and the sign on the right-hand side of the inequality takes while is positive (negative). The basic idea behind these two relations is adding additional terms to improve the lower bound. Along this line, more terms and weighted form of different terms have been put into the uncertainty relations. It is worth mentioning that state-independent uncertainty relations can immune from triviality problem . Recent experiments have also been performed to verify the various uncertainty relations .  Besides the conjugate observables of position and momentum, multiple observables also exist, e.g., three component vectors of spin and angular momentum. Hence, it is important to find uncertainty relation for multiple incompatible observables. Recently, some three observables uncertainty relations were studied, such as Heisenberg uncertainty relation for three canonical observables , uncertainty relations for three angular momentum components , uncertainty relation for three arbitrary observables . Furthermore, some multiple observables uncertainty relations were proposed, which include multi-observable uncertainty relation in product and sum form of variances. It is worth noting that Chen and Fei derived an variance-based uncertainty relation for arbitrary incompatible observables, which is stronger than the one such as derived from the uncertainty inequality for two observables .  In this paper, we investigate variance-based uncertainty relation for multiple incompatible observables. We present a new variance-based sum uncertainty relation for multiple incompatible observables, which is stronger than an uncertainty relation from summing over all the inequalities for pairs of observables . Furthermore, we compare the uncertainty relation with existing ones for a spin- and spin- particle, which shows our uncertainty relation can give a tighter bound than other ones.">

<outline text="Results" _note="For arbitrary observables , , , , the following variance-based uncertainty relation holds The bound becomes nontrivial as long as the state is not common eigenstate of all the observables.  [**Proof:**]{} To derive ( ), start from the equality then using the inequality we obtain the uncertainty relation ( ).QED.  To show that our relation ( ) has a stronger bound, we consider the result in Ref. , the relation ( ) is derived from the uncertainty equality Using the above uncertainty equality, one can obtain two inequalities for arbitrary observables, namely and The bound in ( ) is tighter than the one in ( ) . However, the lower bound in ( ) is not always tighter than the one in ( ) (see Figure  ).  [**Example 1**]{} To give an overview that the relation ( ) has a better lower bound than the relations ( ),( ),( ), we consider a family of qubit pure states given by the Bloch vector , and choose the Pauli matrices Then we have , , and . Similarly, , and . The comparison between the lower bounds ( ),( ),( ) and ( ) is given in Figure  . Apparently, our bound is tighter than ( ) ,( ) and ( ). We shall show with detailed proofs and examples that our uncertainty relation ( ) has better lower bound than that of ( ),( ),( ) in the following sections.">
  <outline text="Comparison between the lower bound of our uncertainty relation ([relation]) with that of inequality ([Maccone3p])" _note="First, we compare our relation ( ) with the one ( ). Note that , the relation ( ) becomes Simplify the above inequality, we obtain which is equal to the relation ( ).  Similarly, by using , our relation ( ) becomes Simplify the above inequality, we get which is equal to the relation ( ). It is easy to see that the right-hand side of ( ) is greater than the right-hand side of ( ). Hence, the relation ( ) is stronger than the relation ( ).">

Then the uncertainty relation ( ) has the form the relation ( ) is given by and the relation ( ) says that We consider a qubit state and its Bloch sphere representation where are Pauli matrices and the Bloch vector is real three-dimensional vector such that . Then we have , . The relation ( ) has the form where we define . And the relation ( ) becomes Let us compare the lower bound of ( ) with that of ( ). The difference of these two bounds is for all . When , the above inequality becomes equality, then the Eq.( ) has the minimum value .

The relation ( ) has the form where we define . Then the difference of these two bounds of relation ( ) and ( ) becomes where we have twice used Cauchy’s inequality. When and , the above inequality becomes equality, then the Eq.( ) has the minimum value . This illustrates that the uncertainty relation ( ) is stronger that the one ( ) for a spin- particle and measurement of Pauli-spin operators .  [**Example 2**]{} For spin-1 systems, we consider the following quantum state characterized by and with . By choosing the three angular momentum operators () the comparison between the lower bounds ( ),( ),( ) and ( ) is shown by Figure  .
