    <title>HD 209458b in New Light: Evidence of Nitrogen Chemistry, Patchy Clouds
and Sub-Solar Water</title>
    <abstract>Interpretations of exoplanetary transmission spectra have been
undermined by apparent obscuration due to clouds/hazes. Debate rages on
whether weak HO features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or
inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar HO abundances have
relied on making a priori model assumptions, e.g. chemical/radiative
equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this problem with a new
retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We introduce POSEIDON, a
two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm including generalised
inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this prescription allows one
to break vital degeneracies between clouds and prominent molecular
abundances. We apply POSEIDON to the best transmission spectrum
presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, uncovering new
insights into its atmosphere at the day-night terminator. We extensively
explore the parameter space with an unprecedented 10 models, spanning
the continuum from fully cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully
Bayesian retrieval framework. We report the first detection of nitrogen
chemistry (NH and/or HCN) in an exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7-7.7
confidence, non-uniform cloud coverage at 4.5-5.4, high-altitude hazes
at 3, and sub-solar HO at 3-5, depending on the assumed cloud
distribution. We detect NH at 3.3 and 4.9 for fully cloudy and
cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model with the highest
Bayesian evidence, we constrain HO at 5-15 ppm (0.01-0.03 solar) and NH
at ppm, strongly suggesting disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning
against equilibrium assumptions. Our results herald new promise for
retrieving cloudy atmospheres using high-precision HST and JWST spectra. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="We stand at the precipice of a new age – one where the vision of characterising exoplanets in exquisite detail is rapidly being realised. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years towards observing various aspects of exoplanetary atmospheres, including chemical signatures , temperature profiles , circulation patterns , clouds/hazes , and escape processes ; for recent reviews see e.g. . Using state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval techniques, it is now also possible to use spectroscopic observations to extract precise constraints on the chemical abundances. Such constraints are just beginning to provide tantalising clues to planetary formation and migration pathways . While a variety of observations have been used to study exoplanetary atmospheres, the majority have focused on transiting hot Jupiters ( K) whose extended atmospheres and favourable geometry make them especially amenable to transit spectroscopy.  The most observed molecule in exoplanetary atmospheres to date is HO. In recent years, the Hubble Space Telescope’s (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) has enabled robust detections of HO in numerous exoplanetary transmission spectra . However, in almost all cases the amplitudes of HO absorption features are significantly lower than those expected of a cloud-free solar-composition atmosphere – typically 2 scale heights instead of 5-10 . Taken at face value, this could imply a plethora of atmospheres inherently depleted in oxygen . Alternatively, they may be explained by invoking a high altitude (1 mbar) opaque cloud deck or uniform-in-altitude grey opacity, such as haze particles . Given the increasing number of low-amplitude or even flat spectra observed the consideration of clouds has been elevated to the forefront of transmission spectroscopy.  The fundamental issue with deriving chemical abundances in cloudy exoplanetary atmospheres lies in innate degeneracies between clouds and chemistry. A wide range of solutions exist, spanning high-altitude clouds with concealed solar abundances and low-altitude, or non-existent, clouds with sub-solar abundances. This naturally leads to extremely loose constraints consistent with the full range from sub-solar through super-solar abundances . It is thus clear that clouds pose an existential challenge to robustly estimating chemical abundances. Most efforts to retrieve atmospheric properties of cloudy atmospheres have employed one-dimensional models – i.e. homogeneous terminator cloud coverage. This is despite predictions from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) that large temperature contrasts of many hundreds of K may fuel a prominence of PARTIALLY CLOUDY terminators on tidally locked hot Jupiters . The effect of partial clouds on transmission spectra retrieval has recently been examined by .  Here, we offer a potential solution to the problem of interpreting transmission spectra of cloudy exoplanets. We introduce POSEIDON, a new atmospheric retrieval algorithm that includes generalised two-dimensional inhomogeneous cloud distributions. By not assuming global cloud coverage across the terminator, regions without clouds are sampled during transmission – effectively allowing one to ‘peer below’ the clouds and break many of the degeneracies between clouds and chemical abundances. The method we propose enables the SIMULTANEOUS retrieval of cloud/haze properties along with precise molecular abundance constraints.  We demonstrate our new retrieval paradigm on the best transmission spectrum available, namely that of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. As the first transiting exoplanet , HD 209458b ignited the fledgling field of exoplanetary atmospheres. Serving as the prototypical target for atmospheric characterisation, it was the first exoplanet observed to contain Na . Various carbon and oxygen-rich molecular species have been claimed in its atmosphere, including , , and . Of these detections, has been robustly verified by WFC3 spectroscopy and by high resolution Doppler spectroscopy .  Constraining abundances of chemical species became possible with the invention of atmospheric retrieval for exoplanets . Retrieval techniques allow atmospheric properties to be derived directly from observational data in a statistically robust manner. Retrieval is now a mature field, with a wide range of codes developed and deployed to analyse atmospheres in transmission , thermal emission and reflected light . The most robust inferences of the molecular abundances to date have been derived from near-infrared spectra obtained by HST WFC3 in the range which contains strong spectral features due to , , and .  The WFC3 transmission spectrum of HD 209458b was first retrieved by . They reported a water abundance of 0.01-0.05 the prediction for a solar abundance atmosphere ( 5), despite a super-solar stellar metallicity of   = . Such low inferred abundances may provide interesting constraints on planetary formation and migration . However, this retrieval assumed a cloud-free atmosphere. revisited this spectrum with a retrieval including clouds, albeit with assumed radiative-convective equilibrium along with a priori C-N-O chemistry, and inferred a composition consistent with solar abundances (also see section  ). This view was further reinforced by , who used transmission spectra of ten hot Jupiters to claim that clouds and hazes, not sub-solar HO, sufficiently explain the spectra. However, this work only considered a small grid of forward models with chemical equilibrium assumed, rather than a retrieval. In another effort, also detected HO but were unable to robustly constrain its abundance. Suggestions of solar abundances have since been called into question. performed retrievals of the datasets and found that nine of their ten planets possess sub-solar water abundances once the assumption of chemical equilibrium is relaxed – with HD 209458b the driest at solar. These competing lines of evidence leaves the question of sub-solar water abundances unsettled.  In this work, we examine these differing conclusions through the application of our two-dimensional retrieval code, POSEIDON. Using a state-of-the-art nested sampling algorithm, we extensively explore the model parameter space in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework with model spectra. Unlike the retrievals of and , we additionally include the nitrogen-bearing molecules and . In what follows, we introduce our retrieval framework in § . We validate POSEIDON using a simulated dataset in § . We retrieve the atmospheric properties of HD 209458b in § . Finally, in §  we summarise our results and discuss the implications.">

<outline text="Atmospheric Retrieval with Inhomogeneous Clouds" _note="Here we introduce POSEIDION, our modelling and retrieval framework for transmission spectra. Extracting atmospheric properties from an observed spectrum involves two components: i) a parametric FORWARD MODEL; ii) a STATISTICAL RETRIEVAL algorithm to sample the model parameter space. Typical forward models assume one-dimensional geometry, i.e. average temperature, composition and cloud properties across the terminator. In this work we generalise the formulation to account for azimuthally inhomogeneous cloud properties.">
  <outline text="Forward Model" _note="Our forward model computes the transmission spectrum of an exoplanet as it transits its host star. We model the day-night terminator of the atmosphere assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and terminator-averaged temperature structure and chemistry. The model allows for inhomogeneous azimuthal cloud and haze distributions. Line-by-line radiative transfer is evaluated under the geometry depicted in Figure  .">
    <outline text="Radiative Transfer" _note="The transmission spectrum of a generalised two-dimensional atmosphere (derived in Appendix  ) is represented by the wavelength-dependant transit depth, , given by where is the transmission spectrum of an axially symmetric atmosphere with the same composition, temperature structure and cloud properties of the atmosphere at polar angle - i.e. the ‘one-dimensional’ transit depth. We approximate this general case by discretising the atmosphere into sectors with different properties, specified by the reduced polar angular extent of the th sector, , (such that ). Note that two sectors with different but similar properties can be grouped into one. The equivalent 1D transit depth of a sector, , is given by Here, and are the observed radii of the planet and star respectively, is the maximal height of the atmosphere considered (corresponding to bar), is the impact parameter and is the optical depth encountered by a ray at a given impact parameter. Equation   can be intuitively understood: the first term is achromatic absorption due to an opaque disk of radius , the second is absorption due to the annulus of the atmosphere and the third is a correction term accounting for rays that have sufficiently small to transmit thorough the atmosphere below the observed planetary radius. Though the correction term for rays with is often neglected, it must be considered for transmission spectra with two-dimensional clouds – the observed transit radius represents the average radius at which the planet becomes opaque, which can differ considerably from the local opaque radius in sectors with low opacity (see Figure  ). Note that Equation   reduces to Equation   in the case . In this work we consider only models with , leaving the more general case reserved for future work.  To evaluate Equation  , we require the optical depth where is the EXTINCTION coefficient, is the ray path length through the atmosphere and we have suppressed the sector subscript . The extinction is in turn a function of the chemistry and cloud properties in each layer where and are the number density and absorption cross section of the species, is the binary absorption coefficient due to collisionally-induced absorption between species and and is the extinction due to clouds and hazes (defined in section  ). Each of these quantities are written as functions of the radial coordinate , which is short-hand for the pressure and temperature in each layer at which the cross sections are computed. In order to evaluate the total extinction, we thus must specify the pressure-temperature (P-T) profile of the atmosphere.">

    <outline text="Pressure-Temperature Profile" _note="We divide our model atmosphere into 100 layers spaced uniformly in log-pressure between bar and bar. The temperature in each layer is computed via the parametric P-T profile equations given in where and are the pressure and temperature at the top of the atmosphere, and are specified at layer boundaries and and specify the conditions at the (potential) temperature inversion point. The temperature slopes are controlled by and . This profile is generic and can include thermal inversions. However, in transmission there is no source function (i.e. thermal emission), which means inversions are unphysical. We account for this taking .  Once and are specified in each layer, the total number density, , and are determined by the ideal gas law and hydrostatic equilibrium. This requires a reference pressure, , to be specified, which we take to be the pressure at which . The gravitational field follows an inverse square law over radial distance with and for HD 209458b. We further assume a dominated atmosphere with mean molecular weight per particle . Taking into account continuity at boundaries, and considering only average terminator profiles, our parametric P-T profile is specified by 7 parameters: ().">

    <outline text="Chemistry" _note="We consider the main chemical species regarded as spectrally active between in hot Jupiter atmospheres: and . We quantify the abundance of each chemical species by its mixing ratio: , which we assume to be uniform in the observable atmosphere. We ascribe a single mixing ratio for each species in the day-night terminator region of the atmosphere – effectively corresponding to the average limb abundance.  The molecular cross sections are pre-computed line-by-line following the methodology outlined in and Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan (submitted). We use the latest theoretical and experimental line lists available, drawing from the HITEMP database for and and EXOMOL for , HCN and . The pre-computed cross sections are binned down to a resolution of 1 on a pre-defined temperature and pressure grid ranging from bar and K. Given a P-T profile, POSEIDON interpolates these cross sections linearly in log-pressure and temperature to those in each atmospheric layer. Figure   shows the resulting molecular cross sections at a representative temperature and pressure of K and bar. For and , we use the cross sections used in , based on semi-analytic Lorentzian line profiles, which will be replaced with more accurate cross sections in future work. For collisionally-induced absorption, we consider and absorption from the HITRAN database .">

    <outline text="A Generalised 2D Cloud/Haze Prescription" _note="Correctly modelling exoplanet transmission spectra requires the inclusion of clouds and hazes. We consider ‘cloudy’ regions of our atmosphere to consist of an opaque cloud deck at pressures and scattering due to hazes above the clouds . The extinction is given by  where is a reference wavelength (here, 350 nm), is the -Rayleigh scattering cross section at the reference wavelength (), is the ‘Rayleigh-enhancement factor’ and is the ‘scattering slope’. The first term in Equation   accounts for scattering due to high-altitude hazes, whilst the second term models the sharp cut-off in transmission due to the high optical depths encountered inside clouds in the transit geometry .  POSEIDON accounts for the possibility of generalised azimuthally-dependant terminator cloud coverage (Figure  ). In this work, we take in Equation   and consider region 1 to contain clouds/hazes according to Equation   and region 2 to be clear. In this limit, we recover the ‘patchy cloud’ case given in where we have defined , , and used to make the correspondence clear. The reduced polar angle then encodes the total terminator cloud coverage (though the cloud need not be distributed continuously with a sharp boundary at the clear interface). In clear regions, we arbitrarily set (in order to ensure it has no effect on the transmission spectrum) and consider scattering in the visible to be solely due to molecular - using the cross section given in .  Figure   shows the effect of varying our cloud-parameters () on a default fiducial transmission spectrum (blue) generated by the POSEIDON forward model. The top panels demonstrate that and encode the strength and slope, respectively, due to scattering, which tends to manifest most prominently at visible wavelengths . In contrast, the altitude of the opaque cloud and the cloud coverage along the terminator strongly influence spectra across both the optical and infrared. Raising the cloud deck (lowering ) results in an increased transit depth at all wavelengths, as the surface is pushed to progressively higher altitudes. As , the base-level of the spectrum becomes increasingly flat until the one-dimensional limit of a uniform cloud acting to shrink the transmitting annulus of the atmosphere is recovered.  With the combination of temperature structure, chemistry and cloud properties now all specified, Equation   can be computed and the transmission spectra evaluated. By specifying this model in terms of parameters, a large ensemble of spectra can be evaluated for different atmospheric properties. We now turn to the essence of retrieval: the usage of a statical algorithm to extract atmospheric properties.">

  <outline text="Statistical Retrieval" _note="Ultimately, we are interested in extracting the underlying properties of an exoplanet atmosphere – i.e, the values of the parameters underlying the forward model (P-T profile, chemistry, clouds etc.) – from observed transmission spectra. An additional question one must assess is the suitability of the forward model itself in light of the data. These two tasks, parameter estimation and model comparison, can be accomplished within a Bayesian framework.  The basic architecture of our retrieval algorithm is depicted in Figure  . The atmosphere is encoded by a vector of underlying physical parameters. For a given parameter combination, the forward model outputs a spectrum that is convolved with relevant instrument point spread functions (PSF) and/or integrated over the respective instrument functions to produce predicted data points. At each point in parameter space, these predicted data points, denoted by , are compared with the observed data points, , to compute the likelihood of the given set of parameters. The likelihood in turn informs the choice of the next set of parameters by the statistical retrieval algorithm, depicted on the right of Figure  . The algorithm allows thorough exploration of the entire multi-dimensional parameter space and computation of the Bayesian evidence – which quantifies the suitability of the model itself. POSEIDON employs a nested sampling algorithm to accomplish this purpose.  We proceed to summarise the parametrisation of our forward model in section  , define the statistical aspects and terminology of atmospheric retrieval in section   and, finally, describe the nested sampling statistical algorithm employed by POSEIDON in section  .">
    <outline text="Atmospheric Parametrisation" _note="In this implementation, the POSEIDON forward model is described by up to 16 parameters: 7 for the terminator P-T profile, 5 for the terminator chemistry () and a 4-parameter cloud/haze description. The allowed range and Bayesian prior used for each parameter are given in Table  . Note that we have restricted our choice of molecules to those expected to dominate absorption in the WFC3 bandpass (see Figure  ), thus the retrieval results we present do not include and . We have further elected not to describe the K abundance by an additional parameter, given the simplicity of our current alkali cross section implementation, instead fixing the K/Na ratio to the solar value (). Since we focus on hot Jupiters, we assume a dominated atmosphere with a fixed ratio of 0.17.

We elect for generous ‘uninformative’ priors. A uniform prior probability distribution (section  ) is ascribed to parameters expected to vary by less than two orders of magnitude, whilst a uniform-in-the-logarithm prior is used for parameters expected to vary over many orders of magnitude. We elect in this initial work to restrict ourselves to atmospheric sectors, in which case only 1 parameter, , is required to describe two-dimensional effects. An additional subtlety in the choice of these priors must be made explicit: since both the mixing ratios and the reduced polar extent are subject to the constraint of addition to unity, in the most general case a flat Dirchlet prior (uniform over a simplex subspace) is most appropriate. Here we use the fact that we know a priori that the dominant component of hot Jupiter atmospheres is to treat the remaining gases as trace species with log-uniform priors – this assumption must be relaxed for high mean molecular weight atmospheres, such as those of super-Earths . Similarly, for a two-sector atmosphere we need only ascribe a single uniform parameter , with the extent of the second sector automatically specified by the unity summation condition.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Bayesian Framework" _note="Consider a set of forward models described by an underlying set of physical parameters . Our a priori expectations on the values of the parameters are encoded in the PRIOR PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION: . By obtaining a set of observations , we can formally update our knowledge on the values of these parameters via Bayes’ theorem where in the equivalency we have defined the conventional notation for the LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION, , prior, , and BAYESIAN EVIDENCE, . The quantity on the left-hand side is the POSTERIOR PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION, which quantifies our knowledge on the values of the parameters of model following an observation. The priors for each parameter are given in Table  , whilst the likelihood – a measure of the plausibility of the forward model producing the observed data for a choice of model parameters – is given, for observations with independently distributed Gaussian errors, by where are the set of (binned) model data points produced by convolving the output of the forward model with the relevant instrument PSFs and integrating over the corresponding instrument functions.  The Bayesian evidence is the key quantity employed in Bayesian model comparison. From Equation  , we see that it is simply the normalising factor that ensures the integral of the posterior probability density over the entire parameter space evaluates to unity The value of the evidence can be qualitatively understood as a ‘figure of merit’ that is maximised by models with a high likelihood in a compact parameter space . To see this, consider the addition of a new parameter to a model. By extending the dimensionality of the parameter space, the value of the prior probability density will be diluted across this additional volume. The evidence for this more complex model will then only increase if the new volume contains previously unsampled regions of high likelihood. In contrast to simply fitting a spectrum, the Bayesian evidence provides an automatic implementation of Occam’s Razor by penalising models with unjustified complexity.  The quantitative utility of the evidence becomes clear when using Bayes’ theorem to consider the relative probability of two competing models in light of the data where in the equivalency we have defined the BAYES FACTOR for model vs. model . We assume the final factor, expressing their a priori odds ratio, to be unity. Thus the ratio of the evidences between two models allows the adequacy of the models themselves to be assessed. Values of at least are often interpreted as ‘weak’, ‘moderate’ and ‘strong’ detections in favour of over . The Bayes factor can in turn be related to the commonly used frequentist measure of sigma-significance , which we also communicate when presenting Bayes factors during model comparison.  Once an adequate model is identified via Bayesian model comparison, one can then constrain the parameters within the chosen model. This is accomplished by drawing samples from the posterior (Equation  ) and marginalising (integrating) over the full range of the other parameters. The resulting probability density histograms for each parameter encode our knowledge of the underlying physics of the atmosphere. Strictly speaking, the Bayesian evidence is not required if parameter estimation is the only goal (as only normalises the posterior), though the implicit assumption in this case is that the model itself is ‘correct’.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Nested Sampling" _note="The statistical algorithms employed by retrieval codes are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Early retrievals used grid-based parameter space exploration or optimal estimation techniques that do not allow for full marginalisation of the posterior. Rigorous parameter estimation in a Bayesian framework was enabled by the integration of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms into retrieval codes . However, these techniques do not permit a computationally efficient evaluation of the multi-dimensional integral in Equation  , and so renders Bayesian model comparison challenging. Atmospheric retrieval is currently undergoing a phase-transition, with the technique of nested sampling – which allows efficient computation of both the Bayesian evidence in addition to providing posterior samples for parameter estimation – now utilised in the majority of applications .  POSEIDON implements the multimodal nested sampling algorithm MultiNest via the Python wrapper PyMultiNest . MultiNest computes the Bayesian evidence numerically by transforming Equation   to a one-dimensional integral; evaluated by sweeping through progressively increasing iso-likelihood contours containing a set of ‘live points’ drawn from progressively shrinking ellipsoids. The full history of these samples serves to widely chart the posterior – see for a detailed discussion of the algorithm. A notable strength of MultiNest in the context of atmospheric retrieval is its ability to navigate significantly non-Gaussian, degenerate and non-trivially curved posteriors, in addition to being fully parallelised for cluster computing.  By coupling the POSEIDON forward model to MultiNest, we are able to assess the plausibility of a wide variety of physical phenomena (e.g. detections of chemical species, hazes, clear vs. cloud-free atmospheres). For each model, we derive the posterior probability distributions of the underlying parameters, which typically requires the evaluation of many millions of spectra to obtain robust parameter estimates. Now that our retrieval framework has been established, we proceed to demonstrate its effectiveness.">

<outline text="Validation" _note="There are two key steps to validate a retrieval code: i) verify that the forward model outputs correct spectra; ii) successfully retrieve the atmospheric state underlying a simulated dataset produced by the forward model. Tests of this manner enable the accuracy and reliability of a retrieval code to be established, as well as bringing to light any potential biases or degeneracies in the results that could impact the interpretation of real spectra.">
  <outline text="Forward Model Validation" _note="Prior to the generation of a simulated dataset, we undertook an internal comparison between the POSEIDON forward model and that utilised in . Though the radiative transfer schemes and parametric P-T profiles in both models are identical, to make a direct comparison the cloud and haze parametrisation built into POSEIDON was set to a cloud-free atmosphere (i.e. ) and we temporarily replaced our new cross sections with those employed in . We tested our model over a range of parameters, finding only a minor offset () in the transit depth due to the higher order numerical methods employed by POSEIDON.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Retrieval Validation" _note="We now proceed to demonstrate the typical results from an application of the POSEIDON retrieval code to a given dataset. The goal here is to start with a synthetic data set, based on a known model spectrum, and use POSEIDON to retrieve the underlying model parameters. This allows us to test how well the parameters can be obtained.  We first generated a high-resolution fiducial solar-composition transmission spectrum, using the planetary properties of HD 209458b. The P-T profile parameters were chosen to produce a monotonically decreasing temperature with altitude, such that the temperature in the photosphere ( bar) is around that of the planetary equilibrium temperature ( K). We ascribed a cloud coverage of 40 per cent to the terminator, with cloudy regions consisting of a high altitude opaque cloud deck at 0.1 mbar subsumed in a uniform-with-altitude haze. The values of the physical parameters used to produce the spectrum are given in the embedded table in Figure  .  With the spectrum generated, we produced a simulated dataset at a precision commensurate with currently available observations. We first convolved the high-resolution spectrum with the relevant PSFs for the HST STIS (G430/G750) and WFC3 (G141) instruments and integrated over the corresponding instrument functions to produce a set of low-resolution binned spectral points at the same wavelength locations as the HD 209458b data given in . We added Gaussian errors at the levels of 120ppm and 40ppm in the visible and near-infrared respectively to produce simulated STIS and WFC3 data points. The combined dataset served as the input to POSEIDON.  We initialised multiple nested sampling runs with 1,000-8,000 live points in order to confirm consistency. To efficiently compute the millions of models required to adequately explore the entire 16 dimensional parameter space, we evaluated transmission spectra at 2000 wavelengths uniformly spaced over the range 0.2-2.0 . We show the full posterior for the retrieval with 4,000 live points in Figure  . We find that this number of live points offers an optimum trade-off between minimising the error in the computed Bayesian evidence () and optimising the overall time necessary to reach the convergence criteria.  The median retrieved spectrum shows excellent agreement with the true spectrum. Figure   shows that they are coincident throughout the spectral range 0.3-2.0 to &amp;lt; 40ppm precision – even where there is limited data coverage. The WFC3 bandpass is constrained even more tightly, typically to &amp;lt; 20ppm precision. The only region of significant deviation is in the UV below 0.3 , where there are no data points to inform the retrieval.  The true P-T profile agrees with median retrieved profile to &amp;lt; 50 K. Indeed, the extent of the profile is tightly constrained to K, with the contours matching the overall shape of the profile with altitude. As expected, the constraint becomes tighter around the photosphere ( bar), where the information content is greatest, and expands at altitudes away from those probed in transmission. This demonstrates that the terminator P-T profile shape can be correctly inferred from high-precision transmission spectra.  Figure   demonstrates that POSEIDON correctly retrieves all the parameters used to generate our simulated dataset to . The most tightly constrained parameters are the abundances of and , which are on the order of 0.2 dex. Where absorption signatures of a molecular species are not deemed necessary to explain the data, such as with the low and abundances, the posterior retains the flat shape of the prior below an established upper bound. Though the mode of the cloud deck pressure is coincident with the true value, and the terminator cloud fraction is sharply localised, the haze properties remain relatively unconstrained at the noise level of the optical data. This is unsurprising, as light transmitting through the relatively small fraction of the model atmosphere above the 0.1 mbar cloud deck will be insensitive to the haze. Indeed, the small tails in the chemical abundances to higher values can be seen as stemming from a weak correlation with the possibility of strong () hazes. For data where the scattering slope can be readily resolved, we do not see this tail.">
    <outline text="Breaking Cloud-Composition Degeneracies" _note="Chemical inferences are relatively independent of the values of the cloud parameters. This can be seen in Figure   by the roughly horizontal correlations between the detected chemical abundances and cloud properties. This is enabled by the clear sector of the terminator, which allows POSEIDON to disentangle the reference pressure from that of the cloud deck and hence break the degeneracy between uniform clouds and chemistry. To reiterate: NON-UNIFORM TERMINATOR CLOUD COVERAGE ENABLES PRECISE DETERMINATION OF CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES FROM TRANSMISSION SPECTRA.  Having verified POSEIDON’s ability to correctly retrieve atmospheric properties from high-precision transmission spectra, we now turn our attention towards the observed transmission spectrum of HD 209458b.">

<outline text="Results: Application to HD 209458b" _note="We here report the first application of POSEIDON to an exoplanet transmission spectrum. Specifically, we consider the visible &amp; near-infrared spectrum of HD 209458b presented in , as this is the highest quality transmission spectrum presently available. Our retrieval, which includes observations over the range taken by the HST STIS and WFC3 instruments, is the most extensive to date, involving the computation of an unprecedented spectra.  We ran a comprehensive suite of retrievals spanning the model space of cloudy atmospheres. Four different cloud/haze prescriptions were considered: partial cloud coverage (both with and without hazes), uniform clouds and cloud-free atmospheres. Within each cloud prescription we performed nested model comparisons, whereby multiple retrievals are performed with chemical species selectively removed to evaluate their detection significances. This amounts to 8 independent retrievals, with 5 model computations each, for each cloud prescription, i.e. model computations in total. We finally report constraints on the terminator chemical abundances and temperature profile for the cloud model most preferred by the data. We additionally illuminate how the assumed cloud model influences the inferred chemical abundances.">

An detection () indicates the degree of preference for the reference model over the alternative model.    We detect the presence of partial cloud coverage across the terminator of HD 209458b. Table   summarises the results of our Bayesian model comparison, which indicates a preference for the patchy cloud model over the uniform cloud model. The cloud-free model is ruled out to when compared to the patchy cloud model and to when compared to uniform clouds. These detection significances can be understood by examining the posterior of the patchy cloud retrieval (Figure  ), which indicates a cloud fraction of . Given that the cloud fraction is closer to 1 than 0, it is unsurprising that the Bayesian evidence of the uniform cloud model exceeds that of the cloud-free model. Even after marginalising over the other parameters, the posterior probability distribution of is inconsistent with values of 0 or 1 ( range: ); reinforcing the large penalty the Bayesian evidence suffers when forced to consider models fixed at these values. As one final assessment of the presence of partial clouds, we conducted an additional retrieval where the cloud fraction was held fixed at the best fit (min ) value from the patchy cloud retrieval (). This model, the ‘fixed fraction’ model in Table  , possess the largest value of the Bayesian evidence amongst our cloud models and hence reinforces our assertion that patchy clouds are favoured by the data.  The detection significance of patchy clouds is found to be somewhat sensitive to the lower limit of the temperature prior considered. Identical retrievals with a lower limit on of 400 K result in values of of 949.35 and 947.17 for uniform clouds and cloud-free atmospheres respectively. The corresponding detection significances for patchy clouds are 3.2 and 3.8 , respectively. This effect is caused by a tendency for both cloud-free and uniform cloud models to favour lower temperature solutions  We infer a high altitude ( mbar) cloud deck on the cloudy fraction of the terminator. Above this cloud deck, we report a moderate detection () of high-altitude hazes. The necessity of strongly enhanced Rayleigh scattering (-Rayleigh) is visibly apparent in Figure   from the steep increase in the transit depth towards shorter wavelengths. In addition to the high strength of the scattering coefficient, the generalised slope is remarkably negative, tending to prefer values towards the lower edge of the prior. The presence of such a strong scattering cross section at these altitudes suggests two immediate possibilities: i) incredibly light particles capable of being lofted to these altitudes by vertical mixing; ii) continuous replenishment of the species at altitude (e.g. by photochemical reactions).  In what follows, we select the ‘fixed fraction’ cloud model, unless otherwise stated. This is the model that maximises the Bayesian evidence, and thus holds the greatest sway in light of the data. We display the full posterior of this model in Figure  . Note in particular that the values of the cloud parameters (and their associated errors) in this model remain consistent to within of the values shown in Figure  . This indicates that the uncertainty induced by allowing the cloud fraction to vary as a free parameter does not overly effect the inferences of the remaining cloud parameters compared to the case when it is fixed at the best fit value. In order to illustrate the importance of selecting the cloud model that is supported by the data, in the next section we will demonstrate how the inferred values and constraints on the retrieved chemical abundances crucially depend on the assumed cloud model.">

The abundances we report are amongst the most precise ever obtained from an exoplanet transmission spectrum ( dex for ). This is despite our marginalisation over two-dimensional terminator cloud coverage, due to POSEIDON’s ability to break the degeneracy between clouds and chemistry (Section  ). We explore how the assumed cloud distribution affects the inferred abundances in section  .  The terminator of HD 209458b is inconsistent with a solar abundance. This is established at confidence for both partial cloud and cloud-free models and at confidence for uniform clouds. The retrieved value, , is remarkably consistent with the values reported by both and ( to ). This is unsurprising, as the observed spectrum (Figure  ) shows the amplitude of the HO absorption feature at is only 2 scale-heights – whereas a solar composition atmosphere at a similar temperature and cloud coverage fraction would give 5 scale heights (Figure  ).  We demonstrate that the abundance can be reasonably well-constrained ( dex), despite the ppm errors in the optical STIS data. Whilst this serves as an important demonstration of principle, we caution against reading too much into the retrieved values. This is due to the simplicity of our treatment of the alkali cross sections in the present work (see section  ). We will address precise alkali abundance constraints in future work.  The abundances of both and show a sharp peak at with a tail towards lower abundances. The abundance of ammonia is the best constrained at ( ppm). The tails stem from the fact that either of these nitrogen-bearing species can explain the observed absorption features - if one has high abundance, the other will have low abundance and vice versa. Ultimately it is this long tail that prevents a unique determination of the species causing the absorption. It can be seen from the lower probability density of the tail in Figure   (and the higher Bayes factor in Table  ) that the presence of is marginally preferred over when considering partial cloud coverage. This symmetry is broken when considering cloud-free or uniformly cloudy models, both of which feature well-constrained and a flat posterior for - explaining the detections observed in these models. Given the combination of these high detection significances and the coincident peak of its abundance distribution between the cloud-free and the partial cloud models, we strongly suspect that it is this species, not , that is the source of the detected nitrogen chemistry.">

In Figure   we show the effect on our best-fit spectrum (red) of removing the and . Given that is the dominant nitrogen-bearing molecule for this spectrum, this amounts to an assessment of the impact of ammonia on near-infrared transmission spectra.  The primary impact of absorption in the WFC3 bandpass is to raise the transit depth of HD 209458b by compared to what would be expected from pure absorption (blue) over the spectral range . A secondary feature of magnitude is seen between . These absorption features are readily identified by an examination of the cross section (Figure  ), which is seen to dominate that of over these two regions. The necessity of additional absorption is evident from the data itself, as there are 4 data points elevated by and one point elevated by above the model without nitrogen chemistry.  We now offer suggestions on how to distinguish between and in transmission spectra when nitrogen chemistry is detected. The difficulty inherent in this task is demonstrated in Figure  , where the black curve shows the effect of interchanging the abundances of and , such that becomes the dominant nitrogen-bearing molecule. causes an increase in the transit depth that is almost identical to that of from (Figure  ) , though it generally matches pure absorption outside this range. The degeneracy with may be lifted by high resolution observations in three regions of the WFC3 bandpass: i) ; ii) ; iii) . Given that the difference between and dominated spectra are of the order of the error bars (35ppm), this is pushing the frontier of current observational capabilities.  There is, however, another potential avenue that may enable the unique detection of / with WFC3 observations.

    <outline text="The Influence of Clouds on Chemical Abundances" _note="We now proceed to quantify the extent to which the cloud model assumed by a retrieval can influence the inferred chemical abundances. We have already identified an innate challenge in distinguishing between and in partially cloudy transmission spectra. We further saw in section   and Figure   that the detection significances and abundance constraints depend crucially on the cloud model employed by retrievals.  In general, our cloud-free abundances are artificially well constrained at lower values than those inferred by the preferred partial cloud model (though they remain consistent within ). However, this suggests that planets with genuinely low cloud coverage may permit strong detections with precise abundance constraints. This is especially evident in the case of nitrogen chemistry, where our cloud-free model clearly identifies the presence of at and constrains its abundance to . We hence suggest that, even given current observational errors, precise abundance determinations of nitrogen-bearing molecules may be obtained on planets with low overall terminator cloud coverage.  In contrast, the uniform cloud model tends to overestimate chemical abundances. This is strikingly apparent in the case of , which favours unphysical values towards the upper limit of the prior (). The biasing of abundances to erroneously high values under the assumption of uniform clouds is a consequence of a fundamental degeneracy between clouds, hazes, the reference pressure and the chemical abundances. For uniform terminator cloud coverage, the cloud deck pressure, and the pressure at the radius of the planet, , are equal, existing on a line in parameter space without a unique solution. Defining at a radii different to merely offsets the line of degeneracy. This family of solutions determines the baseline of the spectrum (Figure  , black dotted line). When and are lowered along this solution line, both the amplitude of spectral features and the Rayleigh-enhancement factor can rise to produce an identical spectrum. We have verified that this biasing to higher abundances is an artefact of the uniform cloud model itself by running simulated retrievals with solar abundances and confirming that the behaviour seen in Figure   can be reproduced for synthetic data. We thus caution against the blind application of uniform cloud models; indeed, our results suggest that cloud-free models are a better option if one solely wishes to estimate the chemical abundances of a transiting exoplanet to within  We have shown that partial cloud coverage breaks the degeneracy between clouds and chemistry imposed artificially by the assumption of uniform clouds (section  ). Alternatively, this degeneracy may be broken by assuming a priori knowledge of the scattering slope in the optical or of the molecular/condensate chemistry . The attraction of partial clouds is that we do not have to make such assumptions, allowing us to directly retrieve cloud, haze, chemical and temperature properties of the atmosphere simultaneously. Though we have shown that partial clouds enable precise determination of the and abundances, and are preferred by the Bayesian evidence at high significance, they complicate the interpretation of nitrogen chemistry as they tend to render the slopes of molecular features more shallow (Figure  , bottom right). This decreases the magnitude of the transit depth ‘gap’ induced by nitrogen chemistry over the range (Figure  ) by broadening the width of the pure absorption feature.  Given these chemical and cloud inferences, we now proceed to present our retrieved P-T profile of the terminator of HD 209458b. The combination of all three of these properties in required to build a coherent picture of the conditions on the terminator.">

  <outline text="Temperature Structure" _note="The temperature structure on the terminator of HD 209458b is not isothermal. If the data supported an isothermal profile, we would expect to see tending towards larger values, which we do not observe (see Figure  ). Whilst unsurprising from physical arguments and Global Circulation Model (GCM) simulations, this point merits emphasis. It is often assumed in transmission retrieval that with currently available data: i) it is not possible to retrieve the shape of the terminator P-T profile; ii) an isothermal profile does not overly affect the inferred abundances. Here we demonstrate the invalidity of the first assumption for high-precision data, which was also examined by , and for a critical examination of the second we refer the reader to .  Figure   shows our retrieved P-T profile. We highlight in red the near-infrared photosphere ( at ), as this is the region predominately probed in transmission. Notably, the temperature is not constant across the photosphere, changing by K. By assuming an isothermal profile, this behaviour, and its effect on molecular cross sections, will not be captured. As expected intuitively, a tight constraint on the temperature is obtained at these altitudes (K). The confidence regions naturally expand away from the regions directly probed by the observations, particularly at pressures mbar where we would usually expect the atmosphere to be opaque in slant geometry due to collisionally-induced opacity alone. Our retrieved photospheric temperature is some 200 K colder than the planetary equilibrium temperature ( K). This is unsurprising, given that transmission spectra probe high altitudes in the cooler terminator region. Again, we emphasise that such inferences are made possible by the high-precision transmission spectrum.  This profile represents the average terminator P-T profile. Strictly speaking, we expect this to be composed of two underlying profiles: a cooler profile in the cloudy terminator region and a warmer profile in the clear region – as condensates tend to form in cooler regions, where the P-T profile may intersect additional condensation curves than in the warmer region. This averaging also explains the relatively high-altitude photosphere, as the opaque cloud deck we infer at mbar in the cloudy region combines with the cloud-free region to determine the surface.">

<outline text="Summary And Discussion" _note="In this work, we have established a framework for retrieving properties of transiting exoplanet atmospheres with inhomogeneous clouds. As an initial demonstration, we applied our new atmospheric retrieval algorithm POSEIDON to the visible and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. Our major findings are as follows:  We have found a potential avenue to break degeneracies between clouds and chemistry. Such degeneracies are artificially imposed by assuming one-dimensional cloud coverage and can be lifted by considering two-dimensional inhomogeneous cloud distributions. This enabled us to demonstrate precise determinations of the abundances of the prominent chemical species in a given spectral bandpass.  We report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry in an exoplanet atmosphere – established at confidence. Both cloud-free and uniform cloud models identify NH as the probable cause of nitrogen-induced absorption observed over the range . The ammonia abundance is constrained to 0.01-2.7 ppm.  The HO abundance on the terminator of HD 209458b is sub-solar (5-15 ppm). This is established by a fully Bayesian exploration of transmission spectra, including two-dimensional cloud/haze distributions.  Partially cloudy models are favoured by a Bayesian model comparison over both uniformly cloudy () and cloud-free () models. The terminator cloud fraction is constrained to per cent.  Scattering due to high-altitude ( mbar) hazes is detected at .  The terminator temperature structure of a transiting exoplanet can be constrained using high-precision HST transmission spectra. The temperature in the line of sight near-infrared photosphere is constrained to K.  We have demonstrated that a wealth of information may be extracted from currently available high-precision HST transmission spectra. Our most interesting result is that non-uniform terminator properties may provide an avenue to extract ADDITIONAL information from exoplanet transmission spectra. Indeed, it appears that the consideration of inhomogeneous cloud coverage may have represented ‘missing physics’ that enabled us to break degeneracies in an otherwise underspecified problem. Exoplanet atmospheres are inherently multi-dimensional, and to treat them as one-dimensional will at best miss key insights and at worse incur unnecessary degeneracies.">
  <outline text="Disequilibrium Nitrogen Chemistry" _note="Given what is known from solar system and brown dwarf studies, our detection of nitrogen chemistry in an exoplanet atmosphere should come as no surprise. In particular, ammonia is present both on Jupiter – in the form of high altitude clouds – and in brown dwarf atmospheres . Recently, demonstrated that NH can be detected on brown dwarfs using low-resolution near-infrared data, though they noted a lack of obvious spectral features leading to their detection. We demonstrated in Figures   and   that the absorption features contributing to our NH detection in the near-infrared are located over the ranges and . Additionally, the fact that reported sharp NH abundance constraints in a population of three T-type brown dwarfs using WFC3 data alone further supports our detection. We also note that the nitrogen-bearing molecule HCN has been suggested, at low statistical significance, as a potential component in the atmosphere of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e . However, as we have noted in section   our detection significance of nitrogen chemistry varies dependant on the cloud model employed – with the lowest confidence being that for the partial cloud model at . This sensitivity raises the possibility that additional physical mechanisms not considered in our models could produce a similar effect to that which we attribute to nitrogen chemistry. To adequately address this will require a concerted effort with both the development of increasingly sophisticated retrieval forward models alongside additional observations with sufficiently high precision to resolve the differences between models with and without nitrogen chemistry.  Inferring nitrogen chemistry and resulting abundance constraints heralds the opening of a new window into exoplanetary composition and atmospheric dynamics. The ammonia abundance we infer (1 ppm) using our most preferred model represents a 100 enhancement over the value expected of an atmosphere in thermochemical equilibrium with solar nitrogen abundance at our constrained temperature in the photosphere . This suggests non-equilibrium processes may prove necessary in order to transport ammonia from regions where such high abundances can naturally form. One such avenue is transport-induced quenching, whereby regions where the characteristic dynamical timescale () is less than the chemical reaction timescale () reflect the abundance from the ‘quench’ level where . For HD 209458b, for both horizontal and vertical advection , whereas in the terminator photosphere ( K) for NH N conversion . If horizontal quenching dominates, the NH abundance would be expected to follow the chemical equilibrium value characteristic of the dayside, where is shorter . If, however, vertical quenching dominates, the NH abundance in the observable photosphere will reflect that of the chemical equilibrium abundance at the altitude where , which occurs around pressures bar . Our abundance estimate of 1 ppm is remarkably consistent with that predicted at the terminator of HD 209458b by vertical quenching models using nominal temperature and atmospheric mixing profiles from GCMs and assuming a solar abundance of nitrogen. A wider range of parameters (e.g. mixing strengths, N abundance, etc.) beyond those specifically assumed in the forward models of could also potentially explain the same. This suggests that NH abundance constraints across a wide variety of exoplanets could provide a powerful diagnostic of the frequency and strength of non-equilibrium transport in a general context.">

  <outline text="Implications for Formation Conditions" _note="Recent years have seen increased interest in utilising elemental ratios as formation diagnostics. In particular, the C/O ratio is often invoked in attempts to constrain planetary formation and migration pathways relative to the snowlines of major condensates . Nitrogen chemistry offers complimentary diagnostics, as enhanced N/H ratios are anticipated for planets forming further out in protoplanetary disks . Indeed, suggested that the N/O ratio for planets forming in outer disks could be significantly enhanced relative to the stellar value and to the C/O ratio.  Our present constraints on HO and NH suggest a scenario where the planet formed far out in the disk and migrated to its present location by dynamical scattering. The sub-solar HO mixing ratio we find, despite the consideration of clouds/hazes, is inconsistent with an atmospheric composition of solar elemental abundances. Either a significantly sub-solar overall metallicity or super-solar C/O ratio are required to explain such low abundances . On the other hand, as discussed above, the observed NH abundance is consistent with non-equilibrium chemistry along with a nearly solar N abundance . Therefore, a consistent possible explanation for both the low HO and high NH abundance we observe is the presence of a super-solar C/O as well as a super-solar N/O ratio; the metallicity can be solar in all elements except O. This composition can be achieved if the planet formed beyond the CO or CO snowlines, accretes mostly gas and migrated to its current orbit by disk-free mechanisms or formed via pebble accretion . This is further supported by the fact that the host star HD 209458 is super-solar in metallicity, including O, which means that it would be infeasible to obtain such a low oxygen abundance in the planet if it migrated through the disk and accreted planetesimals .">

  <outline text="Solar vs. Sub-solar HO Estimates" _note="Our robust demonstration that the terminator of HD 209458b is depleted in HO relative to solar values runs contrary to the claim asserted by . By not performing a retrieval, explicitly imposing thermochemical equilibrium, assuming isothermal P-T profiles and considering only global clouds/hazes their models induce sufficient a priori biases to render their conclusions unreliable. Indeed, the inadequacy of this forward model approach has already been shown by , who performed a retrieval on the same dataset and found a sub-solar HO abundance ( solar) in excellent agreement with ours and that of . Though our HO abundances agree, the retrievals of are somewhat limited by the usage of an optimal estimation algorithm, which explored only a limited volume of parameter space (3,600 models vs. our ) on a pre-defined grid of temperature profiles and cloud properties. Furthermore, the lack of marginalisation over parameters or Bayesian evidence computation afforded by such an algorithm renders it impractical for parameter estimation or Bayesian model comparison, such as we have conducted here.  More sophisticated retrievals have also relied on making a priori model assumptions to break degeneracies between clouds and composition from transmission spectra. , who also used a nested sampling algorithm like ours, claims a solar HO abundance on the terminator of HD 209458b. However, their approach explicitly imposed a vast array of a priori physics: P-T profiles are not retrieved (radiative-convective equilibrium is assumed), C-N-O chemical pathways are enforced and clouds, assumed to be composed of , and , are constructed using a model inspired by that of and are uniform across the terminator. More recently, attempted retrieval of the day-side atmospheric properties of HD 209458b using thermal emission spectra. They found a rather broad range in HO abundance of 0.06-10 solar, i.e. including substantially sub-solar as well as super-solar values, at 1- confidence, on the day-side. However, as they point out, the inferences are hampered by an anomalously high CO abundance which is strongly correlated with the HO abundance. This is a well recognised problem in thermal emission retrievals which future work needs to investigate.  More generally, the imposition of a priori assumptions has been used in retrievals of transmission spectra of several exoplanets where chemical and/or radiative equilibrium is enforced to derive elemental O and C abundances . These approaches, more akin to forward models, undermine the ability of a retrieval to accomplish its fundamental goal: to infer the properties of an atmosphere with an absolute MINIMAL set of assumptions. Succinctly put: we have shown that, in addition to clouds and hazes, a sub-solar abundance at the terminator is essential to explain the low-amplitude spectral features of HD 209458b.">

  <outline text="Cloud Properties" _note="Our inference of a partially cloudy atmosphere along HD 209458b’s terminator compliments observations of inhomogeneous clouds in both the solar system and brown dwarfs. On Earth and Jupiter, a banded cloud structure arises from atmospheric convection cells transporting gas parcels vertically, where clouds form upon crossing the relevant condensation curve, with the dry air carried to a different latitude where the formation of clouds is suppressed . A similar mechanism has been postulated to induce latitudinally inhomogeneous clouds in brown dwarfs , with observational evidence also recently emerging .  Inhomogeneous cloud distributions have similarly been predicted to be common across the terminator region of hot Jupiters . The physical mechanism here is the day-night temperature contrast on tidally locked planets driving a super-rotating equatorial jet, in turn raising the temperature of the eastern terminator by hundreds of K above that of the cooler western terminator , where clouds are then more likely to form. Interestingly, we infer the properties of our cloudy region to consist of extremely high-altitude ( mbar) clouds with enhanced Rayleigh scattering above the deck. The temperatures at these altitudes are less than those at which photochemical hazes are expected to form , so it is possible that the cloud deck we infer may be photochemical in origin. This possibility will require exploration by detailed photochemical models to explore its plausibility.  The clear terminator asymmetry in cloud properties on HD 209458b naturally raises the possibility of asymmetry in other observable properties. For example, predicted that the eastern limb of HD 209458b should be warmer than the western limb by around 200 K and that NH could be enhanced by an order of magnitude on the cooler western limb. The retrievals presented here do not consider such additional effects, with our present ability to disentangle the influence of clouds and chemistry contingent on both a sufficiently long spectral baseline (i.e. optical + near-infrared data) and the planet itself possessing a partially cloudy nature. Ultimately, the constraints derived by a retrieval algorithm are specific to the framework of the assumed models, and it remains to be investigated if differences in limb P-T profiles and chemical abundances can be extracted using current or near-future transmission spectra.  Though future facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will undoubtedly revolutionise our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, so much can still be accomplished with currently available high-precision HST spectra. Our results suggest that the key to obtaining precise chemical abundances from cloudy transmission spectra is rooted in the partially cloudy nature of their terminator; it is the stellar light transiting through the cloud-free region that facilitates breaking many apparent degeneracies between clouds and chemistry. Therefore clouds need not be an insurmountable issue for sufficiently high-precision HST transmission spectra. Now, 8 years after the advent of atmospheric retrieval, the time has come to move beyond one-dimensional models. As we enter the golden age of retrieval, the future is inherently two-dimensional.">

<outline text="Derivation of The Two-Dimensional Transit Depth" _note="For completeness, here we present a concise derivation of the wavelength-dependant transit depth (Equation  ) for a two-dimensional atmosphere. The transit depth is defined as the fractional stellar flux difference induced as a planet transits its parent star where is the spectral flux observed outside of the transit and is the spectral flux observed during the transit. The fluxes are in turn defined as integrals of the intensity over solid angle, projected in the observer’s line of sight where is a unit vector in the direction of propagation of a beam, is the unit vector in the direction of the observer and is the solid angle subtended at the observer.  The flux outside of transit is solely due to the star. From the geometry in Figure  , we see that and . Thus we have where is the intensity at the stellar photosphere. In carrying out the radial integral in the second equality, we have implicitly assumed the stellar intensity is uniform as a function of the impact parameter. This is valid as non-uniform stellar disks, due to limb darkening, are accounted for during data reduction.  The flux during the transit is comprised of three components: flux from the planet itself, stellar flux transmitting through the planetary atmosphere and stellar flux from the disk of the host star surrounding the planet The first integral will evaluate to zero, as the thermal intensity from the planetary nightside, , is negligible compared to the stellar flux. is the attenuated stellar intensity at impact parameter and azimuthal angle following passage through a region of the atmosphere with optical depth . Note that the lower impact parameter limit of the second integral is set to zero to account for the possibility of rays of a given wavelength passing through the planet below . Where this may occur is dictated by the local conditions (particularly clouds) at a given azimuthal angle. Regions with low opacity will posses a much deeper opaque radius. Accounting for this requires full evaluation over all impact parameters, without assuming a common lower value for all wavelengths. The third integral is readily evaluated: To evaluate the second integral, we require an expression for . We make use of the fact that, in the case of transmission of stellar radiation, there will be no emission or scattering into the beam. This renders the solutions of the equation of radiative transfer into simple exponential attenuation, given by Beer’s law: . Substituting this into the second integral in   yields Substituting this and Equation   into Equation   gives Noting that and splitting the integral in Equation   gives  Finally, the flux during and outside transit can be substituted into Equation   to determine the transit depth where is the ‘one-dimensional’ transmission spectrum that would result from assuming an axially symmetric atmosphere with the same properties as the two-dimensional atmosphere possesses at polar angle As an additional geometric interpretation, we note that this expression for the one-dimensional transit depth is equivalent to taking a perfectly opaque disk of radius and subtracting the transmitted stellar light. The transmission is simply the integral of the relative area of successive annuli (compared to that of the disk), each weighted by .   ">
