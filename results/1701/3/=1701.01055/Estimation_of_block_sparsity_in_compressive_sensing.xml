    <title>Estimation of block sparsity in\
compressive sensing</title>
    <abstract>Explicitly using the block structure of the unknown signal can achieve
better recovery performance in compressive censing. An unknown signal
with block structure can be accurately recovered from underdetermined
linear measurements provided that it is sufficiently block sparse.
However, in practice, the block sparsity level is typically unknown. In
this paper, we consider a soft measure of block sparsity, and propose a
procedure to estimate it by using multivariate isotropic symmetric
-stable random projections without sparsity or block sparsity
assumptions. The limiting distribution of the estimator is given. Some
simulations are conducted to illustrate our theoretical results. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="its introduction a few years ago , Compressive Sensing (CS) has attracted considerable interests (see the monographs for a comprehensive view). Formally, one considers the standard CS model, where is the measurements, is the measurement matrix, is the unknown signal, is the measurement error, and . The goal of CS is to recover the unknown signal by using only the underdetermined measurements and the matrix . Under the assumption of sparsity of the signal, that is has only a few nonzero entries, and the measurement matrix is properly chosen, can be recovered from by certain algorithms, such as the Basis Pursuit (BP), or -minimization approach, the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) , Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) and the Iterative Harding Thresholding algorithm . Specifically, when the sparsity level of the signal is , if with some universal constant , and is subgaussian random matrix, then accurate or robust recovery can be guaranteed with high probability.  The sparsity level parameter plays a fundamental role in CS, as the number of measurements, the properties of measurement matrix , and even some recovery algorithms all involve it. However, the sparsity level of the signal is usually unknown in practice. To fill the gap between theory and practice, very recently proposed a numerically stable measure of sparsity with , which is in ratios of norms. By random linear projections using i.i.d univariate symmetric -stable random variables, the author constructed the estimation equation for with by adopting the characteristic function method and obtained the asymptotic normality of the estimator.  As a natural extension of the sparsity with nonzero entries arbitrarily spread throughout the signal, we can consider the sparse signals exhibit additional structure in the form of the nonzero entries occurring in clusters. Such signals are referred to as block sparse . Block sparse model appears in many practical scenarios, such as when dealing with multi-band signals , in measurements of gene expression levels , and in colour imaging . Moreover, block sparse model can be used to treat the problems of multiple measurement vector (MMV) and sampling signals that lie in a union of subspaces .  To make explicit use of the block structure to achieve better sparse recovery performance, the corresponding extended versions of sparse representation algorithms have been developed, such as mixed -norm recovery algorithm , group lasso or adaptive group lasso , iterative reweighted recovery algorithms , block version of OMP algorithm and the extensions of the CoSaMP algorithm and of the Iterative Hard Thresholding to the model-based setting , which includes block sparse model as a special case. It was shown in that if the measurement matrix has small block-restricted isometry constants which generalizes the conventional RIP notion, then the mixed -norm recovery algorithm is guaranteed to recover any block sparse signal, irrespectively of the locations of the nonzero blocks. Furthermore, recovery will be robust in the presence of noise and modeling errors (i.e., when the vector is not exactly block sparse). showed that the block versions of CoSaMP and Iterative Hard Thresholding exhibit provable recovery guarantees and robustness properties. In addition, with the block-coherence of is small, the robust recovery of mixed -norm method, and the block version of the OMP algorithm are guaranteed in .  The block sparsity level plays the same central role in recovery for block sparse signals as the sparsity level in recovery for sparse signals. Namely, the required number of measurements, properties of the recovery measurement matrix (Block RIP), and some recovery algorithms for signals with block structure all depend on the block sparsity level. However, in reality, the block sparsity level of the signals are also unknown. To obtain its estimator is very important from both the theoretical and practical views.">

  <outline text="Definitions" _note="We firstly introduce some basic concepts for block sparsity and propose a new soft measure of block sparsity.  With , we define the -th block of a length- vector over . The -th block is of length , and the blocks are formed sequentially so that Without loss of generality, we assume that , then . A vector is called block -sparse over if is nonzero for at most indices . In other words, by denoting the mixed norm a block -sparse vector can be defined by .  Despite the important theoretical role of the parameter , it has a severe practical drawback of being not sensitive to small entries of . For instance, if has large blocks and small blocks, then as soon as they are nonzero. To overcome this drawback, it is desirable to replace the mixed norm with a soft version. Specifically, we generalize the sparsity measure based on entropy to the block sparsity measure. For any non-zero signal given in ( ), it induces a distribution on the set of block indices , assigning mass at index , where . Then the entropy based block sparsity goes to where is the Rényi entropy of order .

Another case is (Multivariate Spherical Symmetric Cauchy Distribution ), unlike Multivariate Independent Gaussian case, the components of Multivariate Spherical Symmetric Cauchy are uncorrelated, but dependent. The perspective and contour plots for the densities of these two cases are illustrated in Figure  .

The assumption of symmetry is only for convenience, it was explained how to drop it in Section III-B.e of . A minor technical condition we place on is that the roots of its characteristic function are isolated (i.e. no limit points). This condition is satisfied by many families of distributions, such as Gaussian, Student’s , Laplace, uniform, and stable laws. And we assume that the noise scale parameter and the distribution are treated as being known for simplicity.\ Since our work involves different choices of , we will write instead of . Then the link with the norm hinges on the following basic lemma.\ [**Lemma 3.**]{} Let be fixed, and suppose with i.i.d drawn from with and .

Hence, in the special case of random linear measurements without noise, estimating the norm reduces to estimating the scale parameter of a univariate stable distribution from an i.i.d sample.\ Next, we present the estimation procedure by using the characteristic function method . We use two separate sets of measurements to estimate and . The respective sample sizes of each measurements are denoted by and .

The asymptotic properties of the estimators were presented. A series of simulation experiments illustrated our theoretical results.  There are some interesting issues left for future research. Throughout the paper, we assume that the noise scale parameter and the characteristic function of noise are known. In practice, however, they are usually unknown and need to be estimated. Although considered the effects of adopting their estimators in estimation procedure, how to estimate these parameters based on our random linear projection measurements itself is still unknown. In addition, we have been considering the sparsity and block sparsity estimations for real-valued signals so far.
