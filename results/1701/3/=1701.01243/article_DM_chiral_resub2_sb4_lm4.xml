    <title>Chiral Spin Liquid on a Kagome Antiferromagnet Induced by
[Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya]{} Interaction</title>
    <abstract>The quantum spin liquid material herbertsmithite is described by an
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice with
non-negligible Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). A well
established phase transition to the long-range order occurs in this
model when the DMI strength increases, but the precise nature of a
small-DMI phase remains controversial. Here, we describe a new phase
obtained from Schwinger-boson mean-field theory that is stable at small
DMI, and which can explain the dispersionless spectrum seen in inelastic
neutron scattering experiment by Han [ET AL.]{} ([Nature (London)
[**492**]{}, 406 (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11659)). It is
a time-reversal symmetry breaking spin liquid, with the unique property
of a small and constant spin gap in an extended region of the Brillouin
zone. The phase diagram as a function of DMI and spin size is given, and
dynamical spin structure factors are presented. </abstract>
