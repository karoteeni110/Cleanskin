<outline text="Introduction" _note="The performance of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) often deteriorates after in-situ deployment of the network . Link quality degradation, due to, e.g., fading and interference, is one of the major reported causes behind such behavior, which may be significant enough to impact the link’s performance, e.g., the packet delivery ratio. Detecting such anomalous degradation in link quality is crucial for an operational WSN to decide possible remedy actions such as tuning stack parameters . In such way, the network can continuously maintain its performance and satisfy the user’s requirements.  In resource constrained WSNs, detecting anomalous link quality degradation requires [**lightweight**]{} solutions with low overheads in using memory, computation and communication resources. Resource-hungry centralized monitoring systems and/or machine learning-based detection techniques are hence hardly applicable to WSNs, due to large communication and/or computation overheads. In addition, a solution should be [**accurate**]{} with a low error rate (false positive/negative rate) and be [**robust**]{} with consistent performance under diverse link conditions and dynamic environment changes. However, in WSNs, due to the stochastic nature of link quality metrics, e.g., received signal strength indicator (RSSI) , it is challenging to distinguish between true link quality degradation and normal randomness. Data smoothing may only mitigate the problem. CDF-based and Chebyshev inequality-based statistical techniques are lightweight and seem to be effective in making the distinguishing. However, our investigation, as to be shown later in this paper, reveals that it is difficult to optimize them to achieve both high detection accuracy and robustness for links which may experience diverse link conditions and dynamic environment changes.  To meet these requirements, i.e., lightweight, accurate and robust, we have designed a system for detecting anomalous link quality degradation, called RADIUS. In addition to being lightweight, its design has also been aimed at minimizing the detection error (caused by normal randomness of RSSI) in discriminating good links from weak links and at being robust in maintaining the detection performance for different links and under dynamic environment changes. Central to the design is a threshold-based decision approach (for being lightweight) that has its foundation on the Bayes decision theory (for being accurate and robust).  To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has investigated the applicability of Bayesian thresholding in detecting anomalous link quality degradation in WSNs. A possible reason is perhaps due to the various challenges inherent in applying the approach. To address these challenges, various techniques have been developed to identify the number of RSSI samples needed to achieve a “good” approximation of the mean and the standard deviation, to update the mean and standard deviation estimates, and to choose and update a “proper” setting for the A PRIORI probability, where the mean, the standard deviation and the A PRIORI probability are the three fundamental variables used in the Bayes formula.  A prototype of the RADIUS system has been implemented and deployed in an indoor testbed. For proper configuration of the parameters involved in the various techniques in RADIUS, suggestions on their settings are given based on extensive experiments. In addition, we found that high detection accuracy can be achieved by RADIUS under diverse link conditions more robustly as compared to the CDF and Chebyshev thresholding techniques. Moreover, the overhead analysis and the detection results show that RADIUS not only has low overheads in memory, communication and computation, but also is accurate in detecting link quality anomalies for all links across the network, maintaining a stable error rate of 6.13% on average. These are an indication of RADIUS in fulfilling the requirements.  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section   discusses the related work. Section   presents the system design and motivates the adoption of Bayesian thresholding. Section   introduces the key techniques used in RADIUS. Section   analyzes the effect of the various involved parameters in these RADIUS techniques on the detection performance. Section   reports the details of our implementation, the corresponding system overheads and the overall performance evaluation in an operational system on an indoor testbed. Finally, Section   concludes the paper.">
