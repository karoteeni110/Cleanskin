    <title>RADIUS: A System for Detecting Anomalous Link Quality Degradation in
Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
    <abstract>To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is
crucial that the network is able to detect anomalies in communication
quality (e.g., RSSI), which may cause performance degradation, so that
the network can react accordingly. In this paper, we introduce RADIUS, a
lightweight system for the purpose. The design of RADIUS is aimed at
minimizing the detection error (caused by normal randomness of RSSI) in
discriminating good links from weak links and at reaching high detection
accuracy under diverse link conditions and dynamic environment changes.
Central to the design is a threshold-based decision approach that has
its foundation on the Bayes decision theory. In RADIUS, various
techniques are developed to address challenges inherent in applying this
approach. In addition, through extensive experiments, proper
configuration of the parameters involved in these techniques is
identified for an indoor environment. In a prototype implementation of
the RADIUS system deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that
RADIUS is accurate in detecting anomalous link quality degradation for
all links across the network, maintaining a stable error rate of 6.13%
on average. </abstract>
