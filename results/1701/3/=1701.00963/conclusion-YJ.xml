<outline text="Conclusion" _note="This paper presents RADIUS, a system for detecting anomalous link quality degradations in low-power radio links. The RADIUS system is light-weight, accurate and robust to a diversity of link conditions and dynamic environment changes. To achieve this, RADIUS (1) lays its foundation on a Bayesian thresholding scheme, integrated with dedicated techniques for (2) minimal training set size estimation, (3) sliding-window data smoothing, (4) distribution self-adaptation, and (5) feedback-based threshold parameter adaptation. The comparison with two popular statistical approaches shows that RADIUS does not need fine-tuning of its threshold parameter to achieve near-optimal accuracy across the network. The impact of the system parameters is also investigated in detail, identifying the best configuration for an indoor environment. Moreover, we have implemented the RADIUS system and evaluated its performance on an indoor WSN testbed, showing that it can adapt to dynamic environment changes and achieve accurate detection over the entire network with an average error rate of 6.13%.">
