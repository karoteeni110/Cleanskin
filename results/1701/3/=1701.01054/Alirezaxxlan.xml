<outline text="Introduction" _note="Fractional calculus became an important tool which was applied successfully in many branches of science and engineering etc . The models based on fractional derivatives are crucial for describing the processes with memory effect . Local fractional has been defined on the real-line . As it is well known the integer, fractional and complex order derivatives and integrals are defined on the real-line. Analysis on the fractal has been studied by many researchers . The fractals curves and the functions on fractal space are not differentiable in the sense of standard calculus. As a result, by this motivation recently in the seminal paper the -calculus is suggested as a framework on the fractal sets and fractal curves . The -calculus is generalized and applied in physics as a new and useful tool for modelling processes on the fractals. Newtonian mechanics and Schrdinger equation on the fractal sets and curves are given . The gauge integral is utilized to generalized the -calculus for the unbound and singular function . The fractal grating is modeled by -calculus and corresponding diffraction is presented . One of the important aspects of fractional calculus was transferred recently to the fractal derivatives. Namely, the concept of non-local fractal derivatives was introduced in . In this manuscript our main aim is to define the fractal non-local derivatives and study their properties.\ The plane of this work is as follows:\ In Section   we summarize the basic definitions and properties of the the local fractional derivatives. In Section   the scaling properties of local and non-local derivatives are derived. More, in Section   we develop the theory of fractal local and non-local Laplace transformations. In Section   the comparison of local and non-local linear fractal differential equations are presented. In Section   we indicate some illustrative applications. Section   contains our conclusion.">

<outline text="Application of non-local fractal differential equations [6-sec]" _note="In this section we give the applications and new models are given to the non-local fractal derivatives .\ **Fractal Abel’s tautochrone:** As a first example we generalized Abel’s problem which is the curve of quick descent on the fractal time-space. Using the conservation of energy in the fractal space the differential equation of the motion a particle is where is fractal arc length, and fractal space gravitational constant, and is the high particle from the reference of potential. As a result we have Let us consider so that we have Utilizing we arrive at It follows The solution of Eq.( ) is called the fractal cycloid.\ **Fractal models for the viscoelasticity:** We generalize the viscoelasticity models to the fractal mediums in the case of ideal solids and ideal liquids. Namely, the fractal ideal solids describe by which is called Hooke’s Law of fractal elasticity. Where is fractal stress, is fractal strain which occurs under the applied stress and is the elastic modulus of the fractal material.\ The fractal ideal fluid can model and describe by Newton’s Law of fractal viscosity as follows where is the viscosity of the fractal material. But in the nature we have real martials which have properties between the ideal solids and ideal liquids. It is clear that in the Hooke’s Law of fractal elasticity Eq. ( ) fractal stress is proportional to the -order derivative of the fractal strain and in the Newton’s Law of fractal viscosity the stress is proportional to the -order derivative of the fractal strain. Therefore, more general model is which is called fractal Blair’s model. Here, we suggest the fractional non-local order fractal derivative as an index of memory. Namely, if we choose in the process is nothing forgotten and the case of the process is memoryless. Hence if we choose it shows the processes with memory on the fractals.\ If we choose where is characteristic function of the triadic Cantor set. In Figure   we plot the .  Utilizing Eq.
