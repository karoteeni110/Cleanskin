    <title>Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and Primordial Gravity Waves</title>
    <abstract>We examine the effect of the stress tensor of a quantum matter field,
such as the electromagnetic field, on the spectrum of primordial gravity
waves expected in inflationary cosmology. We find that the net effect is
a small reduction in the power spectrum, especially at higher
frequencies, but which has a different form from that described by the
usual spectral index. Thus this effect has a characteristic signature,
and is in principle observable. The net effect is a sum of two
contributions, one of which is due to quantum fluctuations of the matter
field stress tensor. The other is a quantum correction to the graviton
field due to coupling to the expectation value of this stress tensor.
Both contributions are sensitive to initial conditions in the very early
universe, so this effect has the potential to act as a probe of these
initial conditions. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The possible roles of quantum stress tensor fluctuations of a conformal matter field in inflationary cosmology were explored in Refs. . The basic hypothesis is that vacuum fluctuations of the energy density, or other stress tensor components, during inflation can lead to additional density or tensor perturbations beyond those due to the nearly Gaussian fluctuations of the inflaton or graviton fields, which are the dominant source of perturbations in inflationary models. One of the usual features of inflationary models is the relative lack of dependence upon initial conditions. This arises because adequate inflationary expansion will redshift and dilute pre-existing matter, so a generic quantum state tends eventually to become indistinguishable from the Bunch-Davies vacuum of de Sitter spacetime. However, the effects of quantum stress tensor fluctuations exhibit a strong dependence upon the initial conditions, and tend to grow with increasing duration of the inflationary expansion. In particular, the contributions to the density perturbations  and the tensor perturbations  are proportional to the scale factor change between an initial time and the end of inflation. At first sight, this violates Weinberg’s theorem , which states that loop corrections can grow at most logarithmically in the scale factor during inflation. However, a more careful analysis shows that there is in fact no contradiction. One picks a perturbation with a given wavelength at the present time, and then traces it back to the initial time, when it becomes a perturbations with very short wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the scale factor change during inflation. However, the magnitude of stress tensor fluctuation effects increases as the relevant length scale decreases. The stress tensor fluctuation contribution can typically be written as a double integral over conformal time of the stress tensor correlation function. Thus, increasing the duration of inflation leads to increasing values of the integrals of the stress tensor correlation function, because shorter proper wavelength modes are giving the dominant contribution, not because anything is accumulating as inflation progresses. Another way of saying this, is that the the dominant contribution is always large, but is not growing in time. Thus, it is misleading to refer to these contributions as “secular terms&quot;.  The main purpose of the present paper is to perform a more careful analysis of the tensor perturbations due to stress tensor fluctuations which was begun in Ref. . The analysis in this reference was criticized by Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{} , who noted correctly that an important contribution was omitted. In addition to the passive fluctuations of the graviton field due to stress tensor fluctuations, there is also a correction to the active fluctuations of the graviton field which is of the same order. Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{} propose a method for calculating the combined effect of both contributions which leads to a result which does not depend upon the duration of inflation, and infer that the two contributions have cancelled one another. In the present paper, we propose a rather different approach in which each contribution is computed separately, with initial conditions imposed by a switching function. This function describes the switch-on of the coupling of the matter stress tensor with the graviton field. We do not find cancellation between the passive and active fluctuation effects, but rather a nonzero one loop correction to the graviton power spectrum.  The outline of the paper is as follows: Section   will discuss averaging of quantum fields with switching functions of time. Section   will review free gravitons in an expanding universe, and Sec.   will introduce some formalism for describing the effects of a quantum matter field. Section   will compute the correction to the graviton power spectrum coming from matter stress tensor fluctuations. These are the passive fluctuations of gravity driven by the fluctuating stress tensor. The part of the power spectrum coming from loop corrections to the graviton field, the modified active fluctuations, is treated in Sec.  . The combination of both effects is discussed in Sec.  , and shown in our approach to be nonzero, and dependent upon the details of the switching function. In general, it has the effect of slightly reducing the overall power spectrum. Some numerical estimates, and the possibility of observing this reduction will be discussed. Our results will be summarized and discussed in Sec.  .">

<outline text="Switching Functions in Quantum Field Theory" _note="In interacting quantum field theory calculations of scattering amplitudes, it is common to appeal to adiabatic switching of the coupling constants of the theory. This allows the theory to be non-interacting in the past and in the future, and allows a well defined -matrix to connect the asymptotic states. Here the term “adiabatic&quot; means that the scale of any time dependence in the coupling constants is long compared to any other time scales in the theory. The details of the time dependence usually need not be specified.  There is a different type of switching required in treatments of the fluctuations of quantum stress tensor operator. The fluctuations of a local field operator are not defined, as the moments of such an operator will diverge if they are not zero. However, the time average or spacetime average of a local stress tensor operator does have finite moments, and can have a meaningful probability distribution in a given quantum state, as discussed in Refs. . Here we briefly review the basic ideas, and describe the role which they will play in the present paper. Let be a stress tensor operator component, such as energy density, which has been renormalized to have finite expectation values. In Minkowski spacetime, this means a normal ordered operator. In curved spacetime, it means an operator which has been regulated and renormalized, as will be reviewed in Sec.  . Although the local operator may have finite expectation values in physically realizable states, its fluctuations are not well defined because its higher moments, for typically diverge. The physical implication of this divergence is that the fluctuations of a local operator, such as energy density at a single spacetime point are infinite and hence not meaningful. However, if we average over a finite time or spacetime interval, then the fluctuations do become well defined.  Let be the average of at a given spatial point with respect to a smooth () switching function , which satisfies for . Now the moments of become finite, and a meaningful probability distribution may be defined . The effect of the time averaging described by , is to suppress the contribution of high frequency modes to the moments. Averaging in space alone at a single time is not adequate to produce this suppression, but averaging in both space and time has qualitatively the same effect as does time averaging alone. One may view the averaging of a stress tensor operator as describing its measurement process in a given physical situation, where the details of the situation define the switching function. An example of this was discussed in Ref. , which treats the effects of vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations on quantum particles near a potential barrier. Here the duration of the switching is taken to be determined by the time which the particle spends in the vicinity of the barrier, and the form of the switching function to be defined by the shapes of both the barrier and the wavepacket of the particle. Similar ideas were applied in Ref.  to the fluctuations of the quantized electric field. Most of the above discussion of averaged stress tensor operators, which are quadratic in the quantum field operator, applies to linear quantum fields, such as the electric field. The primary difference is that the stress tensor probability distribution is sensitive to the functional form of the switching function, whereas the probability distribution for the electric field is always a Gaussian, and depends primarily upon the width of the switching interval. In Ref. , it was shown that if this switching time is taken to be the time which a charged particle spends in the vicinity of a potential barrier, then the resulting electric field fluctuations produce a change in the scattering amplitude which approximately agrees with that given by the one loop vertex correction to the scattering amplitude. This agreement supports the hypothesis that the details of a given physical situation can define the appropriate switching function.  In the present paper, we are concerned with the coupling of a quantized matter field stress tensor with gravity, specifically with the tensor perturbation of an expanding universe. This coupling is mediated by Newton’s constant, which will be assumed to be time-dependent in the early universe. This time-dependence produces both of the types of switching discussed above, the switching of the coupling constant of the theory, and time-averaging of the quantum stress tensor operator. The functional form of the switching and its physical origin are not specified, but assumed to arise from some processes in the early universe which are not yet understood. Several specific choices will be explored in Sec.  .">

  <outline text="Tensor metric perturbations in spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetimes" _note="We start with a brief review of the propagation of gravitational waves in a spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe, described by the background metric where is comoving time and is conformal time. Let the perturbed metric tensor be where the background metric, Eq. , is and is the perturbation. We may impose the transverse, trace-free (TT) gauge conditions which reduce the metric perturbations to two transverse physical degrees of freedom, corresponding to the polarizations of the gravitational wave. Here the semicolon denotes the covariant differentiation with respect to the background metric , and is the four-velocity of a comoving observer.  It was shown by Lifshitz  that in the absence of sources, the mixed tensor of the metric perturbation in this gauge satisfies the scalar wave equation in the spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe, where the scalar wave operator in the metric Eq.  takes the form with denoting the determinant of the background metric . This implies that gravitational waves behave like a pair of free minimally coupled massless scalar fields in the the spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe . In general. we may write the solution to Eq.  as a sum of plane wave modes, which are of the form where , is a wave vector, and labels the independent polarizations. The gauge conditions, Eq. , imply that the polarization tensor satisfies When the wavevector is in the -direction, the two independent polarization tensors have very simple forms: while other elements vanish. The temporal part of the mode function, , satisfies and hence depends upon the functional form of the scale factor and upon , but is independent of polarization and of the direction of .

The factor of in arises because the effective energy momentum tensor for gravitons is quadratic in and proportional to . (See the discussion in Sec.  .) In addition, we require that the zero point energy of a given graviton mode, which is an integral of the effective energy momentum tensor, have its usual form of one-half of the angular frequency of the mode, which is independent of .  The above mode expansion defines a vacuum state by , for all and . However, this vacuum state is not uniquely defined, as there are an infinite set of mode functions which satisfy both Eqs.  and . This is the usual ambiguity of defining particles in curved spacetime. We will not attempt to address this ambiguity for a general scale factor, but will focus on the special case of de Sitter spacetime.">

The set of coordinates covers one-half of global de Sitter spacetime, but this is more than enough for inflationary cosmology, where can be restricted to run over a finite range. With this choice of scale factor, the solutions of may be expressed in terms of Hankel functions as where the Wronskian condition implies Each allowed choice of and , which may be functions of , leads to a different definition of the graviton vacuum in de Sitter spacetime. The Bunch-Davies vacuum arises when and . For massive or nonminimally coupled scalar fields, the Bunch-Davies vacuum is also the de Sitter invariant vacuum state. It is an attractor state in the sense that inflation redshifts the particle content of other states, and causes them to approach the Bunch-Davies vacuum. However, the Bunch-Davies vacuum does not exist in a strict sense for massless, minimally coupled scalar field or for the graviton field. This is due to an infrared divergence in the two-point function. For free gravitons, this function is defined by and contains an integral of the form For the Bunch-Davies vacuum, , where Because as , the integral in Eq.  diverges logarithmically at its lower limit. One resolution of this problem is to modify the state slightly for very long wavelength modes . This may be done by allowing and to have the Bunch-Davies values for , but to vary for so as to avoid an infrared divergence in Eq. . So long as is below any graviton wavenumber with which we are concerned, this infrared finite state is indistinguishable for the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We will adopt his viewpoint here, and use Eq.  as the graviton mode function.  Now the mode expansion of the graviton field operator in de Sitter spacetime becomes">

<outline text="Effects of a Quantum Matter Field" _note="So far, we have been concerned with free gravitons propagating on a cosmological background spacetime. Now we wish to introduce quantized matter, which we take to be a conformal field, such as the electromagnetic field, with stress tensor operator . As is well-known, the expectation value of this operator in any quantum state is formally divergent, and needs to be regularized and renormalized by four counterterms in the Einstein equations . Two of these counterterms renormalize the cosmological constant and Newton’s constant, respectively. The second two counterterms are associated with two counterterms in the gravitational action which are quadratic in the curvature. These may be taken to be the square of the scalar curvature and of the Weyl tensor. After renormalization, may contain contributions from each of the tensors associated with each counterterm. In addition, it will contain a part with a nonzero trace, the conformal anomaly. If we omit the metric and Einstein tensors from cosmological constant and Newton’s constant renormalizations, the local geometric part of on a Robertson-Walker background may be written as Here the tensors , and are where is the Ricci tensor, is the scalar curvature, and the Weyl tensor is defined by for the metric tensor . The tensor will give the trace anomaly of the conformally invariant field in the conformally flat spacetime, and its coefficient takes different values for various conformally invariant fields. On the other hand, the coefficients , of the remaining two tensors are undetermined, and are associated with the two counterterms which are quadratic in the curvature. In addition to , there can be nonlocal contributions to , which will be discussed in more detail in Sec.  .  We will be concerned with the effects of the fluctuations of the matter stress tensor operator, , around its renormalized expectation value, . These stress tensor fluctuations will contribute to additional terms in the graviton field, which are higher order in than the free graviton field. However, we first discuss the various expansions which we need.">
  <outline text="Perturbative expansions" _note="The treatment of gravity waves on a fixed background necessarily involves an expansion of the metric and other tensors in powers of the metric perturbation. The perturbed metric tensor was defined in Eq. . We may expand the Einstein equations in powers of the perturbations, , using the corresponding expansion of the Einstein tensor: In the expansion of the Einstein equations, the lowest order is an equation for the background metric, the first order gives the equation for linear perturbations, Eq. , and the second order term describes the backreaction of gravity waves on the background, in the limit where the wavelength of the gravity waves is small compared to the local radii of curvature of the background geometry .  However, in addition to this expansion, we will need an expansion of the graviton field in powers of , which acts as the coupling constant for gravity. Write this expansion as This expansion begins at first order, as the free graviton field is already proportional to . Note that we use a notation in which the order in is denoted by a superscript on the left, as in Eq. , while the order in is denoted by a superscript on the right, as in Eq. .  We will now treat the Einstein equation as an operator relation involving both the graviton field operator, , and the matter stress tensor operator, . In the presence of a cosmological constant , the Einstein equation is Next we expand in both and to write  The first term in braces is zero-th order in the metric perturbation, and its vanishing is the equation for the background with the expectation value as its source, In de Sitter spacetime, and is hence a finite shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The second term in braces is first order both in and in , and its vanishing is the equation for the perturbation. Of the remaining terms, there are two which do not depend upon the conformal stress tensor. At the classical level, describes the backreaction of gravity waves on the background geometry, as noted above. At the quantum level, both and describe graviton loop effects, which we will ignore here.  The third and fourth terms in braces in Eq.  are of orders and , respectively, and may be separately set to zero, leading to and Equation  relates to the fluctuations of the matter stress tensor, and Eq.  relates to , the shift in the matter stress tensor operator due to a first order perturbation of the background.

<outline text="Gravity Waves from Stress Tensor Fluctuations" _note="In this section, we deal with the part of the graviton field, , and its contribution to the power spectrum. Equation  reveals that describes gravity waves radiated by the fluctuations of the conformal stress tensor. We impose the initial condition that if the right-hand side of Eq.  vanishes, which assumes no incoming radiation from other sources. Then the solution becomes where is the retarded Green’s function for the scalar wave operator, which satisfies The spatial Fourier transform of is (See, for example, Refs. .) in de Sitter spacetime.

  <outline text="Switching in Comoving Time" _note="It has been convenient in much of our analysis to use the conformal time as the time coordinate. However, the proper time for comoving observers is , the comoving time. During inflation, when , these time coordinates are related by Let inflation end at , or . If the universe expands by a factor of , then inflation begins at about , but at , a very large range of conformal time corresponds to a much smaller range of comoving time. In addition, much of the initial change in corresponds to a small fraction of the change in . Let be when roughly one-half of the total conformal time interval has elapsed, and let be the corresponding comoving time. The elapsed comoving time interval is . Thus, regardless of the size of , the first one-half of the total conformal time corresponds to less than one e-fold time in comoving time.  The implication is that apparently slow switching in conformal time is relatively rapid switching in comoving time. We can illustrate this more explicitly for the case of the exponential switching function, Eq. , which we can express as a functions of : The switch-on part of this function is plotted in Fig.   for the case , corresponding to or We can see that essentially all of the switch-on occurs in a comoving time interval of .  This is the comoving time required for about six e-folds. This seems to be a plausible switching interval. However, the functions discussed in Sec.   which describe more rapid switching, such as Eqs.  or with , can correspond to a comoving switching time . This seems unphysically short. Recall that these rapid switching cases are also those which give growing quadratically in . Thus the quadratic growth is probably an artifact of a too rapid switch-on. This leaves the linear growth behavior as the more reasonable case.">

They play a crucial role in the Hawking’s derivation of black hole particle creation , but it seems questionable that perturbation theory holds for such modes.

<outline text="Summary and Discussion" _note="In this paper, we have examined quantum corrections to the tensor power spectrum in inflationary models. The corrections with which we are concerned come from the coupling of gravitons to a conformal matter field, which we take to be the electromagnetic field. There are two distinct corrections to the power spectrum. One is , which arises from vacuum stress tensor fluctuations of the matter field. One can view this contribution as being the gravity waves radiated by the fluctuating stress tensor, or equivalently, the passive fluctuations of the gravitational field driven by the quantum stress tensor fluctuations. The other contribution is , which arises from a modification of the graviton field in de Sitter spacetime, produced by its coupling to the renormalized expectation value of the matter field. This can be viewed as a correction to the active fluctuations of the quantized tensor perturbations of de Sitter spacetime.  A key feature of our approach is the use of the switching function, . This function may be viewed as describing a switching of the coupling of gravity with the matter field through a time-dependent Newton’s constant. It may also be viewed as a form of time averaging of the quantum stress tensor operator, which is essential for a meaningful treatment of quantum stress tensor fluctuations. The viewpoint adopted in this paper is that this averaging is more than a formal device, and represents actual physical processes associated with the measurement of the stress tensor of a quantized field. In the case of cosmology, we postulate that it describes some physical effects in the early universe. These effects are presently not well understood and are associated with a choice of initial conditions.  We find that combined correction, , depends upon the choice of switching function. This seems to be required in our approach, because and scale with different powers of , as discussed at the end of Sec.  . For all of our explicit choices of , we find , so the effect is a slight reduction in the tensor power spectrum, compared to the result obtained from consideration of free gravitons in de Sitter spacetime. We also find that the magnitude of is proportional to the scale factor change during inflation. This is not due to growth as inflation progresses, but rather is due to decreasing proper wavelength of the perturbation at the initial time, as this time is made earlier. Recall that we consider a perturbation with given proper wavelength today, so its proper wavelength at the beginning of inflation depends upon the amount of subsequent expansion. Furthermore, the dominant contributions to and come from the beginning of inflation, or the initial switch-on interval, as evidenced by their growth with increasing , the effective switch-on time in conformal time. The essential physical reason for this behavior is that quantum stress tensor fluctuations are greater on smaller length scales. This introduces a breaking of de Sitter symmetry by the initial conditions. The situation described here is quite different from the usual behavior in inflationary models, where classical perturbations of a given proper wavelength at the beginning of inflation are more effectively redshifted away by an increasing duration of inflation.  Our conclusions clearly differ from those of Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{} , who find no significant dependence of upon the initial conditions. This seems to be due to physical inequivalence of our approaches. Fr[ö]{}b, [ET AL.]{}  use a rather formal prescription, which they call an “ prescription&quot; to select a de Sitter invariant state for the coupled conformal field - gravity system. Our view is that this prescription is not physically well motivated. In light of the discussion in the previous paragraph, we argue that one should expect to find the behavior found in this present paper, as well in Refs. , where the quantum corrections to the power spectrum depend upon initial conditions.  Our main result is a small decrease in the power spectrum of tensor perturbations which has the linear dependence upon given in Eq. . Note that this has a distinct functional form from the usual spectral tilt due to weak dependence of upon . The latter effect is due to the effective value of varying as different length scales leave the horizon during inflation, which will also be present in our model. This is usually modeled by a factor of the form , where is the tensor spectral index. The estimates given in Sec.   indicate that the quantum corrections to the power spectrum are small. However, if they can be observed, they could lead to insights about the initial conditions in the early universe.">
