    <title>Min-max formulas and other properties of certain classes of nonconvex
effective Hamiltonians</title>
    <abstract>This paper is the first attempt to systematically study properties of
the effective Hamiltonian arising in the periodic homogenization of some
coercive but nonconvex Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Firstly, we introduce
a new and robust decomposition method to obtain min-max formulas for a
class of nonconvex . Secondly, we analytically and numerically
investigate other related interesting phenomena, such as
“quasi-convexification" and breakdown of symmetry, of from other typical
nonconvex Hamiltonians. Finally, in the appendix, we show that our new
method and those a priori formulas from the periodic setting can be used
to obtain stochastic homogenization for same class of nonconvex
Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Some conjectures and problems are also
proposed. </abstract>

  <outline text="Overview" _note="Let us describe the periodic homogenization theory of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. For each , let be the viscosity solution to Here, the Hamiltonian is of separable form with , which is coercive (i.e., ), and , which is -periodic. The initial data , the set of bounded, uniformly continuous functions on .  It was proven by Lions, Papanicolaou and Varadhan that converges to locally uniformly on as , and solves the effective equation The effective Hamiltonian is determined in a nonlinear way by and through the cell problems as following. For each , it was shown in that there exists a unique constant such that the following cell problem has a continuous viscosity solution where is the -dimensional flat torus .  Although there is a vast literature on homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in different settings after , characterizing the shape of remains largely open even in basic situations. Let us summarize quickly what is known in the literature about . It is not hard to see that is coercive thanks to the coercivity of . If one assumes furthermore that is convex, then is also convex and the graph of can contain some flat parts (i.e., has interior points). See and the works of Concordel . Furthermore, in this convex setting, we have the following representation formula, thanks to the results of Contreras, Iturriaga, Paternain and Paternain , and Gomes , Note that the above representative formula still holds if is quasiconvex (level-set convex), in which case is also quasiconvex. More interestingly, in case , and , a deep result of Bangert says that the level curve for every must contain line segments (i.e., not strictly convex) unless is a constant function. Bangert’s result relies on detailed information about the structure of Aubry-Mather sets in two dimension (). See also Jing, Tran, Yu for discussion regarding locations of line segments of the level curves for Mañé type Hamiltonians.  The first numerical computation of effective Hamiltonians is due to Qian based on the so called [BIG-T METHOD]{}, that is, , where is the unique viscosity solution to For other numerical schemes, we refer to Gomes, Oberman , Falcone, Rorro , Achdou, Camilli, Capuzzo-Dolcetta , Oberman, Takei, Vladimirsky , Luo, Yu, Zhao and the references therein.  It is worth mentioning that cell problem and representation formula appear also in weak KAM theory (see E , Evans, Gomes , Fathi for the convex case, and Cagnetti, Gomes, Tran for the nonconvex case). In fact, a central goal of the weak KAM theory is to find information of underlying dynamical system encoded in the effective Hamiltonian.  In the case where is nonconvex, to identify the shape of is highly nontrivial even in the one dimensional space. This was settled only very recently by Armstrong, Tran, Yu , and Gao . One fundamental feature obtained is the “[QUASI-CONVEXIFICATION]{}&quot; phenomenon, that is, the effective Hamiltonian becomes quasiconvex (level-set convex) when the oscillation of is large enough. See Section   for more precise statements. In multi-dimensional spaces, Armstrong, Tran, Yu obtained a qualitative shape of for a representative case where . Other than , very little is known about finer properties of nonconvex in multi-dimensional spaces, partly due to the extreme complexity of dynamics associated with nonconvex Hamiltonians. Furthermore, as far as the authors know, there is no numerical study of in this case.  Let us also call attention to an extrinsic way to study via inverse problems. See Luo, Tran, Yu .">

  <outline text="Main results" _note="Reducing a complex quantity to relatively simpler objects is a very natural and common idea in mathematics. For a class of nonconvex Hamiltonians , we introduce a new decomposition method to obtain min-max type representation formulas for . These formulas consist of effective Hamiltonians of quasiconvex Hamiltonians which are presumably less challenging to analyze. The most general statement is given by inductive formulas (Theorem  ). Two specific (but important) cases of Theorem   are provided in Theorem   and Lemma  . One immediate corollary is the evenness of associated with a certain class of radially symmetric Hamiltonians, which is otherwise not obvious at all. Given the vast variety of nonconvex functions, our surgical approach is only a preliminary step toward understanding the shape of nonconvex . In Section 2.4, we present some natural obstacles to decomposing a nonconvex . In particular, there is a connection between “non-decomposability&quot; and loss of evenness.  As another interesting application, the method and the representation formulas are robust enough that we are also able to prove stochastic homogenization for the same class of nonconvex in the appendix. For instance, Theorem   includes the result in as a special case with a much shorter proof. The detailed discussion on this (including a brief overview of stochastic homogenization) is left to the appendix. We would like to point out that a priori identification of shape of is currently the only available way to tackle homogenization of nonconvex Hamilton-Jacobi equations in general stationary ergodic setting.  In Section 3, we provide various numerical computations of in multi-dimensional spaces for general radially symmetric Hamiltonians and a double-well type Hamiltonian. These provide insights on how the changes of potential energy affect the changes in shape of effective Hamiltonian . The important “quasi-convexification&quot; phenomenon is observed in multi-dimensional cases as well. Nevertheless, verifying it rigorously seems to be quite challenging. Interesting connections between decomposition, loss of evenness and quasi-convexification are demonstrated in Section 2.4 and Remark  . Several open problems are provided based on the numerical evidences we have in this section.">

A basic question is whether , as , converges to the solution to an effective deterministic equation ( ) almost surely as in the periodic setting.  The stochastic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations has received much attention in the last seventeen years. The first results were due to Rezakhanlou and Tarver and Souganidis , who independently proved convergence results for general convex, first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations in stationary ergodic setting. These results were extended to the viscous case with convex Hamiltonians by Kosygina, Rezakhanlou and Varadhan and, independently, by Lions and Souganidis . New proofs of these results based on the notion of intrinsic distance functions (maximal subsolutions) appeared later in Armstrong and Souganidis for the first-order case and in Armstrong and Tran for the viscous case. See Davini, Siconolfi , Armstrong, Souganidis for homogenization of quasiconvex, first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  One of the prominent open problems in the field is to prove/disprove homogenization in the genuinely nonconvex setting. In , Armstrong, Tran and Yu showed that, for , homogenizes in all space dimensions . In the next paper , Armstrong, Tran and Yu proved that, for , homogenizes for general coercive . Gao generalized the result in to the general non separable Hamiltonians in one space dimension. [A COMMON STRATEGY IN PAPERS IS TO IDENTIFY THE SHAPE OF IN THE PERIODIC SETTING FIRST AND THEN RECOVER IT IN THE STATIONARY ERGODIC SETTING. ]{} In particular, in contrast to previous works, our strategy does not depend on finding some master ergodic quantities suitable for subadditive ergodic theorems. Such kind of ergodic quantities may not exist at all for genuinely nonconvex .  Ziliotto gave a counterexample to homogenization of in case . See also the paper by Feldman and Souganidis . Basically, show that, if has a strict saddle point, then there exists a potential energy such that is not homogenizable.  Based on min-max formulas established in Section  , we prove that, for the Hamiltonians appear in Theorem  , Corollary  , Lemma  , and Theorem  , is always regularly homogenizable in all space dimensions . See the precise statements in Theorems  ,  , and Corollary   in Subsection  . Theorem   includes the result in as a special case. Also, the result of Corollary   implies that, in some specific cases, even if has strict saddle points, is still regularly homogenizable for every with large oscillation. See the comments after its statement and some comparison between this result and the counterexamples in .  The authors tend to believe that a prior identification of the shape of might be necessary in order to tackle homogenization in the general stationary ergodic setting. In certain special random environment like finite range dependence (i.i.d), the homogenization was established for a class of Hamiltonians in interesting works of Armstrong, Cardaliaguet , Feldman, Souganidis . Their proofs are based on completely different philosophy and, in particular, rely on specific properties of the random media.  In the viscous case (i.e., adding to equation ( )), the stochastic homogenization problem for nonconvex Hamiltonians is more formidable. For example, the homogenization has not even been proved or disproved for simple cases like in one dimension. Min-max formulas in the inviscid case are in general not available here due to the nonlocal effect (or regularity) from the viscous term. Nevertheless, see a preliminary result in one dimensional space by Davini and Kosygina .  The following definition was first introduced in .    We say that is regularly homogenizable if for every , there exists a unique constant such that, for every and for a.s. , Here, for , is the unique bounded viscosity solution to  According to Lemma 5.1 in , is equivalent to saying that for a.s. , Clearly, if is regularly homogenizable, then random homogenization holds, that is, solution of converges to , the solution to with defined by , as .">

  <outline text="Stochastic homogenization results" _note="The main claim is that is regularly homogenizable provided that is of a form in Theorem  , Corollary  , Lemma  , and Theorem  . The proof is basically a repetition of arguments in the proofs of the aforementioned results except that the cell problem in the periodic setting is replaced by the discount ergodic problem in the random environment. This is because of the fact that the cell problem in the random environment might not have sublinear solutions at all. Here are the precise statements of the results.    Assume that satisfies [(H1)–(H3)]{}. Assume further that . Then is regularly homogenizable and  As mentioned, this theorem includes the result in as a special case. An important corollary of this theorem is the following:    Let be a coercive Hamiltonian satisfying [(H1)–(H3)]{}, except that we do not require to be quasiconcave. Assume that , , and Then is regularly homogenizable and In particular, is quasiconvex in this situation.  It is worth emphasizing that we do not require any structure of in except that there. In particular, is allowed to have strict saddle points in . Therefore, Corollary   implies that, in some specific cases, even if has strict saddle points, is still regularly homogenizable provided that the oscillation of is large enough. In a way, this is a situation when the potential energy has much power to overcome the depths of all the wells created by the kinetic energy and it “irons out&quot; all the nonconvex pieces to make quasiconvex. This also confirms that the counterexamples in are only for the case that has small oscillation, in which case only sees the local structure of around its strict saddle points, but not its global structure.  Let us now state the most general result in this stochastic homogenization context that we have.    Assume that [(H6)]{} holds for some . Assume further that , . Then and are regularly homogenizable. Moreover, ( ) and ( ) hold in this random setting as well and In particular, and are both even. Here we use same notations as in Theorem  .  We also have the following conjecture which was proven to be true in one dimension .    Assume that is continuous and coercive. Set for . Then is regularly homogenizable.  We believe that Conjecture   should play a significant role in proving the above conjecture as in the one dimensional case. An initial step might be to obtain stochastic homogenization for the specific satisfying (H8). Below is closely related elementary question    Let be a periodic semi-concave (or semi-convex) function. Denote as the collection of all regular gradients, that is, Is a connected set?  The periodic assumption is essential. Otherwise, it is obviously false, e.g., for . When , the connectedness of follows easily from the periodicity and a simple mean value property (Lemma 2.6 in ).  As for the double-well type Hamiltonian in the two dimensional space, the following question is closely related to Question   and counterexamples in .    Assume that and for all , where . Does there exist such that, if then is regularly homogenizable?">

  <outline text="Proof of Theorem [thm:random]" _note="As a demonstration, we only provide the proof of Theorem   in details here. The extension to Theorem   is clear. Compared with the proof for the special case in , the following proof is much clearer and simpler.  We need the following comparison result.    Fix . Suppose that are respectively a viscosity subsolution and a viscosity supersolution to Assume further that there exists such that Then  Let Then, is still a viscosity supersolution to and furthermore, on . Hence, the comparison principle yields in .  Fix . For , let be the unique bounded continuous viscosity solution to In order to prove Theorem  , it is enough to show that Let us note first that, as is quasiconvex and is quasiconcave, and are regularly homogenizable (see ). It is clear that Once again, we divide our proof into few steps.  [**Step 1.**]{} Assume that . We proceed to show that Since , by the usual comparison principle, it is clear that It suffices to show that Let be the viscosity solution to Since is regularly homogenizable, we get that, for any , Fix . Pick such that holds. For each sufficiently small, there exists such that, for , Note that by inf-sup representation formula and the even property of , we also have that is also even, i.e., . In particular, Due to the quasiconvexity of , this implies that, for for some , In particular, , where .  Denote by . Then is a viscosity subsolution to Hence is a subsolution to . By Lemma  , we get Hence, holds. Compare this to Step 2 in the proof of Theorem   for similarity.  [**Step 2.**]{} Assume that . We proceed in the same way as in Step 1 (except that we use instead of because of the quasiconcavity of ) to get that Compare this to Step 3 in the proof of Theorem   for similarity.  [**Step 3.**]{} We now consider the case . Our goal is to show This step basically shares the same philosophy as Step 4 in the proof of Theorem  . Let us still present a proof here.  Thanks to the assumption that and the fact that , We therefore only need to show  For , are still regularly homogenizable for . Let be the effective Hamiltonian corresponding to . By repeating Steps 1 and 2 above, we get that: where is its corresponding effective Hamiltonian. Take so that for some . For , let be the viscosity solution to then by , Since , the usual comparison principle gives us that . Hence, holds true.  It remains to show that, if , then holds for some . As for , we only need to consider the case . There are two cases, either or . Again, it is enough to consider the case that . For this , we have that By the continuity of , there exists such that .
