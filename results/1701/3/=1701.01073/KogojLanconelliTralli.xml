<outline text="Introduction" _note="Aim of this paper is to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the regularity of a boundary point for the Dirichlet problem related to a class of hypoelliptic evolution equations of Kolmogorov-type. Our criterion is inspired both to the Evans–Gariepy’s Wiener test for the heat equation, and to a criterion by Landis, for the heat equation too, expressed in terms of a series of caloric potentials.  The partial differential operators we are dealing with are of the following type where and are real and constant matrices, is the point of and stand for the gradient, the divergence and the inner product in , respectively.  The matrix is supposed to be symmetric and positive semidefinite. Moreover, letting we assume that the following Kalman condition is satisfied: the matrix is strictly positive definite for every . As it is quite well known, the condition for is equivalent to the hypoellipticity of in , i.e to the smoothness of whenever is smooth (see, e.g., ). We also assume the operator to be homogeneous of degree two with respect to a group of dilations in . As we will recall in Section  , this is equivalent to assume and taking the blocks form and .  Under the above assumptions, one can apply results and techniques from potential theory in abstract Harmonic Spaces, as presented, e.g, in . As a consequence, for every bounded open set and for every function , the Dirichlet problem has a [GENERALIZED SOLUTION]{} in the sense of Perron–Wiener–Brelot–Bauer. The function is smooth and solves the equation in in the classical sense. However, it may occur that does not assume the boundary datum. A point is called [-REGULAR]{} for if  Aim of this paper is to obtain a characterization of the -regular boundary points in terms of a serie involving -potentials of regions in , the complement of , within different level sets of , the fundamental solution of . More precisely, if and are fixed, we define for Then, our main result is the following    Let be a bounded open subset of and let Then is -regular for if and only if  Here and in what follows, if is a compact subset of , will denote the [-EQUILIBRIUM POTENTIAL]{} of , and will denote its [-CAPACITY]{}. We refer to Section   for the precise definitions.  From Theorem  , one easily obtains a corollary resembling the Wiener test for the classical Laplace and Heat operators.    Let be a bounded open subset of and . The following statements hold:  if then is -regular;  if is -regular then  We can make the sufficient condition for the -regularity more concrete and more geometrical with the following corollary.    Let be a bounded open subset of and . If then is -regular. In particular, the -regularity of is ensured if has the exterior -cone property at .  If is a subset of either or , stands for the relative Lebesgue measure. Moreover, is the homogeneous dimension recalled in Section  , and the -cone property will be defined precisely in Section  . We just mention here that it is a natural adaptation of the parabolic cone condition to the homogeneities of the operator .  0.4cm  Before proceeding, we would like to comment on Theorem   and Corollary  .\ A boundary point regularity test for the heat equation involving infinite sum of (caloric) potentials was showed by Landis in . A similar test for a Kolmogorov equation in was obtained by Scornazzani in . Our Theorem   contains, extends, and improves the criterion in . The Wiener test for the heat equation was proved by Evans and Gariepy in . The extension of such a criterion to the Kolmogorov operators is an open, and seemingly difficult, problem. Our Corollary  , which is a straightforward consequence of Theorem  , is a Wiener-type test giving necessary and sufficient conditions which look “almost the same”. As a matter of fact, in Theorem   we have considered the -potentials of the compact sets which are built by the difference of two consecutive super-level sets of . These level sets correspond with the sequence of values . The exact analogue of the Evans-Gariepy criterion would have required the sequence with integer exponents . The presence of the logarithmic term, which makes the growth of the exponents slightly superlinear, is crucial for our proof of Theorem  . Moreover, such presence is also the responsible for the non-equivalence of the necessary and the sufficient condition in Corollary  . To complete our historical comments, we mention that a potential analysis for Kolmogorov operators of the kind first appeared in , in , and in . We also mention that the cone criterion contained in Corollary   has been recently proved in , where such a boundary regularity test has been showed for classes of operators more general than . For further bibliographical notes concerning Wiener-type tests for both classical and DEGENERATE operators, we refer the reader to .  The paper is organized as follows. In Section   we show some structural properties of and fix some notations. Section   is devoted to the potential theory for , while in Section   a crucial estimate of the ratio between the fundamental solution at two different poles is proved. In Section   the [ONLY IF]{} part of Theorem   is proved. The [IF]{} part, the core of our paper, is proved in Section  , where the estimates of Section   play a crucial rôle. Section   is devoted to the proof of Corollary   and Corollary  .">

It can be proved verbatim proceeding in our situation: the main tools are the facts that has integral over , and it reproduces the solutions of the Cauchy problems. Property appears to be new even in the classical parabolic case (at least to the best of our knowledge), and it can be deduced readily from .

The proof of this fact relies on the good behavior of , a representation formula of Riesz-type for -superharmonic functions proved in , and a Maximum Principle for (see ).  Fix now a bounded open set compactly contained in , and .

<outline text="Sufficient condition for regularity" _note="In this section we prove the [IF]{} part of Theorem  . This is the core of our main result and requires three lemmas.    Suppose we have a sequence of compact sets in such that Suppose also that the following two conditions hold true:        Then we have  Let , and fix any . Let us pick with such that We are going to denote by and by . We want to estimate on .\ Take . We have then for some . Of course we have . On the other hand, if we get Hence in . By the continuity of the equilibrium potentials (outside of their relative compact sets) there exists an open neighborhood of such that We put . In we get If we consider the function , we thus get in . Moreover, the function is a nonnegative -superharmonic in , it is -harmonic in , and it vanishes at the infinity. If we take any function we have The maximum principle infers that has to be nonnegative in . On the other hand, in . Therefore in , for every . This implies that In particular this has to be true at , i.e. Since the function is increasing, we deduce This concludes the proof since .  In order to simplify the notations, from now on we assume . This is not restrictive because of the left-invariance property. We want to choose suitably the compact sets of the previous lemma. For any fixed , we recall that Now, we set and denote We fix such that and are the constants in and . We also denote by So .

By our choice of , we have then and so This fact and the fact that the functions are increasing in the interval allow to bound the term further. Indeed, having , we get Since we have also , which says and implies Summing up, we have just proved that namely We are left with verifying with this definition of . We have thus to prove that The sequences and are asymptotically equivalent respectively to and . Hence, the series is equivalent to which is convergent since . This proves , and therefore the lemma.    There exists a positive constant such that  Fix any with . If , then and the statement is trivial. Thus, suppose . For every and we have By monotonicity we have . By our choice of we have then which implies . This fact allows us to exploit Lemma   and get for some structural positive constant . To prove the statement we need to show that the term is uniformly bounded for and . By estimating as in we have and analogously In order to bound we are thus going to estimate the term Since and is asymptotically equivalent to as goes to , it is easy to check that the sequences and are convergent to . Therefore they are a fortiori bounded. This proves the lemma.  As we noticed, it is not restrictive to assume . Then, our assumption implies for some fixed . Take as in . There exists at least one such that We can assume without loss of generality that , i.e. Let us split the sets as in . In this way we have defined the sequence of compact sets . We want to check that such a sequence satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma  .\ First of all, from , we have that the ’s are disjoint. Moreover, since , it is easy to see that the sets converge from below to the point (e.g., using that is -homogeneous of degree ). Lemma   provide the existence of a positive constant for which condition () in Lemma   holds true. The last assumption we have to verify is the condition (). To do this, we recall that the subadditivity of the equilibrium potentials implies that Lemma   says that is convergent. We then deduce which is condition ().\ Then, we can apply Lemma   and infer that for all positive . The regularity of the point is thus ensured by the characterization in .">
