    <title>The direct localization of a fast radio burst and its host</title>
    <abstract>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astronomical radio flashes of unknown
physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival
times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities
orders of magnitude larger than any other kind of known short-duration
radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs have been detected with large
single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to
identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on
contemporaneous variability of field sources or the presence of peculiar
field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted in an
unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart.
Here we report the sub-arcsecond localization of [FRB121102]{}, the only
known repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio
interferometric observations that directly image the bursts themselves.
Our precise localization reveals that [FRB121102]{} originates within
100 milliarcseconds of a faint 180 [Jy]{} persistent radio source with a
continuum spectrum that is consistent with non-thermal emission, and a
faint (twenty-fifth magnitude) optical counterpart. The flux density of
the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day timescales,
and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size less
than 1.7 milliarcseconds. Our observations are inconsistent with the
fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located
within a prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to
be co-located with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a
previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Localization and
identification of a host or counterpart has been essential to
understanding the origins and physics of other kinds of transient
events, including gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events. However,
if other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical
counterparts, our findings imply that direct sub-arcsecond localizations
of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable associations. </abstract>

  <outline text="Observation strategy." _note="Detection and precise localization of an FRB requires arcsecond angular resolution, millisecond time resolution, and MHz frequency resolution. In November 2015, we conducted 10 hours of fast dump (5 ms) observations of the [FRB121102]{} field with the VLA at 1.6 GHz, with no burst detections. In April–May 2016, we observed for 40 hours at 3 GHz, and again detected no bursts with either our fast imaging or beam-forming pipeline (described below). Detections of [FRB121102]{} with the 305-m Arecibo telescope suggested that VLA detections might be sensitivity limited, leading us to conduct a simultaneous observing campaign where Arecibo would identify a burst in the time domain and contemporaneous VLA observations would precisely localize it. In practice, this proved to be unnecessary for VLA detection, but it provided a wider frequency band to characterize the burst spectra.">

  <outline text="Arecibo observations." _note="Arecibo observations used the L-wide receiver, which provides a frequency range of  GHz. The PUPPI pulsar backend recorded full Stokes polarization information, with time and frequency resolutions of 10.24 s and 1.5625 MHz, respectively. Each frequency channel was coherently dedispersed to 557 []{}, thereby eliminating intra-channel dispersion smearing.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="VLA fast-dump observations." _note="The VLA fast-sampled interferometric data were recorded with 5 ms integration time, 256 channels, and bandwidth 1024 MHz centred at 3 GHz. We first detected [FRB121102]{} on 2016 August 23 with a signal-to-noise ratio S/N35. Through 2016 September, we continued coordinated Arecibo and VLA observations, detecting another 8 bursts at the same location and DM. In total, we acquired 83 hrs of fast-dump interferometric observations in three sessions: 2015 November at 1.6 GHz, 2016 April-May at 3 GHz, and 2016 August-September at 3 GHz with some observing at 6 GHz.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Millisecond imaging with fast-dump visibility data." _note="During the coordinated campaign, all bursts were detected with real-time analysis within hours of the data being recorded by the REALFAST system at the VLA. The real-time processing system de-dispersed visibilities to a small range of values centred on DM = 557.0 pc cm. For each integration and DM value, the pipeline formed a Stokes I image on time scales from 5 to 80 ms and saved images with peak S/N greater than 7.4, a threshold based on the known false positive rate due to thermal noise.  All candidates were re-analyzed offline with improved calibration, data cleaning, and refined localization using both custom, Python-based software and CASA. We calibrated and imaged de-dispersed visibilities with a typical sensitivity () of 5 mJy in 5 ms. Extended Data Table 1 lists burst properties, and the brightest detection is shown in Figure 1. By fitting a model of the synthesized beam to an image of the burst, we measure burst locations with statistical errors better than 0.3[]{}. However, the locations are affected by systematic errors at the level of about 1% of the synthesized beam sizes, a modest effect that is evident when comparing the localizations of the first four VLA burst detections (beam sizes 2.5[]{} 2[]{}) with the last five (beam sizes 1.3[]{} 0.8[]{}). Using just the last five burst centroids (with lower residual systematics due to the narrower beam), we find that the burst locations are consistent with the persistent radio continuum conterpart centroid (Extended Data Table 3 and Extended Data Figure 1). The radio continuum counterpart location is measured from the error-weighted mean of the location measured in deep imaging from 1 to 26 GHz (see below). The error in the offset is calculated from the quadrature sum of errors in each burst and the counterpart.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Beam-forming analysis with fast-dump visibility data." _note="Beam-forming is complementary to millisecond imaging: instead of de-dispersing interferometric visibilities and searching for bursts in the image domain, the visibilities are summed with appropriate phasing to produce time-frequency data that can be searched for dispersed bursts. For the VLA observations, the calibration tables generated from time-averaged data (see below) were applied to the fast-dump visibility data, and custom Python software and existing CASA tools were used to extract time-frequency data per beam from a tiling of synthesized beams covering the search region. The time-frequency data from each beam were then written to PSRFITS format and run through a single pulse search pipeline that used PRESTO pulsar processing tools. Single pulse candidates from all the synthesized beams were jointly filtered to remove candidates that occurred simultaneously in many beams, as well as candidates that were narrow-band, as these were likely caused by radio frequency interference. Diagnostic plots for the remaining candidates were examined by eye for bursts. The beam-forming pipeline was used to independently verify the times and positions of each of the VLA detected bursts. For the example shown in Figure 1, the instrumental time resolution for the observations (5 ms) is much larger than both the intrinsic pulse width and the intra-channel DM smearing, leading to a pixelated appearance.">

  <outline text="VLA imaging observations of the persistent counterpart." _note="The 3 GHz VLA fast-dump observations were also averaged down to lower time resolution, calibrated using the standard VLA pipeline procedures with CASA, and imaged at each epoch. Once the persistent counterpart to [FRB121102]{} had been identified, we used these per-epoch images to construct the light curve of the source, as well as a deep average image of the sky (Figure 2 and Extended Data Table 2). The variability of the persistent radio counterpart is uncorrelated with the detection of bursts; the point biserial correlation coefficient between the detection (or not) of a burst and the flux density of the counterpart is , which would be exceeded by chance 75% of the time. Of the 69 sources detected within a 5[]{} radius, nine (including the persistent counterpart) showed significant variability, as measured by , where is the source flux density and the image RMS at epoch , and is the epoch-averaged flux density.  We also acquired VLA imaging data covering a contiguous frequency range from 1 to 26 GHz. These observations utilized six separate receivers on the VLA: L- (1-2 GHz); S- (2-4 GHz); C- (4-8 GHz); X- (8-12 GHz); Ku- (12-18 GHz); and K-band (18-26 GHz). Observations were carried out on 2016 September 6 and 9, when the VLA was in the B-configuration, with maximum spacing between antennas of roughly 11 km (on September 9, a few antennas had been moved to their A-configuration locations). A third epoch was observed on September 28, only at C-band, with the VLA in the most extended A-configuration. Visibilities were dumped every 2 seconds, with channels of width either 1 or 2 MHz (depending on band). Calibration of the flux density scale was done using an observation of 3C 48 at all bands, and the secondary calibrator J0555+3948 was used to monitor complex gain (amplitude and phase) fluctuations as a function of time throughout each of the observations. Standard calibration was done with the VLA calibration pipeline, and subsequent imaging done in both CASA and AIPS. Final flux densities were estimated by a number of techniques to provide a cross-check, including [IMFIT]{} in CASA, JMFIT in AIPS, summing up CLEAN component flux density, and summing up flux density in the image pixels. Positions were measured using JMFIT. The two epochs (three for C-band) were imaged separately, and results between the two (three) were found to agree to within the uncertainties (Extended Data Figure 2), so visibility data from the two epochs (three for C-band) were combined together to make final images. Results are reported in Extended Data Table 3 and the measurements are plotted as part of the broad-band SED (Figure 3).">

  <outline text="Very Long Baseline Interferometry with the European VLBI Network." _note="The European VLBI Network (EVN) observed at 1.65 GHz in five epochs (2016 February 2, 10–11, 11–12 and 2016 May 24, May 25) for about two hours per session. The array included the 100 m Effelsberg, the 76 m Jodrell Bank, the 32 m Medicina, the 25 m Onsala, the 32 m Torun, the 25 m Westerbork (single dish), and the 305 m Arecibo telescopes. The data were streamed to the EVN Software Correlator (SFXC) at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE) in Dwingeloo, at a data rate of 1024 Mbit/s (512 Mbit/s for Arecibo) in real time. The individual station voltages were recorded simultaneously as well. During the first epoch, the ICRF source J0518+3306 was used as a phase-reference calibrator (separation from the field 2.9[]{}) and observations were alternated between the field (8 minutes) and the calibrator (2 minutes). For subsequent epochs we used J0529+3209 as phase-reference calibrator (separation 1.1[]{}) since it was proven to be sufficiently bright (60 mJy) and compact for the EVN from the first epoch observations.  Following the VLA localization of [FRB121102]{}, we re-correlated all our observations with the phase center at the [FRB121102]{} position. The data were analyzed with AIPS following standard procedures, and the images were made with the Caltech Difmap package. We did not detect the persistent counterpart during the first epoch due to a combination of technical failures and the distant phase calibrator. In the subsequent epochs we detected the persistent counterpart as a slightly resolved source with typical peak brightness of about 100 [Jy]{} beam and integrated flux density of about 200 [Jy]{}, and deconvolved source size of about 5 3 milliarcseconds at a position angle of 140[]{}. The naturally-weighted beam size was about 182.2 milliarcseconds in all cases, with a major axis position angle of 54[]{}; the noise was 7[Jy]{} beam. Brightness temperature lower limits from the four successful epochs are  K. (See Extended data Figure 2 and Table 3.)">

Second epoch observations were at  GHz (beam size 2.74 1.43 milliarcseconds at a position angle = 174.8[]{}). A total recording bandwidth of 2 Gbps with dual circular polarizations was obtained for each observation. As in the EVN observations, the compact calibrator J0529+3209 was used to provide phase referencing solutions for [FRB121102]{}. Standard interferometric calibrations were applied using AIPS. Images of the field achieved 17 and 12 [Jy]{} beam RMS at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz, respectively. The persistent counterpart to [FRB121102]{} was clearly detected in both observations with partially resolved compact structure. At 1.5 GHz, two-dimensional Gaussian deconvolution yields a size of 4.63.3 milliarcseconds, while the 5.0 GHz upper limit on the deconvolved size is 1.73 milliarcseconds.

  <outline text="Optical and infrared imaging" _note="We used the following optical imaging data: 630-s Keck -band image from 2014 November 19, 120-s Gemini -band image (2016 March 17), and 1250-s Gemini -band image (2016 October 24 and 25). The data were reduced with a combination of `IRAF`, `IDL` and [Python]{} tools. We used the URAT1 catalog as an astrometric reference frame. The astrometric errors were  mas (RMS) in all frames.

At the location of [FRB121102]{}, the total -band absorption, as determined from the COBE/DIRBE dust maps, is 2.42mag. We use published extinction coefficients to correct for absorption in the other bands. Published zeropoints and effective wavelengths and the IRAC Instrument Handbook v2.1.2 were used to obtain the flux density measurements and limits shown in the broadband spectrum of the persistent counterpart (Figure 3).">

  <outline text="X-ray Imaging with &lt;span&gt;XMM-NEWTON&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;CHANDRA&lt;/span&gt; X-ray Observatory" _note="X-ray observations were done with [XMM-NEWTON]{} (IDs 0790180201, 0790180501, 0792382801, and 0792382901) and the [CHANDRA]{} X-ray Observatory (ID 18717). The cameras aboard [XMM-NEWTON]{} consist of one EPIC-pn and two EPIC-MOS CCD arrays. The [CHANDRA]{} observation used the ACIS-S3 detector in TE mode. Two [XMM-NEWTON]{} observations occurred in 2016 February–March, before we achieved our precise localization, with pn in Large Window mode and the MOS cameras in Full Frame mode. Two more observations were performed in 2016 September with the pn camera in Small Window mode and the MOS cameras in Timing mode. A 40 ks [CHANDRA]{} observation was performed in 2015 November. In the first two [XMM-NEWTON]{} observations, the pn data were not usable for imaging [FRB121102]{} as it was positioned at the edge of a CCD chip. The MOS Timing mode observations are also not usable for imaging purposes. We therefore used 41 ks of pn data from 2016 September and 60 ks of MOS data from 2016 February–March for X-ray imaging.  We used standard tools from the XMM Science Analysis System (SAS) version 14.0, HEASoft version 6.19 and CAIO version 4.7 to reduce the data. The [XMM-NEWTON]{} images were mosaicked together using [emosaic]{} using exposure maps from [eexpmap]{}. The number of counts in a and radius circular region, for [XMM-NEWTON]{} and [CHANDRA]{}, respectively, centered at the position of [FRB121102]{} were compared to several randomly selected background regions. No significant deviation from the background was found; the 5 count rate limits are  counts s and  counts s. To place a flux limit we assume a photoelectrically absorbed power-law spectrum with a spectral index of and cm (the hydrogen column density implied by the DM– relation). Taking into account the telescopes’ energy-dependent effective area and Poisson statistics, we place a 5 limit of ergscm at 0.5–10 keV on an X-ray point source at the location of [FRB121102]{} using the mosaicked [XMM-NEWTON]{} image. Using the same procedure on the [CHANDRA]{} image also results in a limit of ergscm at 0.5–10 keV.">

  <outline text="Observational constraints on &lt;span&gt;FRB121102&lt;/span&gt; and its persistent counterpart." _note="Our observations support the conclusion that no Galactic source can explain the observed DM excess. If the compact counterpart contributes the excess DM over the maximum predicted by NE2001 along this line of sight, the requirement that it be optically thin at 1.4 GHz implies a lower limit on its size (L  pc), and hence the source distance. The VLBA and EVN compactness limits ( mas in any case, ignoring scattering contributions to angular extent) imply a minimum distance  Mpc, far beyond our Galaxy. The absence of an X-ray detection constrains an AGN counterpart. The fundamental plane relation between radio and X-ray luminosities and the black hole mass predicts that X-ray emission should be detected for black hole systems with and . However, not all AGN follow this relationship, including radio-loud AGN and systems with jet-ISM interactions. Radio-loud AGN are likely excluded based on the low radio luminosity erg s at . A black hole, which is plausible given the stellar mass upper limit, would have to accrete at below the Eddington rate to match the X-ray upper limit. Our observations are also inconsistent with a young radio supernova remnant, which is typically variable on a time scale of months and associated with star formation.  For a nominal Gpc distance corresponding to redshifts , the received fluence from each burst implies a burst energy The unknown emission solid angle could be very small due to relativistic beaming, and together with a distance possibly much smaller than 1 Gpc, could reduce the energy requirement significantly. However, the [TOTAL]{} energy emitted could be larger depending on the duration of the emission in the source frame and other model-dependent details. Either way, the burst energies from [FRB121102]{} are not inconsistent with those that might be expected from the magnetosphere of a compact object.">
