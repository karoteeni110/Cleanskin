<outline text="Pseudopotentials" _note="All density functional theory calculations were performed using [CASTEP]{} version , and its own “on-the-fly” ultrasoft pseudopotential for carbon. The definition string for the pseudopotential was:      2|1.4|1.4|1.3|6|10|12|20:21(qc=6)">

<outline text="Equilibrium positions" _note="The equilibrium positions of the 255 atoms in the tetrahedral symmetry structure with the experimental lattice constant are given in the file `TdSymmetry.cif`. The 4 nearest neighbours of the vacancy are the 1st, 37th, 41st and 69th atoms listed.">

<outline text="Soft mode displacement patterns" _note="The displacement patterns of the two soft modes, labelled by and in the main text, are given in the files `u1Displacements.cif` and `u2Displacements.cif`. The 4 nearest neighbours of the vacancy are the 1st, 37th, 41st and 69th atoms listed.">

<outline text="Born-Oppenheimer energy surface slices" _note="Figure   shows two cross-sections of the BO surface in the plane spanned by the two soft modes of the tetrahedral structure. Figure   shows a slice running from one of the three minima of the surface to the opposite high point passing through the origin of coordinates . Figure   shows a slice that runs from one minimum to an adjacent minimum, and this line does not cross the origin of coordinates.   ">
