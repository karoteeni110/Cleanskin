<outline text="Introduction" _note="The idea of taking derivatives of programs is an old one with many manifestations, including automatic differentiation of algorithms computing real-valued functions and incremental computation . However, these approaches are limited to restricted classes of computations, and it is only recently with the development of the differential -calculus by Ehrhard-Regnier and its refinement differential linear logic that derivatives have been defined for general higher-order programs. As with ordinary calculus, the aim of these theories is to assign to a program another program (the derivative) which computes the change in the output of resulting from an infinitesimal change to its input. Here we give ourselves arbitrary -linear combinations of programs (meaning -terms or proofs in linear logic) as a starting point so that “small” changes to the input make sense.  This paper is about the semantics of differential linear logic, following . The aim is to explain how the natural semantics of intuitionistic linear logic in vector spaces is already a model of differential linear logic. The key point is that tangent vectors and derivatives appear as soon as we introduce cofree coalgebras to model the exponential, which shows that the differential structure is intrinsic to the algebra of linear logic.  To see this, let denote semantics in vector spaces and suppose we are given a proof in linear logic computing a function from inputs of type to outputs of type : The space of inputs to is , and a small change in the input starting from is a tangent vector at , viewing as a smooth manifold or a scheme. This is equivalent to the data of a linear map @C+2pc[ ( /\^2)\^\* &amp; [A ]{} ]{} where is the ring of dual numbers (this bijection is reviewed in Appendix  ). If is the universal cocommutative counital coalgebra mapping to then there is a unique lifting of this linear map to a morphism of coalgebras   @C+2pc[ ( /\^2)\^\* &amp; [ A ]{}. ]{} Similarly the linear map lifts to a morphism of coalgebras which may be composed with to give a morphism of coalgebras   @C+2pc[ ( /\^2)\^\* &amp; [ A ]{} &amp; [ B ]{} ]{} which, in turn, defines a tangent vector at the point , where is the point of corresponding to . The tangent vector gives the infinitesimal variation of the output of on the input , when the input is varied in the direction of .  The formal statement is that for any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero the semantics of intuitionistic linear logic in -vector spaces defined using cofree coalgebras is model of differential linear logic (Theorem  ). We refer to this as the SWEEDLER SEMANTICS, since the explicit description of this universal coalgebra is due to him . The proof is elementary and we make no claim here to technical novelty; the link between the symmetric coalgebra and differential calculus is well-known. Perhaps our main contribution is to give several detailed examples showing how to compute these derivatives. We do this with the aim of reinforcing the fact that differentiating programs, even higher-order ones, is a natural thing to do.\ We conclude this introduction with a sketch of one such example and a comparison of our work to other semantics of differential linear logic. To elaborate a little more on the notation: for any type of linear logic (which for us has only connectives ) there is a vector space , and for any proof of there is a linear map . In particular every proof of type has a denotation , and the promotion of has for its denotation a vector , see .  For any binary sequence there is an encoding of as a proof of type Repetition of sequences can be encoded as a proof The denotation is a linear map sending to . The derivative of according to the theory of differential linear logic is another a proof which can be derived from by new deduction rules called codereliction, cocontraction and coweakening (see Section  ). We prove in Section   that the denotation of this derivative in the Sweedler semantics is the linear map whose value on the tensor we interpret as the derivative of the repeat program at the sequence in the direction of the sequence . This can be justified informally by the following calculation using an infinitesimal which says that varying the sequence infinitesimally from in the direction of causes a variation of the repetition in the direction of .\ The Sweedler semantics is far from the first semantics of differential linear logic: basic examples include the categories of sets and relations and suplattices . The motivating examples using topological spaces and differentiable functions are the Köthe and finiteness space semantics of Ehrhard and the semantics of Blute-Ehrhard-Tasson based on the theory of convenient vector spaces . These papers explain that the geometric “avatar” of the exponential connective of linear logic is the functor sending a space to the space of distributions on (for a precise statement, see Remark  ). This remarkable analogy between logic and geometry deserves further study. One obstacle is that it seems difficult to compute examples of denotations and their derivatives in the convenient vector space setting of . For example the coproduct is defined by extension to a Mackey closure, and is rather implicit.  Conceptually the Sweedler semantics is similar to these examples in that the exponential is modelled by a space of distributions (with finite support) but it is purely algebraic and there are simple explicit formulas for all the structure maps. Moreover in the algebraic approach the differential structure emerges naturally from the exponential structure, rather than being “baked in”. The downside is that the smoothness of proof denotations in our semantics is obscured; in particular, in the case some extra work is required to see the relation between our differential structure and the derivatives in the usual sense.\ For background material on linear logic and its semantics see . The formal theory of coalgebras is simpler over algebraically closed fields, which explains why we use in our examples, but this is not really important: one could work over by taking -points into account in the explicit description of the cofree coalgebra.\ ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

Briefly, (D.1) says the derivative of constant maps is zero, (D.2) is the product rule, (D.3) says the derivative of a linear map is constant, and (D.4) is the chain rule. Clearly the rules specify how to commute past the structural maps . Here stands for the dereliction rule in linear logic, for contraction and for weakening. The map stands for promotion, since for a linear map the unique lifting to a morphism of coalgebras can be obtained as the composite @C+2pc[ [!]{} V \^- &amp; [!!]{} V \^-[[!]{} ]{} &amp; [!]{} W. ]{}    We define the -linear map by   D\_V( \_P ) = \_P.

We prefer to give the proofs without first choosing a basis of , but if one is willing to do so, then the connection between these identities and the usual rules of calculus follows from writing the formula for the coproduct as a kind of Taylor expansion; see for example .  (D.1) holds for .  This is clear, since the counit vanishes on if .  (D.2) holds for .  Setting we have as claimed, where for we write for and for , we write for .  (D.3) holds for .

  <outline text="Codereliction, cocontraction, coweakening" _note="An alternative formulation of the differential structure in differential linear logic is in terms of CODERELICTION, COCONTRACTION and COWEAKENING maps; see and . This has the advantage of providing an appealing symmetry to the formulation of the syntax. In this section we briefly sketch the definition of these maps in the Sweedler semantics. Throughout linear logic means intuitionistic linear logic with the connectives .  First we recall the canonical commutative Hopf structure on of . Given vector spaces then (see ) there is an isomorphism of coalgebras Using this and the definitions in , it is easy to check that the product is while the antipode is and the unit is . By these maps make into a commutative (and cocommutative) Hopf algebra. In the terminology of the map is the COCONTRACTION map and is the COWEAKENING map (the antipode seems not to have a formal role in differential linear logic). Finally,  The CODERELICTION is the composite which is given by .  Note that we can recover as It seems more convenient to model differentiation syntactically using the codereliction, cocontraction and coweakening maps, rather than the deriving transformation itself. We briefly sketch how this works, following . In the sequent calculus for linear logic one introduces three new deduction rules “dual” to dereliction, contraction and weakening: together with new cut-elimination rules .    Given a proof of in linear logic, the DERIVATIVE is the proof  whose denotation is, by our earlier remark, the composite @C+2pc[ [!]{} [A ]{} [A ]{} \^-[D]{} &amp; [!]{} [A ]{} \^- &amp; [B ]{}. ]{}    Given as above we have the function \_[nl]{}: [A ]{} [B ]{}, P \_P, and for we interpret the vector D( \_P ) = \_P [B ]{} as the derivative of at the point in the direction of .

Let denote the proof which is the promotion of , which has for its denotation the unique morphism of coalgebras with .

Then the morphism of coalgebras   [() ]{} : (k /\^2)\^\* [!]{} [B ]{} has the following values, writing , we have by Under the bijection of Section   the morphism of coalgebras therefore corresponds to the tangent vector at .

<outline text="The cofree coalgebra" _note="Let be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and the category of -vector spaces (possibly infinite dimensional). It is straightforward to check that the universal counital cocommutative coalgebra mapping to a finite-dimensional vector space (i.e. the cofree coalgebra) is the space of linear functionals on the symmetric algebra which vanish on an ideal of finite codimension . Using the Chinese remainder theorem one sees further that this coalgebra breaks into a sum of pieces each isomorphism to a symmetric algebra, that is, that there is an isomorphism of coalgebras   \_k\^((V\^\*),k) \_[P V]{} \_P(V) where is the symmetric algebra with its usual coproduct structure. Following the tradition of linear logic, we denote this universal coalgebra . The explicit formulas for the coproduct , counit and universal morphism are given in and . The universality of means more precisely that for any cocommutative coalgebra there is an isomorphism where the left hand side denotes morphisms of -coalgebras.

  <outline text="Tangent vectors" _note="There is a well-known connection between the cofree coalgebra and tangent vectors, arising from the identification of the former with a coalgebra of distributions on . We review this point of view at the end of Section  . But first we recall the approach to this connection of which emphasises the ring of dual numbers . In algebraic geometry this ring represents tangent vectors, in the sense that there is a bijection between morphisms of -schemes and pairs consisting of a closed point and a tangent vector where is the maximal ideal.  When for a finite-dimensional vector space , the closed points of are in bijection with vectors in , and the tangent space is canonically isomorphic to . Hence a morphism is determined by two vectors . This data is naturally associated with the element as follows. Let with its natural coalgebra structure. Then Under these bijections the scheme morphism corresponds to the linear map : V\^\* k /(\^2), (f) = f(P) 1 + \_( f )|\_[x=P]{} and to the morphism of coalgebras   : [!]{} V, ( 1 ) = \_P, ( \^\* ) = \_P. This justifies the identification of with the tangent vector at .  Under the isomorphism the element corresponds to the functional taking the derivative of a function in the direction at . One way to talk about such distributions for arbitrary fields is the framework of local cohomology and residues, which we now recall from .">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Local cohomology and residues" _note="For a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension with , one proves using local duality that there is an isomorphism   \_[P V]{} H\^[n]{}\_[P]{}(R, \^n\_[R/k]{}) \_k\^((V\^\*),k) , where denotes local cohomology at . This isomorphism is defined by sending a class in the local cohomology at to the functional where denotes a generalised residue and the action by on local cohomology. The connection between and is given by an isomorphism identifying the identity in with the class of the meromorphic differential form H\^[n]{}\_[P]{}(R, \^n\_[R/k]{}). It is easy to see that and more generally that Thus we may identify elements of with functionals on the space of polynomial functions, given by taking derivatives at points of .  When with and the generator of , this is nothing but the Cauchy integral formula since we have \_P = , \_P = and the Cauchy formula says    When this agrees with the analytic theory of distributions, since by the -vector space of distributions on the real manifold supported at a point is spanned by the functions as and varies over all sequences in . So in this case we can identify the coalgebra with the space of distributions on with finite support.  In the semantics of differential linear logic defined using finiteness spaces and convenient vector spaces the space is a closure of the linear span of Dirac distributions (in our notation, ) on . More precisely, if is a finite-dimensional convenient vector space then consists of distributions of compact support, which are obtained as limits of Dirac distributions. For example, see for the limit defining the distribution in our notation. There is a very similar role for Dirac distributions in the Coherent Banach space semantics of linear logic in .  It is interesting to note that functional programs extended with Dirac distributions have already been considered in the literature on automatic differentiation; see . For an abstract categorical theory of distributions via monads, see .  Any cocommutative coalgebra is the direct limit of finite-dimensional coalgebras, and the category of finite-dimensional cocommutative coalgebras is isomorphic to the category of zero-dimensional schemes over . This is taken as the starting point of one approach to noncommutative geometry which has been influential in the study of -algebras, where one posits that an arbitrary coalgebra is the coalgebra of distributions on a “noncommutative space” , .    Definition   is justified as follows: adding to a ket, under the residue, contributes a partial derivative in the direction of by . Stating this in a different way, observe that there is a canonical map sending to the differential operator and we have a -linear map @C+2pc[ H\^n\_P(R, \^n\_[R/k]{}) V \^-[1 ]{} &amp; H\^n\_P(R, \^n\_[R/k]{}) (R) \^-[a]{} &amp; H\^n\_P(R, \^n\_[R/k]{}) ]{} where denotes the action of the ring on local cohomology .
