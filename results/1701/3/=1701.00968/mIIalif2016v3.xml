<outline text="Introduction" _note="The AdS/CFT holgraphic applications in strongly coupled quantum systems exhibiting nonrelativitic symmetries near critical points has been the focus of studies recently -. Some of the holographic applications may involve strongly coupled fermionic systems at finite density or a gas of ultra cold atoms . Some related framework of Galilean symmetry were studied even earlier . For finite temperature properties such as phase transitions, transport and viscosity we include black-holes in asymptotically AdS backgrounds. For superconductivity phenomenon the 4-dimensional non-relativistic geometry generically involves spontaneously broken Higgs phase where the Maxwell field is massive . We shall discuss here some examples of 10-dimensional Lifshitz spacetimes where a Higgs phase instead involves 2-rank antisymmetric tensor field and has massive fundamental strings. The two phenomena indeed have parallel from 10-dimensional perspective. It is because a Kaluza-Klein compactification of a (massive) 2-rank tensor field on a circle gives rise to a (massive) gauge field in lower dimensions.  Our main interest in this work is to construct Lifshitz solutions with dynamical exponent , directly in Roman’s type IIA supergravity . The massive type IIA theory is the only known example of a 10-dimensional maximal supergravity where the string field is explicitly massive at the tree level. Thus the massive type IIA provides an unique setup to look for Lifshitz and Schrödinger like solutions which involve massive fields and study their dual nonrelativistic field theories on the boundary. There are no prior attempts to our knowledge where the same has been worked out for Romans type IIA supergravity, however massive string vacua are known to us . The have been shown to exist in type IIB string theory when appropriate axion flux is switched on . We provide an exlicit example of background, which is a solution of massive type IIA and it does involve massive -field. It is a background generated by a bound state of brane system. It is important to know all such vacua as their compactification on immediately provides the prototype background in , which is proposed to be dual to non-relativistic Lifshitz theory with dynamical exponent two. By exploiting massive T-duality symmetries in we further provide another example of background, which is generated by massless brane system in ordinary type IIA theory.  The paper is organised as follows. In the section-2 we first review the relevant aspects of massive type IIA sugra action and its known Schrödinger solution. In section-3 we write down new Lifshitz solution generated by the system and discuss subtle aspects under massive T-duality for these solutions. The section-4 contains ordinary type IIA solution involving branes, which is supported by RR 2-form flux and massless -field. They have a very crucial coupling between them. The string -field gets essentially nested with constant magnetic flux of over plane. We next discuss their consistent reduction to four and five dimensions and their effective bulk theories in section-5. We provide an M-theory uplift of these vacua in section-6. A summary is provided in the section-7.">

<outline text=": massive strings" _note="In this section we mainly review some useful information about 10-dimensional massive type IIA supergravity and a known Schrödinger vacua . One may choose to directly skip to the next section. The Romans type IIA theory is the only known maximal supergravity in ten dimensions which allows massive string field. The theory is described by the following bosonic action S=[1G\_N]{}where topological terms have been dropped because these would be vanishing for the Lifshitz backgrounds we shall be studying in this paper, see for details in .[^1] The field strengths are defined as H\_[(3)]{}=dB\_[(2)]{},   G\_[(2)]{}=dC\_[(1)]{} +m B\_[(2)]{},     G\_[(4)]{}=dC\_[(3)]{} +B\_[(2)]{}dC\_[(1)]{} + [m2]{} B\_[(2)]{}B\_[(2)]{} where is the mass parameter and positive cosmological constant of the 10-dimensional theory. The cosmological constant however generates a nontrivial potential term for the dilaton field. Other than the nonsupersymmetric Freund-Rubin vacua in , some known BPS solutions of the theory include D8-branes , the compactifications , the and bound states . Under the ‘massive’ T-duality the D8 brane can be mapped over to a D7 brane in ordinary type IIB string theory. The string -field is explicitly massive with mass square given by , and it plays an important role in obtaining nonrelativistic Schrödinger solutions . The massive type IIA theory however never admits a flat Minkowski vacuum solution. But in the limit the massive theory reduces to ordinary type IIA supergravity.  An observed common feature in four-dimensional AdS gravity theories has been that in order to obtain Schrödinger or Lifshitz type non-relativistic solutions one needs to include massive (Proca) gauge fields in the action . (Although massless gauge fields can give rise to nonrelativistic vacua however, in simple cases of D-branes compactified along lightcone coordinate , they usually give rise to conformal (or hyperscaling) Lifshitz or Schrödinger vacua.) Particularly for massive type IIA theory the existence of Schrödinger solution has already been shown in . In the rest of this section we review the Schrödinger solution to familiarise ourselves, and also because these vacua are constituted by D0, D2, D8 branes, alongwith massive strings which we will encounter again when we write down Lifshitz solutions of the theory.  The massive type IIA action in the tensorial notation is given by   S=[1G\_N]{}d\^[10]{}x , with the field strengths . The equations of motion of this theory admit following solution   &amp;&amp;ds\^2=L\^2(-[2z\^[6]{}]{} (dx\^[+]{})\^2+[-2dx\^[+]{}dx\^[-]{}+dy\^2+dz\^2z\^2]{} +[52]{} d\_6\^2 ) ,&amp;&amp;e\^=g\_a,    C\_[+-y]{}= - g\_a\^[-[14]{}]{} [L\^33 z\^3]{},    C\_[+]{}= -[3]{}[ g\_a\^[-3/4]{}Lz\^3]{} &amp;&amp; B\_[+ y]{}= -[g\_a L\^22z\^4]{}  , where . But we should have string coupling and . The radius of curvature of the sphere is directly related to the mass parameter. Note that the Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken in the solutions, although spin group of the sphere is intact. The Schrödinger vacua [( )]{} involves a collection of D0, D2, and D8 branes (which are wrapped around ), along with massive fundamental strings (F1) stretched along direction. The Einstein equations do involve a nontrivial stress-energy tensor component that receives contributions from the lightlike components of these fields. From the solution we learn that in ten-dimensional sense the matter (dust) responsible for a Schödinger solutions is made up of D-branes and most importantly the [MASSIVE]{} strings. The boundary of the spacetime is located at , and near to the boundary the metric and fields become divergent, which usually is the case for non-relativistic vacua with .

  <outline text="D2-D8: tied up with massive strings" _note="It is known that the Freund-Rubin maximally symmetric vacua in Romans theory is constituted by branes. But there are no ‘massive’ -field excitations in them. We show that one can construct Lifshitz vacua that are supported by massive -field, D2 and D8 branes. The strings in these solutions becomes massive after gobbling up all D0 branes, unlike the Schrödinger type vacua [( )]{} above where some D0 branes are still present. Thus the D0 brane charges will not be explicitly seen in the following Lifshitz solutions.

The D0 branes are all gauged away (or eaten up) by the F-strings which have become massive. This phenomenon happens due to the higgsing (or stueckelberg mechanism) in massive type IIA theory . In these solutions remains an overall isometry direction which may be compact also. The holographic coordinate acts as a common transverse direction for all the branes.

  <outline text="" _note="The 10-dimensional string coupling has to be weak so that we can trust the Lifshitz vacua [( )]{}. The small however tends to send the mass of F-strings to higher values, but for sufficiently large it can support massive strings in the background (note the lighter ones with only need to be excited). So far we considered as noncompact coordinate and an associated arbitary length scale. Let us consider the case when is a compact circle, . The physical radius of -circle will be . Therefore for smaller values the massive strings can indeed be excited in the transverse direction of the D2-branes. It would also be appropriate here to take , with being an integer.

  <outline text="Massive  T-duality" _note="Upon compactification the Romans theory gives rise to a massive supergravity in nine dimensions. Keeping only the fields relevant for our background [( )]{}, (a complete circle compactification can be found ) a massive action can be written as   S\~d\^[9]{}x e\^[-2\_9]{}, where the vector field which arises directly from reduction of massive tensor component is only kept in the action. The dilaton field is given by whereas defines the radion mode along . (The fields are denoted with a hat sign to distinguish them from 9-dimensional ones.) The Kaluza-Klein gauge field is set to vanish. The topological terms in the action are also ignored as these are not relevant for the Lifshitz background we are studying here. By setting , after compactification along the eq.[( )]{} reduces to   &amp;&amp;ds\^2\_[9d]{}=L\^2(- [dt\^2z\^4]{} +[dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2+dz\^2z\^2]{} + d\_5\^2 ) ,&amp;&amp;e\^[\_[9]{}]{}= g\_a ,    C\_[(3)]{}= -[L\^3g\_a z\^4]{}dtdx\_1dx\_2 &amp;&amp; A\_[(1)]{}= [L\^2q z\^2]{}dt,     e\^[-]{}=q\^2 L\^[-2]{} , It can be checked that [( )]{} is a consistent solution of the action [( )]{}. Actually both the dilaton and the have constant background values. Since it is a solution of type II sugra with a massive vector field, the above Lifshitz vacua can be uplifted back to 10-dimensional type IIB theory (over a dual radius circle) by exploiting ‘massive’ T-duality . By employing the massive duality rules we get following type IIB solution   &amp;&amp;d[s]{}\^2\_[IIb]{}=L\^2( [\^2]{}[d\^2]{} - [2 dt dz\^2]{} +[dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2z\^2]{}+[dz\^2z\^2]{} + d\_5\^2 ) &amp;&amp; G\_[(5)]{}= [1g\_b]{}( [4L\^4z\^5]{}dtdx\_1dx\_2d dz + [self dual]{}) &amp;&amp;e\^[\_b]{}=g\_b ,      = [2g\_b]{} y  . The type IIB string coupling , radius of curvature , and flux are all independent parameters. The coupling should be kept small. The parameter determines the required axion flux and also the relative size of in the metric. (Recall an ordinary type IIB theory has no mass scale of its own unlike the Romans’ type IIA theory.) The massive T-duality does indeed relate with Romans’ mass through g\_b=g\_a [qL]{},    m=[2g\_a L]{},    Note the flux parameter has mass dimension one. The vacua [( )]{} describes Lifshitz solution of type IIB theory first obtained by , if we redefine the coordinates as .  Note that the axion field has a linear dependence on the circle coordinate (), where via T-duality. Due to this the axion undergoes discrete jumps (determined by parameter ) each time it goes around the circle, as it has to be periodic. One should take with an integral . The will now effectively count the axions (or the number of D7 branes) Q\_[D7]{}=[12]{}d=[q]{}[R\_y]{}=w . The D3 charge is given by   Q\_[D3]{}\~[1\_5]{} G\_[(5)]{} = [2 L\^4 g\_b]{} N taking . Thus the eq.[( )]{} describes a bound state of system with wave. The coordinates and together constitute two transverse directions of D7 branes. It is the same kind of effect which the massive T-duality brings under which D8-brane of massive type IIA is mapped over to D7-brane in type IIB and vice-versa . Thus we have confirmed that the Romans type IIA theory with massive -field admits Lifshitz vacua and it also provides a consistent T-dual description of the Lifshitz vacua of type IIB string theory.  The vacua presented here are different from other Lifshitz vacua obtained in and gauged/massive supergravities with arbitrary dynamical exponents in . Those and vacua with (the being sphere, hyperboloid or flat space) can also be lifted to , but these are different cases. Only dilatonic scalars are present in those gauged/massive sugra theories. We are note sure if they could be ralated to background.">

<outline text="dual of  system" _note="The 8-dimensional type II supergravity has a T-duality group including the massive version of supergravity . Under this massive duality symmetry the mass parameter (or dual 10-form flux) in Romans theory compactified on gets mapped into -flux (along 2-torus) in ordinary type-IIA compactified on . Using this massive duality we would like to map vacua [( )]{} into the -flux vacua of ordinary type IIA theory.  Let us choose and to be the coordinates along . The RR 2-form flux corresponds to having a nonvanishing constant magnetic component G\_[flux]{}dx\_1dx\_2 =[2 g\_aL]{}dx\_1dx\_2 filling the entire .

It is quite plausible because D0 branes are delocalised over plane as well as there is nontrivial magnetic flux . (The negative scaling exponent of spatial coordinates is usually associated with negative pressure along those direction in the CFT.)[^1]  The background [( )]{} is unique Lifshitz vacuum in the sense that it describes two ‘electrically’ charged objects interacting with a magnetic flux. It can be checked that the Lifshitz vacua [( )]{} is indeed a solution of following massless effective action   S\_[4d]{}\~ where is 4-dimensional dilaton field and field strength . Note that the scaling of the fields in [( )]{} gives rise to following property of the action: S\_[4d]{} . One thing to observe is that there is no mass term for gauge fields in the action [( )]{}. However two Maxwell fields in the action have Chern-Simons like interaction between them. Hence they give rise to two types of charged objects with a Chern-Simons like interaction between them. The boundary Lifshitz theory lives over 2-dimensional spatial plane. By constant scaling of the fields the action [( )]{} can be brought to a canonical form   S\_[4d]{}\~ and corresponding solution also can be written as [^2]   &amp;&amp;ds\^2=L\^2(- [dt\^2z\^4]{} +[z\^2L\^4]{}(dx\_1\^2+dx\_2\^2)+[dz\^2z\^2]{} ) ,&amp;&amp;e\^[\_4]{}=g\_0[z\^2L\^2]{},     C\_[(1)]{}= [1g\_0]{}(-[L\^3z\^4]{} dt - [x\_2L]{} dx\_1 +[x\_1L]{}dx\_2), &amp;&amp; \_[(1)]{}= -[Lz\^2]{}dt  , where is coupling constant. The parameter has altogether disappeared from the solutions [( )]{} and it only determines the coupling . Since the dilaton runs towards strong coupling in the IR, this solution gives valid CFT descrition only in the (near UV region). In the UV region the Lifshitz theory becomes almost free.  It is tempting to holographically relate the bulk theory [( )]{} to some known nonrelativistic condensed matter phenomenon in a plane on the boundary, involving two distinct (electrical) charges interacting in presence of constant magnetic field (or current), somewhat like in quantum Hall effect. There are no mass terms for gauge fields hence the solution [( )]{} cannot describe superconducting or higgs phase. For the bulk solution [( )]{}, the gauge interaction terms in the action [( )]{} is very crucial, but it is of rather unusual type to motivate. However it is not uncommon for such tensorial interactions to arise in bulk gravity (string) theory. The massless gauge-gravity action [( )]{} certainly represents a new critical phenomenon, but it is also related via ‘massive’ T-duality to another action having massive gauge fields [( )]{} and describing superconducting phenomenon .  Next the gauge field specially couples to the dilaton hence it is distinct as compared to the other gauge field which is totally decoupled from dilaton in [( )]{}. The former may thus have its origin in the Hall (excitaions) carriers. As we understand from the quantum Hall effect that, there is a constant magnetic field uniformally spread over a plane alongwith an electric field (EMF) applied in one (say ) direction of the plane. Consequently a quantized Hall voltage (current) gets generated along another (here ) direction of the planar system. From this analogy we understand that can possibly be the source of Hall charges. In holography, the boundary value of the time-component of bulk gauge field represents charge sources in boundary. Furthermore, is essentially a component of string -field (wrapped on circle). Since and is an important overall parameter. We find that the two gauge potentials behave as \_0\~O(N\^[14]{}),      C\_0\~O(N\^[34]{})Thus their respective carrier concentrations would have difference. However if we compare respective Lorentz invariants in the action involving electric and magnetic fields, then &amp;&amp;e\^[-2\_4]{}(\_z[A]{}\_0)\^2 \~-[4g\_0\^2L\^6]{}z\^4 ,&amp;&amp;(\_z[ C]{}\_0)\^2\~-[16 g\_0\^2 L\^6 ]{} z\^4 ,&amp;&amp;(\_i[ C]{}\_j)\^2\~[4g\_0\^2 L\^6]{} z\^4  . It shows that, though the electric field contribution of is comparatively weaker by a factor of , but in the lagrangian [( )]{} all gauge terms contribute with equal strengths due to varied dilatonic couplings. These on-shell quantities do not diverge near the boundary. Furthermore, in the bulk solution [( )]{} we can in fact choose a gauge such that components are only nonvanishing alongwith . This implies existence of two independent sources of charge (EMF) and an indepedent electric current in the boundary theory.  [^1]: The nonrelativisitic phenomenon is expressed by the hamiltonian ,     and the scaling property [( )]{} implies that the     quasi-particle masses must scale as . Hence the particle mass     (number) increases when we probe bigger length scales (or at low     energy).

Note that the string coupling tends to blow up at shorter length scales (UV), while at longer (IR) scales it becomes almost a free theory. Thus the Lifshitz background [( )]{} is suitable for describing a low energy Lifshitz theory at large length scales . (While at shorter scales, , the previous background [( )]{} is more suitable.) In the present case the boundary field theory may actually describe electrodynamics because coupling remains weaker at longer distances.

<outline text="Summary" _note="We have shown that for the Romans’ type IIA supergravity the brane configuration gives rise to the Lifshitz vacua . For this Lifshitz solution the fundamental strings have to be massive with , and such that and . A compactification of the massive type IIA theory on relates -dimensional background with corresponding Scherk-Schwarz reduced type IIB Lifshitz vacua compactified on a dual circle. This duality map is known as ‘massive’ T-duality . It has been known in litrature that spacetime is constituted by axion-flux system in type IIB string theory. The presence of D7-branes primarily requires constant axion flux switched on along in these solutions. None of these solutions preserve any supersymmetry.  Further, using ‘massive’ T-duality symmetry in eight dimensions, we have related the Lifshitz vacua in Romans theory to yet another vacua which is constituted by brane system of ordinary type IIA theory. But these latter vacua have negative dynamical exponents along two CFT directions. The interesting observation is that this solution upon exlicit compactification along gives rise to Lifshitz vacua with two distinct types of electric charges supported by a constant magnetic flux (or current), all entirely living over plane at the boundary. We speculate that this may represent phenomena akin to quantum Hall systems. We also have obtained M-theory uplift of the Lifshitz solutions.
