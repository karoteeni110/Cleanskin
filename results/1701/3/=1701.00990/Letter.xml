    <title>Computation of the transmitted and polarized scattered fluxes\
by the exoplanet HD 189733 in X-rays</title>
    <abstract>[Thousands of exoplanets have been detected, but only one exoplanetary
transit was potentially observed in X-rays from HD 189733A. What makes
the detection of exoplanets so difficult in this band? To answer this
question, we run Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations to estimate
the amount of X-ray flux reprocessed by HD 189733b Despite its extended
evaporating-atmosphere, we find that the X-ray absorption radius of
HD 189733b at 0.7 keV, the mean energy of the photons detected in the
0.25–2 keV energy band by XMM-Newton, is 1.01 times the planetary radius
for an atmosphere of atomic Hydrogen and Helium (including ions), and
produces a maximum depth of 2.1% at  min from the center of the
planetary transit on the geometrically thick and optically thin corona.
We compute numerically in the 0.25–2 keV energy band that this maximum
depth is only of 1.6% at  min from the transit center, and little
sensitive to the metal abundance assuming that adding metals in the
atmosphere would not dramatically change the density-temperature
profile. Regarding a direct detection of HD 189733b in X-rays, we find
that the amount of flux reprocessed by the exoplanetary atmosphere
varies with the orbital phase, spanning between 3–5 orders of magnitude
fainter than the flux of the primary star. Additionally, the degree of
linear polarization emerging from HD 189733b is 0.003%, with maximums
detected near planetary greatest elongations. This implies that both the
modulation of the X-ray flux with the orbital phase and the
scattered-induced continuum polarization cannot be observed with current
X-ray facilities.]{} </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Hitherto, the main exoplanet detection technique relies on spectroscopic and photometric transits[^1]. If a planet passes in front of a star, the star will be partially eclipsed and its flux will be dimmed by the successive coverage and uncoverage of the stellar surface by the transiting planet, resulting in detectable dips in the stellar light curve. In the optical and infrared bands, where most of the transit detection occurred, those transit depths are of the order of 1–3%, e.g., 1.6% for HD 209458b , and 2.45% for HD 189733b . If the photospheric disk has a uniform emission (i.e., there is no limb-darkening), these depths are equal to the square of the ratio of the exoplanet radius () to the stellar radius (). From multi-wavelength light curves, it becomes possible to characterize the atmosphere and exosphere of giant exoplanets , but additional measurements are needed to estimate the mass of the planet, the orbital parameters, and the inclination angle. These results can be achieved thanks to radial velocity measurements, orbital brightness modulations, gravitational microlensing, direct imaging, astrometry, and polarimetry. The later is probably one of the most delicate methods since the anticipated white light polarization degree (about 10, ) resulting from scattering of stellar photons onto the atmospheric layers of Hot Jupiters is expected to be just about detectable given the current limits of current optical, broad-band, stellar polarimeters . reported to have successfully achieved a -band polarimetric detection of HD 189733b and found a peak polarization of 210 (i.e. 0.02 %) and a cosine-shaped distribution of polarization over the orbital period. From those results, inferred additional constraints on the size of the scattering atmosphere of HD 189733b, and on the orientation of the system with respect to the Earth-primary line of sight. Yet there is no reliable measurement of the true scattered light polarization from HD 189733b in the -band, as and reported an absence of large amplitude polarization variations. Even if their observations are consistent with a plausible polarization amplitude from the planet, the low significance of the polarimetric observations cannot be used as a claim for detection. This highlights the difficulty of POLARIMETRIC measurements of exoplanets in the optical band. However, SPECTROSCOPIC detection of exoplanets has been quite successful at all wavebands, except at X-rays energies.  It is unfortunate since X-ray photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry could help to constrain the composition and morphology of the exoplanet’s atmosphere. reported for HD 189733 the detection in the 0.25–2 keV energy band of a transit depth estimate ranging from 4.02.7% to 7.32.5% (see in their Table 6 the limb-brightened model), which might be larger than the transit depth in optical of 2.3910.001%, computed for a uniformly emitting disk using the planetary radius of . These values of transit depths in X-rays were obtained by fitting the X-ray broad-band light curve using the analytic chromospheric transit of that assumes a geometrically thin emission. However, the corona of the Sun (a normal star) is by definition located above the chromosphere and the solar coronal plasma is extended above the photosphere , therefore, a zero thickness is not appropriate to describe the geometry of the corona of HD 189733A, a moderately active star. Moreover, the normalized phase-folded X-ray light curve of HD 189733A is affected for a phase binning of 0.005 (corresponding to 958 s) by large statistical noise (5%; Poisson noise from added-up raw count rate out transit in Table 5 of ) and astrophysical (white noise) scatter (4%; see bottom right panel of Fig. 12 in the Appendix of ) that hinders any fitting. Therefore, more sensitive X-ray observations of the transit of HD 189733b are mandatory to obtain an accurate measurement of the shape of the planetary transit of the corona of HD 189733A and to better constrain its maximum depth.  In any case, the first indirect detection of an extra-solar planet in the 0.1 – 10 keV energy range opens new questions: What is the expected X-ray absorption radius and scattered flux from giant exoplanets? Is a DIRECT detection of giant exoplanets feasible in this energy band? Is, similarly to the optical band, a polarimetric detection within the reach of future instruments? To solve those issues, it is necessary to estimate the host-star flux reprocessed by the exoplanet gaseous surface first, and then to compute the resulting scattering-induced polarization. It is a particularly relevant issue since we have known for decades that stellar X-ray polarimetry is a very powerful diagnostic tool .  In this regards, HD 189733b is one of the best laboratories for giant exoplanet studies. HD 189733 is a binary system, situated at a distance of about 19.45 pc from the Sun . The primary component HD 189733A is a main-sequence star of stellar type K1.5 V, mass 0.846  , radius 0.805  and rotational period 11.953 days . HD 189733A emits about 10erg.s in the 0.25 – 2 keV band, corresponding to times its bolometric luminosity, which is about 10 times larger than the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity observed from the Sun at its maximum . The secondary component of spectral type M4 V is located at an angular separation of 114 ( 216 au) from HD 189733A with an orbital period is 3200 years and it is approximatively two orders of magnitude fainter in X-rays than HD 189733A . The exoplanet HD 189733b with mass 1.162  and radius 1.26 , was discovered by transit observations in optical . Orbiting around HD 189733A in 2.219 days , this Hot Jupiter is situated at only 0.031 au from its host star. Due to its proximity from Earth and its favorable observing geometrical conditions — its orbital plane is parallel within about 4 of our line of sight and its orbit is nearly circular — HD 189733b stands as the perfect object for observations and numerical modeling.  Hence, in this paper, we aim to investigate the HD 189733A planetary system in terms of photometry and continuum polarization. Focusing our study on soft X-rays, where the stellar coronal emission peaks, we build in Sect.   a template X-ray spectrum for the corona of HD 189733A and a model for the atmosphere of HD 189733b according to the latest observational constraints. We present the Monte-Carlo code that we used to perform our calculations of radiative transfer and report the very first estimations of the reprocessed flux emerging from the outer atmospheric layers of HD 189733b, along with its resulting X-ray polarization, in Sect.  . In Sect.  , we discuss our results in the context of present and future X-ray facilities, and conclude our paper in Sect.  .

The X-ray spectra of the quiescent corona obtained with XMM-Newton and Chandra are well described by two-isothermal plasma . Each isothermal plasma is characterized by an electronic temperature and a corresponding emission measure, defined as for a fully ionized plasma where the electronic density, , is equal to the ion density. The photoelectric absorption above 0.2 keV along the line of sight is negligible since the distance of this star is low.  We use the spectral fitting parameters of the quiescent corona obtained on April 17, 2007 with XMM-Newton by for a distance of  pc: a cool plasma component with  keV (corresponding to  MK) and  cm, and warm plasma component with =0.71 keV (corresponding to  MK) and  cm.

  <outline text="Model of the HD 189733 quiescent corona" _note="The X-ray emitting plasma of the Sun corona is visible both in active regions where it is confined in magnetic loops and in the most homogeneous parts of the quiet Sun corona where there is any detectable features of magnetic loops; both coronal regions extending well above the photosphere. For HD 189733A only the large-scale magnetic topology is accessible from Zeeman-Doppler imaging, showed that “[IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT OF THE SUN ; IT INVOLVES IN PARTICULAR A SIGNIFICANT TOROIDAL COMPONENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MAGNETIC MULTIPOLES OF ORDER UP TO 5]{}&quot;. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to use this magnetic topology as a scaffold to build a model of the X-ray emitting plasma of the HD 189733A corona (see, e.g., ). We focus on the quiescent and diffuse corona, which is more representative of the average plasma distribution on the stellar surface. Therefore, following our template spectrum, we model the quiescent corona as two isothermal-plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium (see Sect. 3.3 of ).  In the isothermal approximation, the pressure scale height is defined as:  where is the Boltzmann’s constant, is the mean particle weight, is the mass of the hydrogen atom, and is the stellar gravitational field. For HD 189733, we obtain:  cm. Therefore, and . Since the pressure is obtained by , the electronic density scale height is identical to the pressure scale height in the isothermal approximation. Neglecting the variation of the gravitational field with the height above the photosphere, , the electronic density, , follows an exponential profile:  We introduce, , the fraction of the corona outer area that is not eclipsed by the stellar disk for an observer on Earth (Eq. 5 of ):  with . Obviously, only half of the coronal area is visible when (), and the coronal area is fully visible when ().  The observed emission measure must be computed on the coronal volume that is not eclipsed by the stellar disk:  with the differential emission measure  From Eq.  –  and the values of the observed electronic temperatures and emission measures, we derive numerically the electronic density at the base of the corona:  cm and  cm; Fig.   shows the corresponding profiles of the coronal electronic density.  We obtain the profile of the photon number emitted by the corona for an energy, , and a height, , above the corona:  where is the width of the spectral bin of the ancillary response file at energy , and is the X-ray photon flux (in unit of photons cm s keV) for a plasma temperature of and a normalization of 1 (i.e., parameter ).  The ratio of warm-to-cool plasma emissivity in Eq.   is plotted versus the energy in Fig.  , using the energy sampling of the unfolded spectrum. Peaks and dips are due to emission lines from the warm and cool plasma, respectively. In the 0.25-2 keV energy band, the minimum and maximum values are 0.06 and 262 achieved at 0.57 and 2.00 keV, respectively. For a spectral energy resolution of  eV, is equal to 0.45 at  keV. Figure   shows the resulting normalized profile of the photons emitted by the corona at obtained using Eq.  . Figure   shows the corresponding emission intensity integrated along the line of sight versus , the distance from the stellar center. The emission intensity is maximum at the stellar limb and decreases from it with the distance, more or less slowly depending of the small or large contribution, respectively, of the warm plasma compared to the cool plasma to the coronal emission. Therefore, the size of the coronal emission varies with energy: the smallest and largest sizes are observed at 0.57 and 2.00 keV, respectively.  We define the quiescent corona has layers of constant, isotropic, and optically thin emission, above an optically thick sphere of radius (Fig.  ). Since ordinary bremsstrahlung emission from plasma shows no intrinsic polarization due to the random motions of electrons , we consider only unpolarized X-ray photons from the stellar corona.">

    <outline text="X-ray absorption radius" _note="The planetary absorption radius during transit is defined as the distance in the plane of the sky from the planetary center where the optical depth through the atmosphere along the line-of-sight, , is equal to unity. The total photon extinction cross-section in X-rays is the sum of photoelectric absorption and scattering cross-sections. The latter is the sum of coherent (Rayleigh) and incoherent (Compton) scattering by bound electrons in atoms/molecules . For comparison, we compute these cross-section components for an atmosphere of neutral Hydrogen and Helium with solar abundances [^1] with the [XCOM]{} [^2]. At 1 keV the total photon cross-section is 46.5 barn/H atom, composed at 98.1% by the photoelectric absorption (45.6 barn/H atom), this proportion decreases with higher energy. The scattering cross-section at 1 keV is dominated by the coherent (Rayleigh) process with 0.8 barn/H atom compared to 0.1 barn/H atom for the incoherent (Compton) scattering. Therefore, we will neglect the scattering cross-sections in our analytic computation at 0.7 keV.  The simplified solution of the absorption radius proposed by is only valid for a geometrically thin atmosphere and can not be used [A PRIORI]{} here due to the extended evaporative-wind. From the geometrical parameters introduced in Fig.  , the optical depth at energy through the planetary atmosphere along the line-of-sight is computed versus the distance from the planetary center, , as follows:  with , the total Hydrogen number density, and the photoelectric cross-section per Hydrogen atom, where is the metallicity.  The photoelectric cross-section at the distance from the planetary center and energy is computed as:  with , , and the ionic fractions (see bottom panel of Fig.  ); the abundance in number of the neutral element relative to the hydrogen and the photoelectric cross-section of the neutral or ionized element relative to the hydrogen . Since the dust grains in the planetary atmosphere are optically thin to X-rays due to their small sizes ( m), there is no self-blanketing effect, i.e., no decrease of the X-ray cross-section due to some element in the solid phase .  Following , we will only consider in our simulation atomic Hydrogen and Helium photoelectric cross-sections (Fig.  ). Since and , the contribution of the molecular Hydrogen in the low atmosphere to an increase of the photoelectric cross-section is small. However, metal abundances has a strong impact on the photoelectric absorption. Since ions (e.g., He) have lower photoelectric cross-section than neutral elements (fully ionized elements have obviously a null photoelectric cross-section), the ionized escaping atmosphere is more transparent to X-rays than the lower atmosphere.  Figure   shows the variation of the optical depth (Eq.  ) at 0.7 keV versus the distance to the planetary center. We find that the planetary absorption radius at 0.7 keV, is 1.008  (corresponding to 0.156 ), i.e., located at 634 km above the planetary radius. Figure   shows that 99% of the absorption at is produced by the upper (=634–4243) atmospheric layers that intersect the line of sight (e.g., the dashed circle in Fig.  ). In this absorbing atmospheric shell with a width of 3,609 km the total Hydrogen number density and temperature ranges are – cm and 1870–7004 K, respectively (Fig.  ). The physical properties of the atmospheric layers that contribute to the bulk of the X-ray absorption are constrained by the optical measurements of .  Assuming that adding metals in the atmosphere would not change dramatically the density-temperature profile (see, however, the discussion in ), we estimate that increases from 1.008 to 1.059  (or equivalently from 0.156 to 0.164 ) when the neutral metals increase from zero to ten times the solar metallicity (Fig.  ).

These two minimums occur slightly before and after the second and third contacts, respectively, with a depth here of exactly (dashed line in Fig.  ).

    <outline text="Impact of the broad energy-band on the observed transmitted flux" _note="Due to the limited sensitivity of the current X-ray facilities, any tentative detection of planetary transits must use light curves in a broad energy band to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The extension and depth of the coronal transit is modified by the variations with energy of the coronal emission profile, the photon extinction cross-section (determining the absorption radius), and the observed stellar flux. It is therefore important to assess in a broad energy band the effective transit. This effective transit is the weighted average of the monoenergetic transit on the broad energy-band, using the observed X-ray count rate versus energy (i.e., the observed X-ray spectrum; top panel of Fig.  ) as weight.  For a given metallicity, we compute at each grid energy the coronal profile and the absorption radius, and the corresponding light curve of the coronal transit. The top panel of Fig.   shows the absorption radius decreasing with the energy, with local jump associated to the ionization edges of metals. When there is no metals, the X-ray absorption radius becomes lower than the planetary radius –the lower boundary of ’s simulation– at energies larger than 1.1 keV. Therefore, the optical depth used to compute the absorption factor in Eq.   has also to be estimated inside the lower atmosphere, which requires an extension of the density model as we did in Sect.  . This leads for comparison at to .  The mid and bottom panels of Fig.   show the maximum depth of the coronal transit and its temporal shift from the transit center, respectively, vs. energy. Both values are mainly correlated with the warm-to-cool plasma emissivity ratio (Fig.  ) that controls the extension of the corona.  Then, we compute the weighted average light curve of the coronal transit in the 0.25–2 keV energy band for XMM-Newton/pn using the template instrumental spectrum of HD 189733A as weight (Fig.  ). We obtain maximum transit depths of 1.62%, 1.67%, and 1.82%, for no metals, and one and ten times solar metallicity (no metallic ions), respectively, at corresponding to a temporal shift of 47.4 min from the transit center; at the transit center the depth is reduced to 0.61%, 0.64%, and 0.72%, respectively.  Therefore, the maximum transit depth in the 0.25–2 keV energy band is little sensitive to the metal abundance. Moreover, the transit light curve at 0.7 keV (grey line in Fig.  ) is a correct approximation of the transit light curve in the 0.25–2 keV energy band.">

  <outline text="Monte Carlo radiative transfer" _note="To simulate the transit of HD 189733b in front of its host star, we used the radiative transfer code [stokes]{}. Originally written for polarimetric investigations of active galactic nuclei, [stokes]{} has been extended over the last years to cover a much larger panel of astrophysical sources (a detailed list of examples can be found in ). The code and its characteristics are extensively described in , and for the optical/UV part, and in for the X-ray band, so we will simply summarize the principal aspects of [stokes]{} relevant for our computations.  The code can handle a large panel of emitting, scattering and/or absorbing geometries in a fully three-dimensional environment. Multiple scattering enables the code to radiatively couple all the different regions of a given model, and a web of virtual detectors arranged in a spherical geometry is used to record the photon wavelength, intensity, and polarization state, according to the Stokes formalism (). About 10 photons have been sampled for our analysis. The total intensity (flux), polarization degree (= ), and polarization angle (= ) are computed by averaging all the detected photons, at each line-of-sight in polar and azimuthal directions. Mie, Rayleigh, Thomson, Compton and inverse Compton scattering are included from the near-infrared to hard X-ray bands.  For planetary atmospheres in the X-ray domain, Rayleigh and Compton scattering of photons onto bound electrons will be the major mechanism to alter the net polarization, and a visual representation of the integrated and differential scattering cross sections produced by [stokes]{} is presented in Fig.  . Note that for molecular hydrogen the incoherent scattering cross-section is two-times larger than for atomic hydrogen .  Photo-ionization and recombination effects, which also influence the resulting polarization by absorption and unpolarized re-emission processes, are based on quantum mechanics computations from and . We use fluorescent yields and energy of the subsequently re-emitted Auger photons from the Opacity Project , and X-ray photoelectric cross-sections and inner-shell edge energies of . Finally, we opt for elemental abundances from and ten times solar metallicity to allow direct comparison with .  Since the X-ray scattering by dust grains is not yet implemented in [stokes]{}, we consider only gaseous components. We do not consider additional soft X-ray emission from the exoplanet itself induced by the stellar wind charge exchange mechanism since it was estimated in the case of the close-in exoplanet HD 209458b to be about five orders of magnitude fainter than the emission from the host star .

The exoplanet orbits in front of HD 189733A from orbital phase -0.25 to orbital phase +0.25, with an eclipse of the stellar corona (i.e., a planetary transit) occuring between orbital phases -0.0169 and +0.0169. During this planetary transit, the 0.7 keV flux decreases by 2.000.15 % between the first and second contacts, as the exoplanet starts to cover the X-ray corona, then rises to 1.070.15 % at orbital phase 0. It then decreases back to 2.020.15 % between the third and fourth contacts before resuming to the non-eclipsed flux, showing no more variation during the remainder of the orbit of HD 189733b. A close up representation of the transit is shown in Fig.   for clarity purposes. We find a perfect agreement between numerical and simulation results within the Monte-Carlo statistical error of our modeling.  Using the [stokes]{} code, we isolated photons that are re-emitted/scattered from HD 189733b, and plotted the resulting light curve (normalized with respect to the unitary flux of HD 189733A) in Fig   (second panel from the top). To increase the statistics of the photon-starved results, the phase resolution of the re-emitted/scattered radiation has been decreased compared to Fig.  . Due to the strong photoelectric absorption processes that prevail at soft X-ray energies, the X-ray flux from the exoplanet is found to be three to five orders of magnitude lower than the photon flux from the main star. From the HD 189733A flux of  erg cm s at 0.7 keV, the flux of HD 189733b is about –  erg cm s, depending on the orbital phase of the planet. The flux reprocessed onto the atmospheric layers of HD 189733b strongly depends on the angle between the source, the exoplanet atmosphere and the observer; this effect is due to the differential scattering phase function of incoherent scattering, as presented in Fig.   (bottom). In the case of Rayleigh scattering, forward and backward reprocessing prevails while, for incoherent scattering onto bound electrons, forward and perpendicular scattering are less probable. However, backscattering is very strong and when the gaseous planet passes beyond the plane-of-the-sky, its reprocessed flux rises up to a normalized flux of  4.7 10. Then, HD 189733b disappears behind its star and flux drops to zero.">

  <outline text="Polarization" _note="The middle panel of Fig   is a visualization of the linear continuum polarization degree , ranging from 0 (unpolarized) to 100 % (fully polarized). It is the polarization resulting from scattered light only, i.e. not diluted by the unpolarized stellar flux. The shape of the polarization curve is very similar to the results obtained by , who evaluated the spectra of visible to near-infrared starlight reflected by Jupiter-like extrasolar planets. As , we find polarization maximums close to orbital phases , i.e., near planetary greatest elongations, with = 64.92.9 % which is slightly larger than in infrared. Since the planet’s orbital plane is inclined by 4, the polarization degree does not drop to zero at zero orbital phase as a small fraction of photons scatters onto the top of the atmospheric layers towards the Earth. Hence, we are sure that our model produces correct results and extends the near-infrared/optical investigation of to X-ray energies.  The fourth panel of Fig   also shows the star+planet linear polarization, now taking into account polarization dilution by the unpolarized stellar photons, i.e., . The overall shape of the polarization curve, associated with a polarization degree below 0.003 %, is quite different from the intrinsic . In fact, maximum polarization is found when the exoplanet transits behind the plane-of-the-sky, with a local diminution to zero when HD 189733b is occulted by its primary star. The departure from a purely sinusoidal waveform is again due to the scattering phase function of incoherent scattering that promotes backscattering. Associated with maximum fluxes from HD 189733b that are not located at maximal planetary elongations, the net diluted polarization degree peaks at orbital phases +0.35 and +0.65. The highest degrees of are of the order of 0.0025  0.0002 % at 0.7 keV, similarly to the polarization found in the optical band .  Finally, the bottom panel of Fig   presents the absolute polarization position angle to be observed with an X-ray polarimeter. When HD 189733b does not transit on HD 189733A, its polarization angle is equal to 90 (the -vector of the radiation is aligned with the projected rotational axis of the orbit). However, when the planet is about to transit in front of its primary star, oscillates around 90. The canceling contribution of unpolarized fluxes from the star and the 90 oriented polarization position angle resulting from scattering prevent the value from stabilizing, resulting in a chaotic signal. This behavior is strengthened due to the edge-on orientation of the exoplanet’s orbit. As the illuminated side of HD 189733b, producing the scattering-induced polarization signal, is facing the star, an observer situated on Earth no longer detects the bright side of the atmosphere and the signal is almost canceled. Only photons that have scattered on the top of the atmosphere carry a non-random polarization signal. Since most of the radiation comes from HD 189733A, the resulting polarization signal is highly diluted and thus randomly oscillates.  Another variation of is detected when the planet passes behind HD 189733A: at the ingress (egress) point, the polarization position angle increases (decreases) by  30, due to the partial obscuration of the reprocessing target. The inclination of the system and the partial obscuration of the planetary disk suppresses the averaging of polarization and results in variations before a pure cancellation of polarization due to the planet disappearance. The amplitude of the fluctuation of is directly correlated with the orbital inclination of the exoplanet and could be, in principle, used to estimate the impact parameter of the transit.">

<outline text="Is direct detection of the exoplanet in X-rays possible?" _note="We presented the first quantification of the amount of X-ray flux reprocessed by the Hot Jupiter exoplanet HD 189733b, along with the first estimation of the net polarization a future X-ray polarimeter could detect.">
  <outline text="Scattered X-ray flux" _note="We find that the 0.7 keV flux of HD 189733b is three to five orders of magnitude lower than its primary main sequence K1.5 V star, depending on the orbital phase of the exoplanet. Considering a stellar flux of 2.910erg cm s at 0.7 keV and at a distance of 19.45 pc, it implies that the reprocessed flux from HD 189733b is lower than 1.010erg cm s at best before ingress and after egress.  Since the planetary emission cannot be spatially resolved from the stellar emission in X-rays (angular separation lower than  mas), one can only look for flux modulation with orbital phase. As a guideline, we can use a threshold of the planetary relative flux, , to divide the X-ray observation of planetary orbits (of period in seconds) in two parts. During the orbital phase , where is lower than , the X-ray count rate of HD 189733 is with the count rate of the host star and the average planetary relative flux on . During the orbital phase , where is larger than , the X-ray count rate of HD 189733 is , with the average increase of the relative planetary flux. The increase of count rate is statistically significant if with and assuming Poisson noise . Straightforward algebra leads to:  Using  pn count s (Sect.  ), we find a minimum value of orbits for , , and . Since the needed accuracy requires a total exposure time of 81 years, the modulation of the X-ray flux with the orbital phase cannot be observed.">

  <outline text="X-ray polarization" _note="Fig.   shows that the continuum polarization degree resulting from the interaction of stellar photons with the inner layers of the HD 189733b’s atmosphere is very low, ranging from 0 to 0.003 %. Due to strong dilution by the unpolarized primary source, this level of polarization corresponds to an amplitude of  10. Coupled to a low X-ray luminosity, such degree of polarization is, by any standard, by far too low to be detected with the current generation of X-ray polarimeters. Such statement includes the Gas Pixel Detector technology , Time Projection Chamber polarimeter concepts , and polarimeters based on Bragg diffraction and Thomson scattering . Note that most of those polarimeter concepts are also limited to energies higher than 0.7 keV.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="In this paper, we adopted the ’s model of the atmosphere of HD 189733b to run a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code to estimate the amount of X-ray photons emitted from the corona of HD 189733A reprocessed on this Hot-Jupiter like exoplanet. We obtained the predictive X-ray transit light curve of HD 189733A and quantified the flux and polarization emerging from scattering onto the atmospheric layers.  We have found that the maximum depth of the planetary transit on the geometrically thick and optically thin corona of HD 189733A in the 0.25–2 keV energy band is 1.7%. With the assumption that adding metals in the atmosphere would not change dramatically the density-temperature profile, we have estimated that the maximum transit depth is little sensitive to the metal abundance. Since the maximum depth of the X-ray transit of HD 189733b estimated from the current modeling of its atmosphere is small, forthcoming deeper observations with the current X-ray observatories may not have the required X-ray sensitivity to accurately constrain the transit shape. The next generation of large X-ray mission from the ESA, Athena, thanks to its larger mirror area (e.g., the proposed Athena+ mission had at 1 keV a mirror area about 14 times larger than the FM2-pn mirror of XMM-Newton; ) should allow deeper investigations of the X-ray planetary transits of HD 189733A .  We have quantified the amount of flux reprocessed onto the Hot Jupiter surface. The exoplanet’s flux is three to five orders of magnitude fainter than its primary star, with maximums at egress and ingress points due to the asymmetrical scattering phase function of Compton and Rayleigh scattering. At most, the reprocessed flux is lower than 1.010erg cm s. A detection of the flux modulation with orbital phase is in pratical not achievable since requiring tremendous exposure time.  The reprocessed flux is associated with a very weak, diluted, amount of linear polarization. The polarization degree being less than to 0.003 %, it is impossible to measure it with the current technology of X-ray polarimeters.  However, the direct detection of the X-rays scattered by HD 189733b might be considered in the future with the possible advent of interferometric facilities in X-rays, e.g., THE BLACK HOLE MAPPER visionary-mission with (sub)microarcsecond resolution (see NASA ASTROPHYSICS IN THE NEXT THREE DECADES, ).
