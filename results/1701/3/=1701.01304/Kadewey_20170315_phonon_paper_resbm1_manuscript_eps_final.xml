    <title>Demonstrating the decoupling regime of the electron-phonon interaction
in a quantum dot using chirped optical excitation</title>
    <abstract>Excitation of a semiconductor quantum dot with a chirped laser pulse
allows excitons to be created by rapid adiabatic passage. In quantum
dots this process can be greatly hindered by the coupling to phonons.
Here we add a high chirp rate to ultra-short laser pulses and use these
pulses to excite a single quantum dot. We demonstrate that we enter a
regime where the exciton-phonon coupling is effective for small pulse
areas, while for higher pulse areas a decoupling of the exciton from the
phonons occurs. We thus discover a reappearance of rapid adiabatic
passage, in analogy to the predicted reappearance of Rabi rotations at
high pulse areas. The measured results are in good agreement with
theoretical calculations. </abstract>
