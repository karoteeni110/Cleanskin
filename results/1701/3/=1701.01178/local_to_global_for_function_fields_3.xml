    <title>A local to global principle for densities over function fields</title>
    <abstract>Let be a positive integer and be an integrally closed subring of a
global function field . The purpose of this paper is to provide a
general sieve method to compute densities of subsets of defined by local
conditions. The main advantage of the method relies on the fact that one
can use results from measure theory to extract density results over .
Using this method we are able to compute the density of the set of
polynomials with coefficients in which give rise to “good” totally
ramified extensions of the global function field . As another
application, we give a closed expression for the density of rectangular
unimodular matrices with coefficients in in terms of the -polynomial of
the function field. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="In B. Poonen and M. Stoll formalise a nice sieve method for computing densities using -adic analysis. Essentially, the method consists of writing a given set in terms of local conditions at the completions of ; once this is done, the density of can be computed by determining the measures of certain sets which are associated to the local conditions which define . It is worth mentioning that the result is a powerful evolution of Ekedhal’s Sieve (See ).  In this paper we present the extension of this method to global function fields i.e. univariate function fields over finite fields. Let be a non-trivial integrally closed subring of a function field and be the set of places of where all the functions in are well defined. It is well known (see for example ) that consists exactly of the intersection of all the valuation rings of for . Vice versa, it also holds that an arbitrary intersection of valuation rings of is an integrally closed subring ). We will be interested in computing the density of a subset of .  Before doing so, we first need to specify what we mean by “density” of in the function field context. Over the set of rational integers , the density of a subset is computed by considering the sequence of ratios between the number of points of falling in the hypercube of side and centred at the origin, and . If is this sequence of ratios and is its limit (if exists), then we say that has density . In the case of , we explain how to use Moore-Smith convergence to define a notion of limit over the directed set of positive divisors having support in the complement of (see also ). Once this is understood, Riemann-Roch spaces of positive divisors having support in the complement of will play the role of intervals, and therefore products of such spaces will play the role of hypercubes.  Let be the set of positive divisors having support in the complement of . The striking analogy between and which allows our density definition (see Subsection  ) is given by In particular the reader should notice that the definition of density we will provide is consistent with the one used in the literature in the case of : if , and is the place at plus infinity with respect to , we have that and therefore which induces the natural definition of density in the context of .  The essence of the presented method (Theorem  ) is to polarize the difficulty of the problem: in fact, on one hand the -adic formalism allows to easily compute a “candidate” for the density of a certain subset of by using tools from measure theory, on the other hand all the difficulty of the problem is unloaded on proving that the limit of a certain sequence (given by Equation ) tends to zero. In particular, we show that whenever the local conditions are actually related in a certain way to polynomial equations, the limit can be proven to be always zero (Theorem  ).  The entire machinery we build in Section   is then used to produce two new results in Sections   and  .  In Section   we compute the probability that a “random” polynomial of fixed degree with coefficient in an given integrally closed subring gives rise to a totally ramified extension of for which the equation is “good enough” around the totally ramified place (in terms of Definition  ).  Let be positive integers such that and be a domain. The question whether a homomorphism of in can be extended to an automorphism of raised many interesting questions in the past (see for instance Serre’s Conjecture, which is proven in ). In Section   we close the problem of computing the density of homomorphisms of in which can be extended to automorphims of . In the case of , these homomorphisms arise from context of convolutional codes (see for example or ) and their density was studied in and . In Theorem   we show that the density of unimodular matrices over is a rational number and can be explicitly computed as soon as the complement of the holomorphy set is finite.">
  <outline text="Preliminary definitions and notations" _note="Let be a finite field. In this paper all the function fields are global and have full constant field . We denote by a valuation ring of function field , having maximal ideal . The set of all the places of will be denoted by . If is a proper subset of , we denote by the subset of places of of degree greater than . Moreover, we write to denote the HOLOMORPHY RING OF i.e. the intersection of all the valuation rings associated to the places of : Sometimes, we will refer to as the HOLOMORPHY SET of and to as the HOLOMORPHY RING of . Holomorphy rings are integrally closed in and any integrally closed subring of is an holomorphy ring . In the whole paper we consider only holomorphy rings whose holomorphy set has finite complement in the set of all places of . The most immediate example of holomorphy ring is as this consists of the intersection of all the valuation rings of different from the valuation ring at infinity.  Let be the set of divisors of i.e. the free abelian group having as base symbols the elements in the set . For , we denote by the finite subset of for which is non-zero. Moreover, we will write whenever for any in . Let Let be the subset of divisors of having support over the complement of in . As is a directed set, we can define via Moore-Smith Convergence (see and more specifically for this context ) a notion of limit over . In this context, we can give an upper density definition for a subset of as follows: where is the Riemann-Roch space attached to the divisor and . Analogously, one can give a notion of lower density by considering the inferior limit of the sequence. Whenever these two quantities are equal, we say that a subset of has a well-defined density .  For a valuation ring let us denote by the completion of with respect to the -adic metric. In addition, let us denote by the normalized Haar measure on with respect to the -adic metric. For a subset we denote by the boundary of with respect to the topology induced by the -adic metric. For a multivariate polynomial , we will denote by (resp. ) the degree of in the variable (resp. the degree of the homogenization of ).

<outline text="The local to global principle for densities over global function fields" _note="In this section we describe the local to global principle which will be used later on. This result is the function field analogue of .    Let be a positive integer, be a subset of places of and the holomorphy ring of . For any , let be a measurable set such that . Suppose that Let defined by . Then   is convergent.  Let . Then exists and defines a measure on .   is concentrated at finite subsets of . In addition, if is finite we have:  Throughout the proof will be fixed, so we will denote by . What we need to do is to translate the proof of to the context of function fields. Essentially, we need to understand how the measure of -adic intervals can be translated into density via the use of Riemann-Roch Theorem . Once this is done, the same arguments of the proof of will apply to this context. We define a -INTERVAL in as the set for some and . A -BOX will just be a product of -intervals: To simplify notation, we say that a -box is a -CUBE if it has the form for some and . In other words, is the cartesian product of intervals of equal length. We say that is the CENTER of the cube. Let be a finite subset of . Let us now compute the density of the elements in which are mapped in a product of a finite number of -boxes via the natural embedding . Let be such product of -boxes. For any , the -box can be covered with a finite number of disjoint cubes of equal size , as all the congruences can be decomposed in terms of the finest congruence, given by . Therefore, one can write with independently of .  We consider the diagram where , the map is the natural inclusion, and is the isomorphism (coming from the Chinese Remainder Theorem) which makes the diagram commutative. On the right-hand side, we can immediately compute the product measure of by looking at its definition, getting . It remains to show that the density of is indeed . For this, let us decompose . Let be a finite set indexing the cubes which cover and let . Any given determines a choice of cubes as follows: for each place we select exactly one cube , having center . We now build a as the product . Clearly, the set of ’s built in this way has cardinality and covers via a disjoint union. If we can now prove that the density of is independent of the choice of , then we will have that To achieve this, we now explicitly compute the value . As the diagram above is commutative, we can equivalently compute the density of elements of falling into via the map . Let . Notice that we have Observe that for any divisor , the map restricted to is -linear. Let be the genus of . Therefore if we denote by the -th component of , we have which for of large degree, equals by Riemann-Roch Theorem. We can finally compute the density of elements mapping in the cube (which is in fact independent of , as we wanted): Using now Equation we get the final claim by comparing with . Since now we have proved the theorem for boxes, all the arguments of the proof of are now straightforward to apply. In fact, suppose for a moment that the set of ’s in for which is different from the empty set is a finite set . Now, let be a finite set of places. Assuming that , one can cover each of the ’s from the interior (resp. ) with a finite set of boxes which well approximate the measure (resp. ). In particular one has where the products above are both finite and union of the boxes for each , where the theorem holds. As we can apply the symmetric argument with a set of external approximations we have from which the claim follows by letting the approximation get sharper and then and tend to .  On the other hand, if is an infinite set, one easily sees that an approximation with finitely many is good enough, as long as condition is verified. To see this, let be a finite subset of and let us recall that is the set of places of of degree larger than and then is the subset of consisting of places of degree less than or equal to . Observe that for a positive integer such that contains we can define a partial approximation of Notice that contains so . In addition we have that Now, by letting go to infinity and using condition on one gets the claim.  The next Theorem ensures that when the can be expressed in terms of polynomial equations, Condition is always verified, similarly to what happens in the case of Ekedhal Sieve for integers .    Let be a global function field and be a subset of with finite complement. Let be the holomorphy ring of . Let be coprime polynomials. Then  If there is nothing to prove so we can suppose . Without loss of generality, we can also suppose . Since will be fixed throughout the proof, we will denote and by and respectively. Let us recall that the places in are in natural correspondence with the prime ideals of , therefore with a small abuse of terminology we will identify this two sets. We first fix large enough, so that for any of degree larger than . Now fix large enough so that . Let us also introduce new notation to simplify the computations. For a divisor , let us define Our first purpose is to estimate for and large. First, we notice a simple upper bound for : We now want to estimate the sum above for different regimes of and . In order to do so, let us further split the sum as  Let us estimate ([ ]{}). First, we want to give a reasonable estimate for in the specified regime. Notice that for each point of satisfying there are at most preimages of in , as the evaluation map is linear and has kernel . Let be the number of -points of the variety defined by and when reduced modulo . Let be the genus of . By observing that and that we get:  As can be chosen large enough to avoid the places of bad reduction, we can estimate classically as for some constant . It follows that for some other constant .  Let us estimate ([ ]{}). Let be the ideal generated by in and let . Since has codimension , is principal. Let be the generator of , which can be chosen with coefficients over by multiplying by an appropriate element in . Let us also assume without loss of generality that . Let now be so large that modulo every prime of degree larger than , we have . Consider now all the elements of ending with a fixed and for which . Let us estimate their contribution to each in the sum ([ ]{}). Let be the product of all the prime ideals of such that and for which there exists such that (this set is finite as ). If we denote by the number of distinct primes appearing in the factorization of , the contribution of all the -tuples ending with is bounded by . By the definition of , it is clear that . If we denote by the projection of in , we have that Therefore this in turn implies that satisfies . Now, the key observation to get the final estimate for ([ ]{}) is the following: was chosen large in such a way that the homogeneous degree of is constant modulo for any of degree larger than . Recall now that every prime ideal appearing in the factorization of has degree larger than , therefore where the constant depends on the leading coefficients of (and independent of ), from which it follows that , for large enough.  The reader should now notice that in ([ ]{}), an element in ending with (i.e. of the form ), cannot contribute more than for each , as the evaluation map is an injection to . It follows easily that the set of all the -tuples ending with contribute at most to the whole sum ([ ]{}). Now, using the observations above and recalling that we also have to take into account the size of the set of the -tuples such that for , we finally get  At this point we observe that the estimates of ([ ]{}) and ([ ]{}) only hold for large values of and , so it is now important to notice how the order of the limits in is actually taken into account: in order for estimate ([ ]{}) to hold, it is enough to choose so large that the primes of bad reduction are avoided. For estimate ([ ]{}), take so large that  its degree is larger than ,  the homogeneous degree of is constant with respect to all places of of degree larger than ,  the degree of with respect to is constant for all places of of degree larger than .  We can now safely use the two estimates to complete the proof: This completes the proof, since the sum above is the tail of a subseries of the zeta function of evaluated at , which is converging.  The reader should notice that the counting technique using in the estimate of (II) is similar to the one used in the case of in the main result of .">

To see this, simply combine and .    Let be a perfect field and be an irreducible separable polynomial of degree over a function field . Let and be a totally ramified extension of places of .

Suppose , then there exists such that . Let . The minimal polynomial of is , which implies that if we can prove that , it will follow that is Eisenstein with respect to . It is easily seen that , therefore if is a uniformizer for , we can write for some . Whence, Since , we get , which forces , as .  Now suppose that is Eisenstein with respect to some . It follows that is a uniformizer for , which implies .  The claim (ii) easily follows by applying (i) to with .  The following corollary shows that the polynomials which are Eisenstein after a Moebius transformation are not more than the ones which are Eisenstein after either a shift or an inversion.

We are now ready to extract the density of the set the set of polynomials in question using the local to global principle together with some tools from measure theory and linear algebra. With a small abuse of notation, in what follow we will identify with the set of degree polynomials over a holomorphy ring .    Let be a holomorphy ring of a global function field having full constant field . The set of polynomials of degree such that the ring is a field and is nicely totally ramified with respect to , has density  First, we should observe that we can restrict to the separable case, as the set of inseparable polynomials has density zero. Let us denote the complement of in by . First, we should prove that if ramification occurs, it occurs with probability one at a place of . In fact, the polynomials defining a totally ramified extension at a place of , do not contribute to . This is not surprising, as the definition of the density depends on the choice of .

First, we show that if , then for some . Clearly, if this follows immediately by the definition of Eisenstein polynomial. Let now suppose that . Let and such that is Eisenstein.

As is diagonal, one can obtain the measures of each of its component and then compute the product in order to get the wanted result. These measures are indeed easy to compute and It follows that END OF THE PROOF OF CLAIM 2\ Clearly, we have an embedding of into . Using this embedding and Proposition   we have that the polynomial defines a nicely totally ramified extension of at if and only if . In fact, if defines a nicely totally ramified extension then we are in one of the two cases of Proposition  , as either or for some totally ramified, which implies that either for some or . Vice versa, suppose that , then is Eisenstein for some or is Eisenstein. This implies that the extension is totally ramified by Lemma  , as . We have now to show that the total ramification is nice.

By recalling the definition of the linear operator , and by considering only the conditions on the coefficients of the terms of degree and , it is easy to observe that As and are indeed coprime polynomials, by Theorem  .  It remains to show that . We now produce two equations associated to via elementary elimination theory, the final claim will follow again by Theorem  . Let us write a generic shift for a generic polynomial of degree : for some polynomial functions .

Recall that we want to apply Theorem   so we have to eliminate the variable , getting two equations. In order to do that, we have to distinguish two possibilities, depending on whether the characteristic of divides or not. In case is divisible by , then two polynomials which eliminate are and . Define . By Theorem   we get that . Observe that by construction , from which the claim follows.  It remains to deal with the case in which is not divisible by . We can eliminate the variable from the ideal by multiplying by and by and using the relation given by , getting two polynomials:  We define now as the set of specializations such that for some place of degree larger than . It remains to show that and are coprime, then we will get by Theorem  . First, observe that as (since ). Notice that for some . On the other hand, does not appear in , which implies that, if there is an irreducible common factor of and , then it must divide both and . In our specific case case, which forces but this is impossible, as for example .  END OF THE PROOF OF CLAIM 3\ We are now able to conclude the proof using Theorem  . Let be the set of degree polynomials giving rise to a nice totally ramified extension and let us consider . By looking at the definition of the map in the Theorem   and by recalling the choice of the ’s, we have that . Therefore, since Condition of Theorem   is verified by the previous claim, we have that from which the claim follow by Claim 2 and the fact that .  In the proof of the previous result the restriction is crucial only for the proof of Claim 3. In the following remark we briefly adapt the above strategy to the case .  For the sake of completeness we should also deal with the case . Let be the set of separable irreducible degree polynomials for which the extension is nicely totally ramified. For this, let be the set of places of of degree at most . For , let be defined as in the proof of Theorem   and for let . For any fixed , one easily observes that therefore Now, for any fixed , Condition is verified, since the set of is finite. Using Theorem   as before one gets that the density of is which is now a finite product. Letting go to plus infinity, the sequence converges to zero, which forces and so .  The reader should notice that the condition on the fact that the total ramification is good is of fundamental importance in the proof of the result: in fact, it allows the conversion given by Proposition  . It would be of great interest to understand what happens to the final density result of Theorem   when the condition in Definition   is removed.">

As a special case of the main result, we also get the density of such matrices with entries the ring . Such matrices are of deep interest in coding theory since they are one of the key ingredients to define a convolutional code. In that context a rectangular unimodular matrix is usually said to be LEFT PRIME, see for example for a characterization of such condition.  Let be positive integers such that . Let be a matrix having entries in a commutative ring . We say that is RECTANGULAR UNIMODULAR if it can be extended with rows in to an element of .  The reader should notice that in the definition above we require the extension of to be an automorphism of as an -module.  What is the density of rectangular unimodular matrices of ?  The problem was first addressed in in the case of . Unfortunately, the proof in is not correct as a priori there is no reason for the infinite sum in the proof of to commute with the superior limit. This was also observed in , where it is present a partial fix of the issue, in the case in which the number of columns are at least the double of the number of rows. In what follows we provide the complete solution of the problem using the tools we developed in the first section for the general case of holomorphy rings. In order to do this, we have to construct the -adic system of subsets used in Theorem  . This can be done using the following result proved in .    Let be a Dedekind domain. Let be a matrix with entries in and be the ideal generated by the determinants of the maximal minors of . Then is rectangular unimodular if and only if .  We are now able to state and prove the main theorem    Let be a function field with full constant field . Let be a set of places in having finite complement. The density of of the set of rectangular unimodular matrices with entries in is where is the zeta function of defined as and is the holomorphy set of .  For any , let be the set of non-unimodular matrices in , i.e. the set of matrices for which the ideal generated by the determinant of the maximal minors is contained in . By Theorem   we have that a matrix is in if and only if for any . Therefore, in the notation of Theorem   it follows that and then, if the system verifies condition we have that  In the polynomial ring let us consider the matrix whose entry is the variable . Let , be two distinct minors of this matrix and and be the determinants of and respectively. Notice that and are distinct irreducible polynomials, therefore coprime. It is straightforward observe that the set is contained in . By applying Theorem   one gets that the condition   is verified.  It remains to compute the -measure of the , the claim will follow by Proposition   and the fact that . In order to compute such measures, we first decompose . Let be a representative in for a matrix in which is not full rank. We observe that the set is contained in . In addition, if and satisfy , then . Let be a set of representatives for the non-full rank matrices of . Therefore, for fixed the union of such is disjoint and covers the whole , from which it follows that Since and the number of non-full rank matrices in is one gets that Therefore, by applying Theorem   we get . Exchanging now the finite product with the product over all the places, we get which is the result we wanted.  Notice that the density can be explicitly computed by the closed expression of the zeta function and the fact that is finite. Observe that this is consistent with the result obtained for unimodular rows in the general case of global fields .  As an immediate corollary we have  Let be positive integers. The density of the set of rectangular unimodular matrices (i.e. left prime matrices) with coefficients in is  Let be the rational function field and be the place at infinity of . Recall that the zeta function of the rational function field is Previously we already observed that and therefore it follows that . The claim follows by applying directly Theorem  .  An analogous result in the case of can be found in .
