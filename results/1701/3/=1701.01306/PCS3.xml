    <title>Parabolic conformally symplectic structures III;\
Invariant Differential operators and complexes</title>
    <abstract>This is the last part of a series of articles on a family of geometric
structures (PACS–structures) which all have an underlying almost
conformally symplectic structure. While the first part of the series was
devoted to the general study of these structures, the second part
focused on the case that the underlying structure is conformally
symplectic (PCS–structures). In that case, we obtained a close relation
to parabolic contact structures via a concept of parabolic
contactification. It was also shown that special symplectic connections
(and thus all connections of exotic symplectic holonomy) arise as the
canonical connection of such a structure.

In this last part, we use parabolic contactifications and constructions
related to Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand (BGG) sequences for parabolic
contact structures, to construct sequences of differential operators
naturally associated to a PCS–structure. In particular, this gives rise
to a large family of complexes of differential operators associated to a
special symplectic connection. In some cases, large families of
complexes for more general instances of PCS–structures are obtained. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="This article is the last part in a series of three which aims at constructing a large family of differential complexes naturally associated to certain geometric structures. These structures are associated to certain parabolic subalgebras in simple Lie algebras and they come with an underlying almost conformally symplectic structure, so we call them PARABOLIC ALMOST CONFORMALLY SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES or PACS–structures for short. The precise definition of these structures was given in the first part of the series, where we also showed that any such structure gives rise to a canonical connection on the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold. Hence the torsion and the curvature of this canonical connection are natural invariants of a PACS–structure. The torsion naturally splits into two components, one of which is exactly the obstruction to the underlying structure being conformally symplectic. If this obstruction vanishes, the structure is called a PCS–structure, and if the remaining component of torsion also vanishes, one talks about a torsion–free PCS–structure.  Using the classification of simple Lie algebras, one can give an explicit description of the PACS–structures. In it was shown that, on the one hand, these structures provide natural extensions of several well known and interesting geometries. For example, for any Kähler metric, the Kähler form and the complex structure define a torsion–free PCS–structure corresponding to the simple Lie algebra . Indeed, torsion–free PCS–structures of this type are equivalent to Kähler metrics. Allowing torsion for the PCS–structure, one obtains certain more general types of almost Hermitian manifolds, while for PACS–structures of that type, there is no obvious description in terms of Hermitian metrics. Things work similarly in indefinite signatures and for para–Hermitian metrics. Another type of PCS–structure is closely related to almost quaternionic manifolds endowed with a conformally symplectic structure that is Hermitian in the quaternionic sense.  On the other hand, there is a close relation between PCS–structures and special symplectic connections in the sense of . Indeed any special symplectic connection turns out to be the canonical connection of a torsion–free PCS–structure, so in particular, this applies to all connections of exotic symplectic holonomy. There is a nice characterization of the PCS–structures whose canonical connection is special symplectic using local parabolic contactifications (see below), which is crucial for the developments in this article.  The algebraic data which determine a type of PACS–structures at the same time determine another geometric structure in one higher dimension. Any of these structures comes with an underlying contact structure and they are called PARABOLIC CONTACT STRUCTURES, see the discussion in Section 4.2 of . Now on a contact manifold, the Reeb field of any contact form defines a TRANSVERSAL INFINITESIMAL AUTOMORPHISM of the contact structure. In particular it gives rise to a one–dimensional foliation and any local space of leaves for this foliation naturally inherits a conformally symplectic structure. As discussed in , any conformally symplectic structure can be locally realized in this way (“local contactification”) and this realization is unique up to local contactomorphism.  For parabolic contact structures, transversal infinitesimal automorphisms are much more rare (and don’t exist generically). Still, as shown in the second part of this series there is a perfect analog of these constructions in the setting of parabolic contact structures and PCS–structures. For any transversal infinitesimal automorphism of a parabolic contact structure of any type, a local leaf space naturally inherits a PCS–structure of the corresponding type (“PCS–quotients”). Locally, any PCS–structure can be realized in this way (“parabolic contactification”) and this realization is unique up to local isomorphism (of parabolic contact structures). So one can view PCS–structures as geometric structures characterizing reductions of parabolic contact structures by a transversal infinitesimal symmetry.  In the language of parabolic contactifications, one can also deal with geometries corresponding to Lie algebras of type (which are excluded in ), see Section 3 of . Here the parabolic contact structure is a CONTACT PROJECTIVE STRUCTURE (see ) with vanishing contact torsion, while the analog of a PCS–structure is a conformally Fedosov structure as introduced in (with slight modifications). Finally, in all cases, the PCS–structures for which the distinguished connection is special symplectic (which in the conformally Fedosov case means that it is of Ricci–type) are exactly those, for which any local parabolic contactification is locally isomorphic to the homogeneous model. This gives a conceptual explanation for the construction for special symplectic connections found in .  As stated above, this last part of the series aims at constructing differential complexes, which are naturally associated to special symplectic connections or more general PCS–structures. The original motivation for the series were the differential complexes on constructed in and applied to problems in integral geometry there. In that construction, it was not clear what kind of geometric structure on is “responsible” for the existence of the complexes. A surprising feature is that these complexes are one step longer than the de–Rham complex, which suggests that they have their origin in one higher dimension. The simplest instance of such a complex is the so–called co–effective complex on a conformally symplectic manifold, which looks like the Rumin complex associated to a contact structure in one higher dimension. Indeed, as a “proof of concept” for the current series, it was shown in that the co–effective complex can be constructed from the Rumin complex on local contactifications.  Basically, we carry out a similar procedure in this article, starting from a large family of differential complexes that are naturally associated to parabolic contact structures. These are derived from BGG sequences as introduced in . Standard BGG sequences are complexes only on locally flat geometries, so pushing them down, one obtains sequences of differential operators naturally associated to a PCS–structure, which are complexes provided that the canonical connection of the PCS–structure is special symplectic. For certain geometries, it has been shown in that certain parts of BGG sequences are subcomplexes under weaker assumptions than local flatness. For parabolic contact structures, this only applies in the case of structures of type , so this gives rise to a construction of complexes (of unusual length) for certain PCS–structures of Kähler and para–Kähler type. In the para–Kähler case, one can also start from the relative version of BGG sequences which were constructed in the recent article , and which are complexes under much weaker assumptions than local flatness.  In the situation of the co–effective complex and the Rumin complex, both the construction of the upstairs complex and the procedure of pushing down can be phrased in terms of differential forms. In the general situation of BGG sequences and their variants, one has to deal with differential forms with values in a tractor bundle on the level of parabolic contact structures, and constructing the BGG sequence is much more involved. Therefore, we use a slightly different approach than in . The main observation here is that for a completely reducible natural bundle on a parabolic contact structure (i.e. a bundle induced by a completely reducible representations of the parabolic subgroup) there is an obvious counterpart for PCS–structure of the corresponding type. For a local contactification, there is a rather simple relation between sections upstairs and downstairs, which allows one to directly descend invariant differential operators acting between sections of such bundles. Hence we can directly descend the operators in the BGG sequence to any PCS–quotient, without the need to think about descending tractor bundles or tractor connections. It should be remarked that also an approach via downstairs tractor bundles should be feasible. For the case of conformally Fedosov structures, this has been carried out in the second version of the preprint that has appeared recently.  After a short review of the geometric structure involved and the parabolic version of contactification, the push down procedure for invariant operators acting between sections of completely reducible bundles is described in Section 2; the main results are Theorems   and  . Section 3 discusses the applications of this technique to BGG sequences and the related constructions described above. We describe in detail the complexes associated to connections of Ricci type in Theorem   and those associated to Bochner–bi–Lagrangean metrics in Theorem  . The complexes for para–Kähler manifolds obtained from relative BGG sequences are described in detail in Theorem  . The cases of complexes for Bochner–Kähler metrics (of any signature) coming from BGG sequences and for Kähler metrics coming from subcomplexes in BGG sequences are briefly outlined in Section   and Remark  .  In Section 4, we describe results on the cohomology of the descended version of BGG sequences. This is similar to the results for the co–effective complex in , but this time, the main work is done on the level of the parabolic contact structure. The basic ingredient here is that on that level, the cohomology of a BGG sequence can be described as a twisted de–Rham cohomology. A detailed analysis of the construction of BGG sequences shows that there is a sequence of subsheaves in the upstairs sheaves of tractor–bundle–valued differential forms which computes the cohomology of the descended complex. In Theorem   we construct a long exact sequence involving the cohomology groups of that sheaf. Specializing to the case of the homogeneous model, Theorem   then allows one to interpret this sequence in terms of “downstairs” data. The results are analyzed locally as well as for the global contactification of by the sphere , where we obtain a vast generalization of the results on cohomology needed for the applications in .">

<outline text="Pushing down invariant operators" _note="We first review PCS–structures and their relation to parabolic contact structures. Then we show that each invariant differential operator acting between sections of irreducible natural bundles on the parabolic contact structure descends to a natural differential operator on the corresponding PCS–structure.">
  <outline text="The types of geometric structures" _note="To specify a type of PCS–structure and corresponding parabolic contact structure, we have to choose some algebraic data, see Section 2.1 of for more details. We first need a semisimple Lie group , whose Lie algebra admits a so–called contact grading . Next, we have to choose a parabolic subgroup corresponding to the Lie subalgebra . Then we define a closed subgroup with Lie algebra as consisting of those elements of whose adjoint action preserves the grading of . It turns out that the exponential mapping restricts to a diffeomorphism from onto a closed normal subgroup such that is the semi–direct product of and . In particular, .  By definition, is a Heisenberg algebra, so its Lie bracket defines a non–degenerate line in . This in turn defines the conformally symplectic group . It turns out that for any element , there is a unique linear isomorphism such that defines an automorphism of the graded Lie algebra , so one obtains an isomorphism . By definition, the adjoint action of restricts to an action by automorphisms on the graded Lie algebra , so one obtains a homomorphism which turns out to be infinitesimally injective.  If is not of type , then both geometric structures we need are determined by this homomorphism. In , we have defined the PACS–STRUCTURE associated to as the first order structure on manifolds of dimension determined by the homomorphism . Hence such a structure on a smooth manifold is given by a principal –bundle together with a SOLDERING FORM, a strictly horizontal, –equivariant –valued one–form on the total space of this bundle. Since the image of our homomorphism is contained in , any such structure induces an underlying almost conformally symplectic structure. A PCS–STRUCTURE OF TYPE is then such a first order structure for which this underlying structure is conformally symplectic.  On the other hand, for a contact manifold of dimension , one considers the associated graded to the tangent bundle, which has a natural frame bundle with structure group . A PARABOLIC CONTACT STRUCTURE OF TYPE is then given by a reduction of structure group of this frame bundles corresponding to the homomorphism , respectively by the canonical Cartan geometry that such a reduction determines, see Section 4.2 of .  If is of type , then it turns out that the homomorphism induces an isomorphism between the Lie algebras of the two groups. Thus reductions of structure group as considered above carry very little information. Nonetheless, there are analogs for both types of geometries in the –case. On the parabolic contact side, these are CONTACT PROJECTIVE STRUCTURES (with vanishing contact torsion) as discussed in and in Section 4.2.6 of . On the conformally symplectic side, these are the CONFORMALLY FEDOSOV STRUCTURES discussed in Section 3 of based on the earlier treatment in the first version of .  Treating the structures in terms of principal bundles and soldering forms (of appropriate type) the –case looks essentially the same as the other cases. Hence we will give a uniform treatment below and also refer to conformally Fedosov structures as PCS–structures of type .">

  <outline text="Invariant operators on parabolic contact structures" _note="The uniform description of parabolic contact structures is via Cartan geometries of type . A parabolic contact structure of type on a manifold determines a principal –bundle and a normal Cartan connection . Factoring by the free action of , we obtain a principal –bundle . The Cartan connection descends to a soldering form that defines a reduction of the frame bundles of the associated graded to the tangent bundle, see Section 2.3 of for more details. If is not of type , then this is the equivalent encoding of the geometry as discussed in Section  .  Any representation of the group gives rise to a natural vector bundle on parabolic contact structures of type via forming associated bundles to the Cartan bundle. We will only meet natural bundles obtained in this way in this article. The general representation theory of is rather complicated, but irreducible and hence completely reducible representations of are easy to understand. If is such a representation, then the nilpotent normal subgroup acts trivially on , so we obtain a representation of . This immediately implies that the associated bundle can be naturally identified with . Hence natural bundles associated to completely reducible representations can be readily understood in terms of the underlying structure. Finally, the group is always reductive, so its representation theory is well understood.  The equivalence between parabolic contact structures and Cartan geometries in particular implies that any automorphism of a parabolic contact structure on lifts to a bundle–automorphism of which preserves . This implies an analogous result for an infinitesimal automorphism , i.e. a vector field whose local flows are automorphisms. Such a vector field always uniquely lifts to a –invariant vector field such that for the Lie derivative , we get . Invariance of implies that there is an intermediate vector field whose flow preserves the soldering form. We will be particularly interested in the case of TRANSVERSE infinitesimal automorphisms, i.e. the case that all values of are transverse to the contact subbundle (so in particular, is nowhere vanishing).  Given a representation of , the space of sections of the natural bundle can be naturally identified with the space of –equivariant smooth functions . Given vector field , we can differentiate such equivariant functions and if is –invariant, then the resulting function will be equivariant and hence correspond to a section. Hence an equivariant vector field acts on sections of any natural vector bundle, and we will denote this action by .  If is completely reducible then –equivariancy of a function implies invariance under the group . Hence such a function descends to and is –equivariant there. A –invariant vector field as above induces a –invariant vector field on and we can use to differentiate sections as above, thus obtaining the same action as above.  There is a general concept of invariant differential operators acting between sections of natural vector bundles over manifolds endowed with a parabolic contact structure of some fixed type. For our puposes it suffices to know that such an operator is defined on any manifold endowed with a structure of the given type and that these operators are compatible with the inclusion of open subsets (endowed with the restricted structure) and with the action of isomorphisms. Hence they are compatible with the action of local isomorphism and in particular of local automorphisms. Applying this to local flows, we conclude that for an infinitesimal automorphism of the Cartan geometry determined by a parabolic contact structure, any invariant differential operator commutes with the action of . In the case of completely reducible bundles, one may as well work on the –principal bundle using .">

  <outline text="PCS–quotients" _note="The fundamental notion for the study of contactifications in the realm of PCS–structures and parabolic contact structures in is a PCS–quotient. Suppose that we have given a parabolic contact structure of type on together with a transverse infinitesimal automorphism of this geometry. Then is nowhere vanishing and hence defines a one–dimensional foliation of . Basically, a PCS–quotient is a global space of leafs for this foliation which is endowed with a PCS–structure of type that can be viewed as a quotient of the parabolic contact structure.  To formulate the precise definition, let be the –bundle determined by the parabolic contact structure and let be its soldering form. Now for a PCS–quotient, one requires  a surjective submersion onto a smooth manifold such that the fibers of are connected and their tangent spaces are spanned by  a PCS–structure of type on with –bundle and soldering form  a lift of to a morphism of principal bundles which is a surjective submersion with connected fibers, whose tangent spaces are spanned by and such that coincides with the component of the “upstairs” soldering form (see Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of for details)    If is not of type , then the above is exactly the definition of a PCS–quotient from Section 2.4 of . If is of type , then the discussion in Section 3.3 of shows that the same setup is available for a projective contact structure (with vanishing contact torsion) on and a conformally Fedosov structure on , see in particular the proof of the first part of Theorem 8 of .  As it stands, the concept of a PCS–quotient may look rather restrictive and one might doubt whether there are many examples. However, the results of and of imply that there are lots of examples. This is best formulated in the language of PARABOLIC CONTACTIFICATIONS of PCS–structures. By a parabolic contactifications of a PCS–structure , we simply mean a realization of as a PCS–quotient of a parabolic contact structure of type (respectively that parabolic contact structure). For later use, let us collect the fundamental results on parabolic contactifications:    (1) Let be a PCS–structure with underlying conformally symplectic structure . Then any open subset over which admits a nowhere–vanishing section which is exact as a two–form on admits a parabolic contactification.  \(2) Let and be two PCS–structures endowed with fixed parabolic contactifications. Then locally any morphism of PCS–structures (compare with Section   below) lifts to a contactomorphism between the contactifications.  \(3) Any lift of a morphism of PCS–structures to a contactomorphism of parabolic contactifications is automatically compatible with the infinitesimal automorphisms up to a nowhere–vanishing, locally constant factor and a morphism of parabolic contact structures.  \(1) By Lemma 3.1 of , can be realized as the quotient of a contact manifold by a transverse infinitesimal contactomorphism. By Theorem 4 (for not of type )respectively part 2 of Theorem 8 (for of type ) of , a PCS–structure of type on lifts to a parabolic contact structure of type on , thus providing the required PCS–quotient.  The statement of (3) is proved in Theorem 5 (for not of type ) respectively in part 3 of Theorem 8 (for of type ) of . Moreover, by Proposition 3.1 of , the assumption of part (3) is locally satisfied for each morphism between PCS–structures endowed with contactifications, so (2) follows.  We want to remark that in we also constructed examples of global contactifications which will play an important role later on.">

  <outline text="Descending invariant differential operators to PCS–quotients" _note="Now suppose that is a representation of , which we can also view as a completely reducible representation of . Then as discussed in Section  , this gives rise to a (completely reducible) natural vector bundle on parabolic contact structures of type . Given such a geometry we denote the resulting bundle by . As noted in Section  , we can also view as the bundle associated to the underlying –bundle.  On the other hand, one also obtains a natural vector bundle on PCS–structures of type , since they are also defined by a principal –bundle. Given such a geometry we write for this bundle.  Now it is well known that sections of an associated bundle can be viewed as equivariant functions on the total space of the inducing principal bundle. Explicitly, the space of sections is naturally isomorphic to Evidently, such a function can be pulled back via to a smooth equivariant function , which then defines a smooth section of . This defines an injection , which we denote by .    Let be a PCS–quotient by a transversal infinitesimal automorphism of a parabolic contact structure of type with bundle map . Let be a representations of and consider the corresponding induced bundles and as above. Let be the –invariant vector field induced by and consider the induced map on the space .  Then the the image of coincides with the kernel of .  In the language of equivariant functions, is simply given by differentiating vector valued functions using the vector field . (This preserves the space of equivariant functions since is –invariant.) In view of this, the result follows from the description of in terms of equivariant functions, since the fibers of are connected by assumption and their tangent spaces are spanned by .  Having this at hand, we can formulate the fundamental results about descending invariant differential operators.    Let be a PCS–quotient by a transversal infinitesimal automorphism of a parabolic contact structure of type with bundle map , and let and be representations of . Further, let be a linear invariant differential operator for the given parabolic contact structure.  Then there is a unique linear differential operator such that .  Since is an invariant differential operator, it commutes with pullback along the flow of . Infinitesimally, this means that , so in particular maps to . Using Lemma  , we conclude that given , there is a unique section such that , so we can define to obtain an operator with the desired property. Clearly, is linear, and in local coordinates it is evident that is a differential operator. Alternatively, one may observe that if vanishes on an open subset , then vanishes on . Since is a differential operator, the same holds for so vanishes on . Thus is a local operator and thus a differential operator by the Peetre theorem.">

  <outline text="Naturality of the descended operators" _note="We next show that pushing down to PCS–quotients can be used to construct natural operators on the category of PCS–structures from invariant differential operators for the corresponding parabolic contact structure. To explain the meaning of “natural operator”, we have to recall some concepts.  First a morphism of PCS–structures is defined to be a principal bundle morphism which covers a local diffeomorphism of the base manifolds and is compatible with the soldering forms. Next, we need the concept of a natural vector bundle on the category of PCS–structures, but here we restrict to bundles associated to the defining principal bundle. So as in Section  , we take a representation of and for a PCS–structure we define . The soldering form can then be used to identify natural bundles of this type with more traditional natural bundles like tensor bundles.  This implies that any morphism of PCS–structures, say on and , induces a vector bundle map , which restricts to a linear isomorphism on each fiber. Compatibility with the soldering forms implies that this is compatible with the identifications with tensor bundles, i.e. one obtains the usual induced bundle maps there. The induced vector bundle maps can then be used to pull back sections of associated bundles: For , there is a unique section such that .  Now given a second representation , a natural operator between sections of the corresponding associated bundles is defined as a family of differential operators which is compatible with the actions of all pullback operators associated to morphisms of PCS–structures. Hence for any morphism to a PCS–structure over , and any section we require , where (as usual) we denote all pullback operators by the same symbol. For the moment, we stick to this general concept, some remarks on more restrictive concepts of invariant operators are made below.    Let and be two representations of , which we also view as completely reducible representation of . Then any invariant operator on the category of parabolic contact structures of type between sections of the natural bundles induced by the two representations canonically induces a natural differential operator on the category of PCS–structures of type acting between sections of the induced bundles corresponding to the two representations.  This follows rather easily from the results on PCS–contactifications in Theorem  . Let us start with a PCS–structure on , a section and a point . By part (1) of Theorem  , there is an open neighborhood of in which can be realized as a PCS–quotient . Given the invariant operator on parabolic contact structures, we can use Theorem   to obtain an operator . In particular, we can apply this to to obtain a section of defined over .  To complete the proof, we need a fact on pullbacks of sections. (This may look rather obvious in written form, but this is slightly deceiving, since this relates two different concepts of pullback, which are denoted in the same way. In particular, one of this is non–standard since it relates bundles over different manifolds.) Suppose that and are PCS–structures endowed with parabolic contactifications and , and let us denote the corresponding bundles by , , and , respectively. Assume further that is a morphism of PCS–structures and that is a lift to a morphism of parabolic contact structures which is compatible with the infinitesimal automorphisms up to a constant multiple. Then for any section of a natural bundle over , we have .  To prove this claim, observe that if is the equivariant function on corresponding to , then and correspond to and , respectively. Since is compatible with the infinitesimal automorphisms up to constant multiple, the fact that lies in the kernel of implies that lies in the kernel of . Thus it must be of the form for some section and then implies that , which completes the proof of the claim.  Returning to and , we can carry out the above construction for the elements of an open covering of , so for each we descend to a section of defined over . If , then by parts (2) and (3) of Theorem  , the identity on locally lifts to an isomorphism of the parabolic contact structures which is compatible with the transversal infinitesimal automorphisms up to a constant multiple. By the claim, this implies that over the open subset in question, we have . Invariance of now implies that , so . Again by the claim, the right hand side equals . Thus, locally on , we have , so this has to hold on all of .  On the one hand, this shows that the sections can be pieced together to define a global section . On the other hand, applying the argument to the union of two coverings, we see that is independent of the choice of covering, so we have obtained a well defined linear differential operator . Thus it remains to prove that the define a natural operator. Naturality of a differential operator can be verified locally, so in view of Theorem  , it suffices to do this for PCS–structures admitting a global contactification and for morphisms which lift to the contactifications. But in this case, the required property follows immediately from the claim.">

<outline text="(Relative) BGG complexes and subcomplexes" _note="Since PCS–structures admit canonical connections, constructing differential operators, which are intrinsic to such structures, is not difficult. As in Riemannian geometry, one can simply form iterated covariant derivatives with respect to induced linear connections, combine them with iterated covariant derivatives of the torsion and the curvature of the canonical connection and then apply tensorial operations. Constructing differential COMPLEXES naturally associated to such geometries is a completely different issue, and it is not at all clear, how to do this “by hand”.  On the other hand, there are general constructions for a large number of differential complexes on locally flat parabolic contact structures as well as on certain non–flat structure of type . All these complexes can be pushed down to PCS–quotients thus providing a large number of differential complexes, which are naturally associated to such structures.">
  <outline text="BGG sequences" _note="Let us start with a type of parabolic geometries and a finite dimensional representation of . Associated to these data there is a sequence of invariant differential operators acting on sections of certain irreducible natural vector bundles over parabolic geometries of type . A construction for these sequences was given in and improved in . More recently, the construction was generalized and substantially improved in . In the case of the homogeneous model of the geometry, the resulting sequence turns out to be a complex and a fine resolution of the locally constant sheaf . In a certain sense this resolution is dual to Lepowsky’s generalization (see ) of the Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand resolution of by homomorphisms of Verma modules. The fact that the BGG sequence is a complex, extends from the homogeneous model to all parabolic contact structures which are locally isomorphic to , i.e. to the locally flat geometries. Also in this more general case, the BGG complex is a fine resolution of a sheaf, which can be described explicitly as the sheaf of those sections of the tractor bundle associated to , which are parallel for the canonical tractor connection.  Applying the push–down construction from Section   to a BGG-sequence, one therefore obtains a complex if all local contactifications of a given PCS–structure are locally flat. The latter property is analyzed in Theorem 7 and Corollary 1 of , where it is shown to be equivalent to the fact that the canonical connection associated to the PCS–structure is a special symplectic connection in the sense of . Since conversely any special symplectic connection is the canonical connection associated to a PCS–structure, we conclude that the pushed down versions of BGG complexes are associated to special symplectic connections. We should point out here that global contactifications as discussed in Sections 2.6 and 3.4 of are of particular interest here. These are contactifications of compact PCS–structures, which are circle bundles, and in this case it is possible to analyze the cohomology of the resulting complexes, see Section  .  The bundles showing up in a BGG sequence are associated to the representations of on the Lie algebra homology groups . Here is the nilradical of the parabolic subalgebra , and there is a general result that these homology representations are always completely reducible. Hence in the complex case, they can be described in terms of weights and Kostant’s theorem (see ) gives an explicit way to compute the relevant weights algorithmically. These results can be extended to the real case using complexifications. In what follows, we will usually suppress such computations and just describe the resulting bundles explicitly.  Invariance of the operators in a BGG sequence can also be used to determine the principal part of the operator. By construction, the principal symbol of any operator showing up in a BGG sequence has to be a natural bundle map and thus is induced by a –homomorphism between the inducing representations. As noted above, the inducing representations are completely reducible, so the action of comes from a representation of the reductive group , whose representation theory is well understood.  To described the BGG complexes associated to special symplectic connections, the main task therefore is to convert the representation theory information available for the parabolic contact structures into information on bundles on PCS–quotients. We will do this in a bit more detail for the and types and sketch how things look for the other types.">

  <outline text="Example: Complexes associated to connections of Ricci type" _note="This is the case discussed in Section 3 of . One starts with a conformally Fedosov structure on a smooth manifold , which is given by a conformally symplectic structure and a projective class of torsion free linear connections on , which satisfy a certain compatibility condition. Locally, this structure determines a symplectic form on (up to a constant multiple) and a unique connection in the projective class such that . So locally, the structure is just given by a torsion–free symplectic connection, see Proposition 2 in . Any local contactification of then inherits a canonical contact projective structure, which is locally flat if and only if the connection is of Ricci type, see Theorem 8 and Corollary 1 in .  The irreducible natural bundles available in this situation are easy to describe. They are equivalent to irreducible representation of , where . Irreducible representations of the center are one–dimensional and thus give rise to natural line bundles. On the other hand the irreducible representations of can all be constructed from the standard representation by tensorial operations. For a contact projective structure on , the standard representation of corresponds to the contact subbundle . The basic natural line bundle in this case is the quotient , and one can construct density bundles as (real) roots of the line bundle , which has to be trivial.  For a PCS–structure on , the standard representation of corresponds to the tangent bundle . Now on , the Levi bracket induces an isomorphism , whereas on , inserting vector fields into elements of defines an isomorphism , which shows that the representation of , which gives rise to on corresponds to on , compare with Section 3.2 of . This is sufficient to explicitly associate to any irreducible representation of a weighted tensor bundle (a tensor product of a natural line bundle with a natural subbundle of a tensor bundle) on .  Using this, we can give a description of the resulting sequences in the spirit of the parametrization of BGG sequences for AHS–structures introduced in . To do this, we make one more observation. Suppose that and are two irreducible representations of . Then in the tensor product , there is a specific irreducible component called the CARTAN PRODUCT, which we denote by . This is the component of maximal highest weight respectively the subrepresentation generated by the tensor product of two highest weight vectors. Given two natural tensor bundles and , we denote by the irreducible tensor subbundle corresponding to the Cartan product of the inducing representations. Since occurs in with multiplicity one, there is a unique (up to scale) natural bundle map , which we call the canonical projection onto the Cartan product.    Let be an irreducible tensor bundle on conformally symplectic manifolds of dimension and let be an integer, which, depending on has to be even or odd. Then pushing down an appropriate BGG sequence on local contactifications, one obtains on any conformally Fedosov manifold of dimension a sequence of weighted irreducible tensor bundles and invariant differential operators of the form This sequence is a complex if the canonical connection of is of Ricci–type. Moreover, is a tensor product of with some density bundle, and is the Cartan product . The operator has order and its principal part is given by forming the –fold covariant derivative with respect to (the connection induced by) , symmetrizing and then projecting to the Cartan product.  We have , is the stabilizer of a line in the standard representation. The semisimple part of , which is isomorphic to , can be identified with the space of those maps, which vanish on a non–degenerate plane containing this line. Since is a split real form, it has a root decomposition and there is a simple root , such that a root space lies in if and only if is linear combination of the other simple roots . Now let be the corresponding fundamental weights, so dominant integral weights for are linear combinations of these weights with non–negative integral coefficients. If such a linear combination does not involve , then it can naturally be viewed as a weight of , and all weights of arise in this way.  For our purposes, it is better to describe representations by the negatives of lowest weights rather than using the usual description in terms of highest weights, but this causes only small differences. The irreducible tensor bundle then corresponds to a weight of . Representing this weight as a linear combination of and adding (where is the chosen integer), we obtain a dominant integral weight. This corresponds to a finite dimensional irreducible representation of , which integrates to the group . Now let us in addition assume that the sum of the coefficients of those with odd is even, which, depending on , means that has to be even or that has to be odd. Then the homomorphism defining the representation factorizes to , and hence gives rise to a BGG–sequence on parabolic geometries of type which are equivalent to contact projective structures.  Via the construction in Section   we can descend this to a sequence of invariant differential operators on conformally Fedosov structures. The BGG sequence is a complex if the contact projective structure is locally flat, so we obtain a complex if the canonical connection of the conformally Fedosov structure is of Ricci type. To prove the rest of the theorem we need some information on the bundles occurring in the BGG sequence, which all follow from the description of the homology groups via Kostant’s theorem. The homology groups split into a direct sum of different irreducible representations of , and the corresponding weights are obtained from the weight determined by by the affine action of a certain subset of the Weyl group of . The homology degree in which an irreducible component occurs is given by the length of the corresponding Weyl group element.  Using the algorithms from Section 3.2.16 of , one easily verifies that consists of elements, which have length , , …, , respectively. This implies that the BGG sequence and hence the descended sequence has the claimed form with an irreducible bundle in each degree between and . The unique element of length zero in is the identity, so is the representation of corresponding to the same weight as . But this exactly says that is the tensor product of with a natural line bundle. The unique element of length one in is the simple reflection corresponding to . The affine action by this reflection maps to , which is just the sum of the initial weight with . Now is the lowest weight of , so is the negative of the lowest weight of the representation inducing , which implies the claim on . The claim on the principal part of then follows from invariance on the level of contact projective structures.  Via Kostant’s theorem, the representations inducing the bundles in the sequence can be determined explicitly and algorithmically. However, for , the explicit form of the bundles depends on the initial representation in a more complicated way. Let us just describe one situation in a bit more detail, which in particular covers the complexes used in . To obtain these complexes, we use the global contactification defined by the Hopf–fibration. This can be interpreted as a PCS–contactification of the conformally Fedosov structure on defined by the Levi–Civita connection of the Fubini–Study metric by the flat contact projective structure on , see Section 3.4 in .  In the language of Theorem  , the relevant complexes correspond to the case that for some and to . Hence one starts with a completely symmetric covariant tensor of valence and is given by taking a covariant derivative and then completely symmetrizing the result. For the applications in one mainly needs the principal part of the operator in that complex and the information that, on , one has . Here we indicate how to get the necessary information on the principal part, the cohomology of the sequence will be discussed in Section   below, see in particular Theorem  .  We actually discuss a slightly more general setting, looking at the case that with an arbitrary even number . In the language of the proof of Theorem  , the weight determining is . The unique element of length two in the Hasse diagram is given by , where we write for the reflection corresponding to the th simple root. The affine action of this composition maps to , so this is the weight corresponding to the bundle , which we denote by to indicate the dependence on . The bundle is described in in detail. Up to a twist by a natural line bundle, this is the Cartan product of copies of , i.e. it corresponds to the highest weight subspace in . Hence it can be viewed as tensors with indices which come up as skew symmetric pairs and the tensor is symmetric under permutations of the pairs of indices.  Representation theory also implies that there is a unique (up to a constant) natural bundle map on conformally symplectic manifolds. This is basically given by grouping the indices into pairs and then alternating each pair. By Theorem  , the bundle is, for , isomorphic to . Hence one can use information on BGG sequences on contact projective structures, to see that has order and obtain information on its principal part.  For general , the situation is similar. Up to a twist by a natural line bundle, is the Cartan product of and , while . Basic representation theory again shows that there is a unique (up to scale) natural bundle map on conformally symplectic manifolds. This shows that still has order in the general case, and one can use results on BGG sequences to get information on its principal part.    Let us briefly discuss the restriction on the parity of the integer which determines the order of the first operator in the sequence in Theorem  . From the proof it is clear that this is only needed in order that a certain Lie algebra representation integrates to a group representation of . However, for any choice of , the Lie algebra representations integrate to representations of . Hence this restriction could be avoided if one can construct a parabolic geometry of type on the contactifications, for example by choosing some additional data on the given conformally Fedosov structure.  It seems very plausible that this is possible, at least locally, or provided that the line bundle defining the conformally symplectic structure is trivial. However, Section 3.4 of shows that this does not work in a straightforward way for the global contactification defined by the Hopf–fibration. We will not study this question further here.">

  <outline text="Complexes associated to Bochner–bi–Lagrangean metrics" _note="We next discuss the case of PCS–structures associated to simple Lie algebras of type . Here there are two basic structures related to different real forms of , see Section 3.2 of . For the split real form , the corresponding PCS–structure is given by a conformally symplectic structure and a decomposition into a sum of Lagrangean subbundles. Such a structure is torsion–free if and only if the subbundles and in are involutive. In this case, one obtains a para–Kähler–metric on and the canonical connection for the PCS–structure is the Levi–Civita connection of this metric.  Parabolic contactification for PCS–structures of this type produces a so–called Lagrangean contact structure, i.e. a contact structure together with a decomposition of the contact subbundle into a direct sum of Lagrangean subbundles, see Section 4.2.3 of . Torsion–freeness in this picture again is equivalent to involutivity of the two Lagrangean subbundles. To obtain differential complexes from BGG–sequences on the parabolic contactification, we need this contactification to be locally flat (and thus in particular torsion–free). By Theorem 7 of , this is the case if and only if the metric is Bochner–bi–Lagrangean.  To formulate the theorem on BGG sequences in this case, observe that for the algebra has center and semi–simple part . Up to twisting by natural line bundles the subbundles correspond to the standard representation of and its dual. Hence all bundles corresponding to irreducible representations of can be obtained from natural line bundles and these two basic bundles via tensorial constructions. Thus we can use a similar parametrization of BGG sequences as in Theorem  .    Let be an irreducible representation of and let be the corresponding natural tensor bundle on a PCS–manifold of para–Kähler type of dimension (with playing the role of the standard representation and playing the role of its dual). Let be integers such that for even , the number is, depending on , either even or odd.  Then pushing down an appropriate BGG sequence on parabolic contactifications leads to a sequence of tensor bundles and invariant differential operators of the form This sequence is a complex, if is Bochner–bi–Lagrangean. Moreover, the bundles and are irreducible, while for the bundles and each split into a direct sum of irreducible tensor bundles. Finally, is the tensor product of with a natural line bundle, while with and .  Put and let be the semisimple part of . Then for the standard numbering of simple roots of , a root space is contained in if and only if is a linear combination of only. Hence these roots form a simple system for . Denoting by the fundamental weights corresponding to the simple system , dominant weights for are equivalent to linear combinations of with non–negative integral coefficients. As before, we use negatives of lowest weights rather than highest weights. Anyway, the irreducible representation determines a dominant integral weight of , which can be written as a linear combination of with non–negative integral coefficients.  Adding to this weight, we obtain a dominant integral weight for , which determines an irreducible representation of . Now we have to discuss whether the representation integrates to the group , thus giving rise to a tractor bundle and hence to a BGG sequence on Lagrangean contact structures. For odd , this is not a problem, since the map induces an isomorphism in this case. In the case of even , is well known to be isomorphic to . Hence integrates if and only if the center of acts trivially on . In terms of the negative of the lowest weight, written as , this boils down to the condition that the sum of all coefficients with odd indices is even. Depending on , this means that either has to be even or has to be odd.  Having as a representation of , the existence of a BGG sequence on parabolic geometries of type which are equivalent to Lagrangean contact structures follows from the general theory developed in . Using the results from Section  , this can be pushed down to a sequence of invariant differential operators on PCS–structures of para–Kähler type. The BGG sequence is a complex if the Lagrangean contact structure is locally flat, so we obtain a complex on Bochner–bi–Lagrangean manifolds.  The bundles showing up in the BGG sequence correspond to the Lie algebra homology groups , which can be computed using Kostant’s theorem. In particular, is the –irreducible quotient of which has the same lowest weight. This is the tensor product of with the one–dimensional representation corresponding to , which shows that is the tensor product of with a natural line bundle.  As noted in the proof of Theorem  , the basic structure of is encoded in the Hasse diagram associated to the parabolic , which is determined in Section 3.6 of . In particular, this contains the information of the number of irreducible components in for each , thus proving the claims on the number of irreducible summands in each . Finally, the components of correspond to simple reflections contained in . These are exactly the reflections corresponding to and , respectively. Their action on the weight is given by adding and , respectively. Since these are the negatives of the lowest weights of and , respectively, the claim on follows.">

  <outline text="Remarks on BGG sequences associated to Bochner–Kähler metrics" _note="PACS–structures of Kähler type correspond to the real forms of . Such a structure corresponds to a conformally symplectic structure and an almost complex structure on , for which is Hermitian. Torsion–freeness of the structure is equivalent to being a complex structure, which then gives rise to a pseudo–Kähler metric of signature on . Parabolic contactifications of PCS–structures of this type are partially integrable almost CR structures of the appropriate signature, see Section 4.2.4 of . Torsion–freeness is equivalent to the structure being integrable and hence a CR structure. By Theorem 7 of , such a parabolic contactification is locally flat if and only if it is torsion free and the corresponding metric is Bochner–Kähler (of any signature).  As the description suggests, there are strong similarities to para–Kähler type as discussed in Section   above. In view of this similarities, we will only briefly outline the differences to the para–Kähler case.  For , the subalgebra has center and semi–simple part . Up to twisting by natural line bundles, the tangent bundle corresponds to the standard representation of . The analogy to the para–Kähler case becomes clear after complexification, where we get and the two summands correspond to dual representations of . This shows that, after complexification, the situation is parallel to the para–Kähler case, with complex linearity and anti–linearity properties replacing the decomposition into and .  BGG sequences on partially integrable almost CR structures are associated both to real and to complex representations of the group which governs the geometry. A complex representation of is again determined by its restriction to (which also is a complex representation) and two non–negative integers describing the action of the center. However, in this case the center of is isomorphic to , so the condition that a representation integrates to imposes more restrictive conditions on the two integers describing the action of the center. Correspondingly, there are less BGG sequences available then in the para–Kähler case, unless it is possible to choose an additional structure as discussed in Remark  .  Once a complex representation of and two non–negative integers and give rise to a complex representation of , the situation becomes very similar to Theorem  , compare with Sections 3.6 and 3.8 of . There is a sequence differential operators for , which is a complex provided that one starts with a Bochner–Kähler metric of any signature. The bundles and are irreducible, whereas and split into a direct sum of bundles associated to complex irreducible representations for . One may also describe and the principal parts of the two components of similarly to Theorem  , with complex linearity and conjugate linearity replacing the appearance of copies of and .  There are also BGG sequences of partially integrable almost CR structures induced by real representations of (which do not admit a –invariant complex structure). Again, such a representation is determined by its restriction to , which is a real irreducible representation, and by the action of the center. Since there is no complex structure available, there are stronger restrictions for the action of the center than in the complex case here. Next, one needs to make sure that the resulting representation of integrates to . Having given a real representation of , there again is a BGG sequence of the same length as in the complex case, see again Section 3.8 of . The main difference to the complex case is the number of irreducible components of the bundles and , which now is for odd and for even . In particular, in this case and both are irreducible and the principal part of is just given by a symmetrized iterated covariant derivative followed by a projection to the Cartan product.">

  <outline text="Relative BGG sequences" _note="We now turn to a second general construction of sequences and complexes of invariant differential operators on parabolic geometries, which was introduced in the recent article . To simplify comparison to that reference, we briefly change notation and denote the parabolic subgroup corresponding to a contact grading. The construction of relative BGG sequences on geometries of type in addition needs a second parabolic subgroup such that . Hence in the case of parabolic contact structures, this construction is only available for the –series, since for the other series the parabolic subalgebra corresponding to the contact grading is maximal. Even in the –case, an intermediate parabolic is only available for the real form , for the real forms the parabolic corresponding to the contact grading again is maximal. Hence relative BGG sequences can only be used to construct invariant differential operators on PCS–structures of para–Kähler type. However, in this case the resulting sequences are highly interesting since they give rise to differential complexes under much weaker assumptions than coming from a Bochner–bi–Lagrangean metric.  Given a type and an intermediate parabolic , the input needed to construct a relative BGG sequence is a finite dimensional, completely reducible representation of the group . Complete reducibility means that the nilpotent subgroup acts trivially, so is a representation of the reductive Levi–factor . The bundles showing up in the relative BGG sequence determined by are induced by certain Lie algebra homology groups which we describe next. The setup easily implies that and that is an ideal. Hence naturally is a Lie algebra, which acts on since the restriction to of the derivative of the –action descends to the quotient. The homology groups in question then are the groups , which can be computed algorithmically using a relative version of Kostant’s theorem, see . As before, we will simply state the resulting descriptions of bundles in the sequence.  There are general results showing that relative BGG sequences are complexes under much weaker assumptions than local flatness. The relevant concept here is called relative curvature. Given a parabolic geometry of type and an intermediate parabolic , the –invariant subspace gives rise to a subbundle called the RELATIVE TANGENT BUNDLE. Likewise, the –invariant subspaces corresponds to subbundles in the adjoint tractor bundle . One defines the relative adjoint tractor bundle of the geometry to be .  Now the first condition one has to impose is that is an involutive distribution. This is easily seen to be equivalent to the curvature having the property that its values on two tangent vectors from always lie in . Assuming this, the values can be projected to the relative adjoint tractor bundle, thus defining a section of the bundle . This is the relative curvature of the geometry, and if this vanishes identically, any relative BGG sequence on is a complex and a fine resolution of a certain sheaf on , which locally descends to leaf spaces of the distribution .">

  <outline text="Relative BGG complexes associated to para–Kähler metrics" _note="In the case of PCS–structures of para–Kähler type in dimension , the group is and the parabolic subgroup comes from the stabilizer of a flag consisting of a line contained in a hyperplane in the standard representation. Hence , where comes from the stabilizer of the line and comes from the stabilizer of the hyperplane. Since and are maximal parabolic subgroups in , they are the only two possible choices of intermediate parabolic subgroups in this case. A parabolic geometry of type is given by a contact structure and a decomposition into a direct sum of Legendrean subbundles. It is easy to see that the relative tangent bundles corresponding to and are just the subbundle and , respectively. In particular, the situation between and is completely symmetric, so it suffices to discuss one of the two cases.  On the level of PCS–structures, we have a smooth manifold of dimension , a conformally symplectic structure and a decomposition into subbundles which are Lagrangean for . As discussed in Section 3.2 of , this gives rise to a split–signature conformal structure on , by extending the pairing between and induced by a local section of to a symmetric tensor field, for which the two subbundles are isotropic. In the PCS–case, local closed sections of are uniquely determined up to constant multiples, so we even get local split signature metrics which are unique up to a constant factor (and hence all have the same Levi–Civita connection). In Section 4.5 of , it is shown that torsion freeness of the PCS–structure defined by , and is equivalent to the fact that the subbundles and are both involutive. Since the canonical connection of the PCS–structure preserves the distinguished metrics by construction, torsion–freeness shows that it has to coincide with the Levi–Civita connection in this case.  Here we can work in a slightly more general situation, namely that the one of the subbundles, say , is involutive. Assuming that is non–involutive, the canonical connection of the PCS–structure has non–trivial torsion (since is preserves ). More precisely, identifying with the restriction of the torsion to the last two summands has to be trivial, whereas the restriction to the first summand coincides with the negative of the tensorial map induced by projecting the Lie bracket to . In particular, has to be different from the Levi–Civita connection of the distinguished metrics. However, since by construction preserves the distinguished metrics (since it preserves , and ), and its torsion is known, there is an explicit formula relating it to the Levi–Civita connection.  To formulate the result on complexes induced by relative BGG complexes, we need a bit more information on the groups involved. Recall that , comes from the stabilizer of a line in the standard representation, while comes from the stabilizer of the flag consisting of that line and a hyperplane containing it. Via the restriction of the adjoint action of , acts on on and it is well known that this induces an isomorphism , compare with Section 4.1.5 of . Moreover, the sum of all but the lowest grading components of with respect to the grading defined by is a codimension–one subspace containing . Hence is a hyperplane and can be characterized as those elements whose action on stabilizes this hyperplane, see Section 4.4.2 of . This gives rise to a surjection which has in its kernel. For a parabolic contact structure of type , the vector bundle induced by this representation is . Viewing the above homomorphism as its kernel is isomorphic to . A faithful representation of this kernel corresponds to on each parabolic contact structure.    Let be an irreducible representation of and let be the corresponding natural tensor bundle on a PCS–manifold of para–Kähler type of dimension (with playing the role of the standard representation) and let be an integer.  Then pushing down an appropriate relative BGG sequence on parabolic contactifications leads to a sequence of irreducible tensor bundles and invariant differential operators of the form This sequence is a complex, if the subbundle is involutive. The bundle is the tensor product of with an real power of the line bundle and .  Finally suppose that is chosen in such a way that coincides with one of the irreducible summands in the bundles from Theorem  . Then the same holds for all the bundles and the sequence constructed here is a subsequence respectively a subcomplex in the sequence from that Theorem.  Consider with simple roots and corresponding fundamental weights as in the proof of Theorem  . The corresponding Cartan subalgebra also is a Cartan subalgebra for the reductive subalgebras and . Let us decompose as described on the group level before the theorem. Then the negative of the lowest weight of the representation can be expressed as a linear combination with and non–negative integers . Adding to this, we obtain a weight which is the negative of the lowest weight of a finite dimensional, irreducible representation of . (The part is a dominant integral weight for the semisimple part of , and adding corresponds to tensorizing by a one–dimensional representation of the center.) There is no problem with the representation integrating to the group .  Hence the general results of imply the existence of an associated relative BGG–sequence for each parabolic geometry of type . Via the mechanism introduced in Section  , this sequence can be pushed down a manifold endowed with a PCS–structure from local contactifications. The bundles showing up in the resulting sequence are induced by the Lie algebra homology groups , in particular the degrees range from to . To obtain the shape of the sequence, one has to determine the relative Hasse diagram as described in Lemma 2.6 and Example 3.2 of . It is easy to see consists of elements of length . This implies the statement on irreducibility of for each . Moreover, is the –irreducible quotient of , which implies the description of . The unique element of length in is the simple reflection corresponding to , from which the description of follows as in the proof of Theorem  .  Suppose next, that the subbundle is involutive. Then for each local parabolic contactification , the subbundle is involutive, too. As we have observed above, this is exactly the relative tangent bundle for the intermediate parabolic . By Proposition 4.2.3 of this implies that one of the three harmonic curvature components of the parabolic geometry on vanishes identically. But the discussion of harmonic curvature in Section 4.2.3 of shows that the assumptions of part (1) of Proposition 4.18 of are satisfied, so the relative curvature of the geometry vanishes. By part (1) of Theorem 4.11 of that reference, any relative BGG sequence on is a complex, so the descended sequence is a complex, too.  To prove that last claim, we observe that by Kostant’s theorem, all –dominant weights in the affine Weyl orbit of the negative of the lowest weight of are realized by irreducible components of the representations for . Hence our assumptions mean that occurs as an irreducible component in one of these homology representations (which happen to be irreducible in our case). But by Theorem   of , the homologies are contained in , so all bundles occur in the sequence from Theorem  . It is proved in Theorem 5.2 of that then the absolute and the relative BGG constructions produce the same differential operators between these bundles, which implies the last claim.    As already remarked above, relative BGG sequences are not available for the parabolic contact geometries associated to . However, there is a case in which our methods can produce differential complexes on general Kähler manifolds (i.e. without the assumption on vanishing Bochner curvature). This is related to those cases in Theorem   in which a relative BGG sequence is included in a proper BGG sequence. In these cases, the existence of subcomplexes can also be proved more directly, see . While these techniques require slightly stronger assumption (involutivity of both and ), they also work for the other real forms.  In the setting of Section   this method applies to torsion–free PCS–structures of Kähler type, which are equivalent to pseudo–Kähler metrics of any signature, see Proposition 4.5 of . The local contactifications of such a geometry carry an (integrable) CR structure of hypersurface type of the same signature. As discussed in Section   there are BGG sequences on such structures associated to real and complex representations of the groups . Theorem 3.8 in shows that, both in the real and in the complex case, there are several subcomplexes in such a BGG sequences, which descend to differential complexes on the underlying pseudo–Kähler manifolds.">

Several steps towards these main results are proved in a more general setting.">
  <outline text="The relation to twisted de–Rham cohomology" _note="For the first step in the description, we need a few details on the construction of BGG sequences. As discussed in Section  , a BGG sequence on parabolic contact structures of type is determined by a representation of the Lie group . Via taking the associated bundle to the Cartan bundle determined by , this representation gives rise to a natural vector bundle on such geometries. On the homogeneous model , this is just the homogeneous vector bundle . Bundles of this type are called TRACTOR BUNDLES. Their main feature is that the Cartan connection induces a canonical linear connection on each tractor bundle, which is flat if and only if either is a trivial representation or the geometry is locally flat. Since the case of the trivial representation is treated in , we will always assume that is a non–trivial, irreducible representation from now on.  Given a parabolic contact geometry , let us denote by the tractor bundle on induced by and by the canonical tractor connection induced by . Coupling to the exterior derivative, one obtains the COVARIANT EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE for each . Obviously, this is a sequence of invariant differential operators and it is well known that they form a complex if and only if the connection is flat. We will refer to this as the twisted de–Rham sequence respectively the twisted de–Rham complex determined by .  Now it turns out that, via the Cartan connection , the cotangent bundle can be naturally identified with the associated bundle . Hence the bundle of –valued –forms is induced by the representation , which is the space of –chains in the standard complex computing the Lie algebra homology . Since the standard differentials in this complex are –equivariant, they induce natural bundle maps , which traditionally are denoted by . Hence and are nested natural subbundles in and the quotient is by construction isomorphic to the associated bundle which we denote by .  By construction, there is a bundle projection which induces a tensorial operator on the spaces of sections of these bundles that we denote by the same symbol. Now the key to the construction of BGG sequences is that there is an invariant differential operator which splits this tensorial projection. Otherwise put, to any section we can associate such that and . Moreover it turns out that this splitting operator has the property that for any (which uniquely determines ). Hence one can define an invariant differential operator by , and these operators form the BGG sequence. Moreover, if is flat, then the splitting operators have the property that for all . This readily implies that the BGG sequence is a complex, and the define a homomorphism of complexes from the BGG complex to the twisted de–Rham complex.  Now suppose that we have given a PCS–quotient of type , and let be the corresponding –principal bundle. Then by construction, the operators obtained by descending the operators act on sections of the bundle for all . (Here one uses that each is a completely reducible representation of , so it descends to .) Recall that the infinitesimal automorphism giving rise to the PCS–quotient induces a –invariant vector field which projects onto . Similarly as discussed in Section  , sections of associated bundles to can be identified with smooth functions with values in the inducing representation, so there is a natural action of via a Lie derivative . In particular, we define as the subspace of those forms , for which . This works in the same way on open subsets of so that we have actually defined a subsheaf of the sheaf of –valued –forms.    Consider a PCS–quotient of type . Let be a representation of , the tractor bundle determined by and the induced twisted de–Rham sequence. Let be the sequence of differential operators on obtained by descending the BGG sequence determined by as in Theorem  .  Then commutes with , and hence it preserves the subspaces . Moreover, if is flat, then these subspaces form a subcomplex in the twisted de–Rham complex, whose cohomology is naturally isomorphic to the cohomology of the complex .  Since any local flow of is an automorphism of the Cartan geometry , it follows as in Lemma   that any invariant differential operator commutes with . In particular, applying this to we readily conclude that . In the case that is flat, we hence get a subcomplex in the twisted de–Rham complex.  We can also apply this argument to the BGG operators . For a natural vector bundle let us denote by the kernel of . Naturality of the BGG operators then shows that we get a subcomplex in the BGG complex. Now since each is a completely reducible representation of , we can equivalently describe sections of the corresponding associated bundle via the intermediate principal bundle . Recall from Section   that there is a vector field which lies between and . By construction, identifying with , the subspace exactly corresponds to the kernel of the Lie derivative . Theorem   and Lemma   thus imply that the complex is isomorphic to .  Thus we can complete the proof by showing that computes the same cohomology as the subcomplex in the twisted de–Rham complex. For this, we can adapt the usual proof for BGG sequences from Theorem 2.6 and Lemma 2.7 of . Naturality of the splitting operators implies that for each we get . In particular, the fact that verified in Lemma 2.7 of shows that defines a complex map between the two subcomplexes, and we claim that this induces an isomorphism in cohomology. Suppose that satisfies . Then in Lemma 2.7 of it is shown that there is a form such that . As shown in Theorems 3.9 and 3.14 of , a form with this property can be obtained as the value of an invariant differential operator on . Thus we may assume that and hence . But then naturality of the bundle map shows that . Now by construction which shows that and . Hence the cohomology class of is mapped to the cohomology class of , so the induced map in cohomology is surjective.  On the other hand, suppose that satisfies and for some . As in the previous step, we may without loss of generality assume that and then project this to . Then shows that and hence , which shows injectivity of the induced map in cohomology.">

  <outline text="Reduction to horizontal equivariant forms" _note="Suppose that is a PCS–quotient with corresponding infinitesimal automorphism corresponding to . Then the forms in as studied above, are (in an appropriate sense) equivariant for . Similarly to the case of ordinary forms treated in Section 2.3 of , it is natural to next look at forms which in addition are horizontal, since these essentially are objects on already. Hence we define to be the space of those , for which and . To simplify notation, we will write and in what follows.  Recall that the infinitesimal automorphism determines a unique contact form for which is the Reeb field, i.e. such that and , see Proposition 2.2 of . Observe also, that there is an obvious wedge product . In terms of these operations, we can now derive a description of .    Let be a PCS–quotient of type with corresponding infinitesimal automorphism and let be the contact form associated to . Then the maps and define inverse isomorphisms between and .  Since , we see that both and are horizontal, and then one immediately verifies that the two maps in the claim are inverse to each other. So it remains to show that the construction can be restricted to the kernels of on both sides.  To do this, we have to derive some results on the operator , which by definition is given by differentiating the equivariant functions corresponding to sections of natural vector bundles in the direction of . Let us denote by the Cartan geometry describing the parabolic contact structure on . Then the isomorphism comes from the fact that for the map descends to a linear isomorphism . Otherwise put, the equivariant smooth function corresponding to a vector field can be written as , where is a –equivariant lift of . Since is an infinitesimal automorphism, the lift satisfies . This implies that for as above, we get . Since is a lift of , we conclude that . Hence on the operator coincides with the usual Lie derivative along , and in particular, .  By construction, satisfies the usual compatibility conditions with tensor products and contractions. Using this, the result for vector fields easily implies that coincides with the usual Lie derivative on all tensor fields and in particular on (real valued) differential forms. The definition of the contact form then implies that . Together with naturality and , this now implies that all the maps we have used preserve the kernels of .  For the next step, we have to impose an additional restriction on the infinitesimal automorphism in question. Since is –invariant vector field, equivariancy of the Cartan connection implies that is a –equivariant function. Thus it defines a smooth section of the associated bundle , the adjoint tractor bundle of the parabolic geometry . Indeed, this establishes a bijection between and the space of –invariant vector fields on . It turns out that infinitesimal automorphisms can be nicely characterized in this picture, see . Since is a tractor bundle, it carries the tractor connection . It turns out (see Proposition 3.2 of ) that this connection can be naturally modified by a term involving the Cartan curvature to a linear connection whose parallel sections exactly correspond to the canonical lifts of infinitesimal automorphisms . This bijection is implemented by an analog of the splitting operator discusses in Section   above. Moreover, it turns out that if a section of is parallel for , then it is also parallel for , see Corollary 3.5 of . Hence parallel sections of correspond to a subclass of infinitesimal automorphisms.    Let be a parabolic geometry of type . An infinitesimal automorphism of the geometry is called NORMAL if and only if the induced –invariant vector field corresponds to a section of which is parallel for the tractor connection .  By Corollary 3.5 of an infinitesimal automorphism is normal if and only if inserts trivially into the curvature two–form of the Cartan connection . In particular, any infinitesimal automorphism on a locally flat geometry is normal.  Next, we can use the infinitesimal automorphism and its lift to define a smooth bundle map on a tractor bundle . To define this, observe that for a representation of , so we have the infinitesimal representation . This means that any point defines a linear isomorphism , where . For any and , we then get , so , where denotes the representation of . On the other hand, the function satisfies . This shows that, denoting by the infinitesimal representation, we conclude that Thus we get a well defined linear map and hence a smooth bundle map as claimed.    Let be a parabolic geometry of type such that is connected. Let be a normal infinitesimal automorphism and let be the induced bundle map on a tractor bundle . Then has constant rank, so its kernel and its image are smooth subbundles of , and we get a smooth vector bundle .  In Lemma 2.3 of it is shown that connectedness of implies that for a normal infinitesimal automorphism , the image of the function is contained in a single orbit of the adjoint action of . Now for and , and the actions of and of on , it is well known that . This shows that the maps and have the same rank, which by construction implies that has constant rank. All other claims are well known consequences of this fact.  Using , we can now define several subspaces in the space of –valued differential forms. First, we of course have . Moreover, even though is not a natural vector bundle, it makes no problem to require as well as for . Thus we can define . The cokernel of is more complicated to deal with, and we need some preliminary results to do this.">

Using the standard formula for , one verifies that the value of maps vector fields to Let us denote by the section of the adjoint tractor bundle corresponding to . Then by the construction from Section  , the operator coincides with the so–called fundamental derivative , see Section 1.5.8 of . Likewise, the bundle map by construction coincides with the operation from Section 1.5.7 of . Thus the formula for the tractor connection in Theorem 1.5.8 of shows that the first summand in can be rewritten as In the second part of , we can move the Lie bracket to the th entry of at the expense of a sign . As noted in the proof of Lemma  , we have , so the second term in can be written as and naturality of implies that this adds up with the first term in to .  The last statement of the Lemma shows that does not preserve the subspace .

  <outline text="A long exact sequence" _note="We are now ready to construct a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which will be the fundamental tool to compute the cohomology of descended BGG sequences. To define the necessary maps, let us first make the definition of the cohomology of more explicit. We assume that from now on. A –cocycle in the complex by definition is represented by a form for which there is a form such that . We then simply write for the cohomology class represented by , and if and only if there are forms and such that .  Now let us assume that such that . Then by Lemma   we get and Lemma   shows that .

This shows that the cohomology class depends only on , so we get a well defined map    The maps and induce well defined maps in cohomology, which we denote by the same symbols, i.e.  and . Together with the map induced by the inclusion , these fit into a long exact sequence of the form  Since both and are evidently linear, we have to show that they vanish on elements representing trivial cohomology classes to obtain well defined maps in cohomology. If , then Lemma   shows that . Writing as , the second summand can be rewritten as by Lemma  . Hence we see that , and since , this has trivial class in .  On the other hand, take of degrees and respectively. To determine , we first have to compute the image of this element under . This gives , so Now the second and last term in the right hand side clearly cancel, and a short computation shows that , so the other two terms cancel, too. This shows that induces a well defined map in cohomology.  To prove exactness of the sequence, we first observe that for , we have by definition, so . On the other hand, suppose that satisfies and .

  <outline text="The case of the homogeneous model" _note="As a last step, we specialize further to the case of PCS–quotients of connected open subsets of the homogeneous model of a parabolic contact structure. In particular, this includes the global contactification in the two geometric interpretations discussed in Proposition 1 and Section 3.4 of . In the second case, we obtain generalizations of all results on cohomology needed for the applications in .  Observe that all restrictions we have imposed so far are satisfied for a connected open subset in , since any infinitesimal automorphism of a locally flat geometry is normal. The crucial additional ingredient we get for the homogeneous model is that any tractor bundle admits a global parallel frame.    Let be the homogeneous model of a parabolic contact structure, let be a representation of and the corresponding tractor bundle. For consider the section corresponding to the –equivariant function defined by . Then , so starting from a basis of , we obtain a global parallel frame for .  It is clear that each is equivariant and that the values of the in each point fill the whole fiber, so we only have to show that each is parallel. Applying the construction to the adjoint tractor bundle , we associate to the global section corresponding to the function . By equivariancy of the Maurer–Cartan form, this corresponds to the right–invariant vector field generated by .  Computing as the derivative at of immediately shows that , where in the right hand side we use the infinitesimal action of on . The description of the tractor connection in terms of the fundamental derivative used in the proof of Lemma   then readily implies that is parallel along the projection of . Since any tangent vector on can be realized as such a projection, we get and the result follows.  Now of course we also get a global parallel trivialization of in the case that is a connected open subset in . In this case is the (open) pre–image of in . Now assume that is a PCS–quotient, and let be the corresponding infinitesimal automorphism. Since any infinitesimal automorphism corresponds to a parallel section of , we see that must be the restriction to of a right invariant vector field on . From the proof of Lemma   above, we see that the corresponding bundle map on satisfies . Now let be the kernel and the cokernel of the map defined by . Then of course mapping to defines a trivialization and similarly we get a trivialization of .    Suppose that is a connected open subset of the homogeneous model of some parabolic contact structure and that is a PCS–quotient for which the infinitesimal automorphism defining the quotient corresponds to . Let be a representation of , let be the action of and put and .  \(1) For the complex from Proposition  , the cohomology is given by , where is the –th de–Rham cohomology of .  \(2) Suppose further that . Then there is a natural isomorphism and also for the complex from Proposition  , the cohomology is given by . Moreover, under this identification and the one from part (1), the homomorphism in the long exact sequence from Theorem   corresponds to map is given by taking the wedge product with the cohomology class , where is characterized by .  The global trivialization constructed above of course defines an isomorphism By definition, the map corresponds to under this isomorphism while corresponds to . Moreover, the fact that the trivializing frame consists of parallel sections implies that corresponds to under the isomorphism . Finally, the considerations about naturality of from Section   together with the observations on the trivializing sections above show that corresponds to under the isomorphism .  Now by definition consists of those forms such that , and . Hence we see restricting the above map, we obtain an isomorphism between and the joint kernel of , and . Of course, this joint kernel is exactly , and corresponds to , so (1) follows.  In the setting of (2), we first observe that restricting the projection to , we obtain an injection by assumption, so this must be a linear isomorphism for dimensional reasons. Now we can compose the isomorphism with the projection onto and restrict the resulting map to . By the above observations on compatibility, the values of this map lie in the kernels of and , so we actually land in .  Moreover, by assumption, any form in can be written as , where has values in while has values in . From above, we see that preserves these two subspaces, so we see that if and only if for . The same result trivially holds for so we see that implies for , so in particular . Again by assumption restricts to an isomorphism on , which shows that , so the class of in coincides with the class of .  On the other hand, given and , we can find an element projecting onto and the consider . Since , we see that this lies in , so we can look at its class in . Together with the above, this shows that we get an inverse, so . Of course, , and since the pullback is horizontal, this coincides with . Hence under our isomorphism on again corresponds to .

  <outline text="Examples" _note="Let us first observe that the conditions of part (2) of Theorem   are often satisfied.    Let be a simple Lie algebra with complexification and suppose that is semisimple, i.e. such that is diagonalizable on . Then the assumption of part (2) of Theorem   is satisfied for any finite dimensional representation of .  It is a classical result of Lie theory that acts diagonalizably on any complex representation of . But for a diagonalizable map, the kernel is the eigenspace for the eigenvalue , while the image coincides with the sum of all other eigenspaces. Hence on such representations, and via complexifications, this easily extends to all real representations of .  Next, we can sort out the local case.    Suppose that the assumptions of part (2) of Theorem   are satisfied and that has the property that the form such that is exact. Then for each , the cohomology in degree of the descended BGG sequence fits into an exact sequence In particular, the local cohomology of the complex vanishes except in degrees and , where it is isomorphic to .  Part (2) of Theorem   gives an interpretation of the cohomology groups of and showing up in the long exact sequence from Theorem   and shows that the connecting homomorphisms in that sequence are all . Hence the sequence decomposes into short exact sequences as claimed. The result on local cohomology follows readily.  Finally, we can sort of the case of complex projective space in either of the two interpretations from . Note that the only information needed for the applications in is vanishing of the first cohomology for a class of descended BGG sequences.    For consider the global PCS–quotient , either for the PCS–structure of Kähler type on as discussed in Proposition 1 of or the induced conformal Fedosov structure as in Section 3.4 of that reference. Let be a representation of the corresponding group , let be the element generating the parallel section of giving rise to the PCS–quotient and put . Let be the tractor bundle induced by .  Then the cohomology of the sequence of differential operators on obtained by descending the BGG sequence induced by vanishes in degrees different from and , while in degrees and it is isomorphic to .  The Lie algebra of either equals or . In the first case, naturally acts on and in the second case we consider it as acting on . In both cases, the discussion in shows that acts diagonalizably (over ) in this representation. Thus we can apply Proposition   to see that the assumptions of part (2) of Theorem   are satisfied for . Together with the well known description of , Theorem   shows that both and have vanishing cohomology in odd degrees. Moreover, all the connecting homomorphisms in the long exact sequence from Theorem   are isomorphisms whenever . Using this, the long exact sequence readily implies vanishing of the cohomology of in degrees different from and . For these two degrees the long exact sequence contains the parts and which together with Theorem   completes the proof.">
