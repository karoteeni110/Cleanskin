    <title>Is the colour-octet mechanism consistent with the double production
measurement at B-factories?</title>
    <abstract>Double production in collisions involving colour-octet channels are
evaluated up to order . Having implemented the variation of the
parameters (, and long-distance matrix elements), we found that the
cross sections for producing double at B-factories range from fb to fb,
which are even much smaller than that via the colour-siglet mechanism.
Accordingly, this result is consistent with the measurement by the Belle
and BABAR Collaborations. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The phenomenological study on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective theory  is making new progress since the LHC started its running. Copious data not only provides evidences for the colour-octet (CO) mechanism, but also indicates challenges to the theory. In addition to the fact that the hadroproduction data can be well reproduced by the theoretical evaluations within the NRQCD framework , hadroproduction  gives another strong support. In low transverse momentum () region, even though the factorization might not hold, the colour-glass-condensate model  associated with NRQCD  did a good job in the description of the production in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions . Despite all the successes, we can not overlook the challenges it is facing. The universality of the NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) has not yet been suggested in all the processes. As an example, the constraint  on the CO LDMEs indicated by the QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) study on the production at B factories is apparently below the LDME values obtained through the fit of the production data at other colliders . The perspectives of the long-standing polarization puzzle still have not converged. Three groups  achieved the calculation of the polarization at hadron colliders at QCD NLO; however, with different LDMEs, their results are complete different from one another. Recently, the hadroproduction was measured by the LHCb Collaboration , which provides another laboratory for the study of NRQCD. Ref.  considers it as a challenge to NRQCD, while Refs.  found these data are consistent with the hadroproduction measurements. Further, with the constraint on the LDMEs obtained in Ref. , Ref.  discovered some interesting features of the polarization, and found a possibility of understanding the polarization within the NRQCD framework.  The pair production at B factories is another challenge that NRQCD is facing. Belle  and BABAR  Collaborations observed the process Charmonium, and found no evidence for the pair events, while the QCD leading order (LO) calculation based on the colour-siglet (CS) mechanism predicted a significant production rate . This was understood by the QCD NLO corrections , which contribute a negative value and cancel the large LO cross sections. Ref.  only talked about the CS contributions. However, the Belle and BABAR measurements actually did not exclude the double plus light hadron events. Both of the experiments measured the spectrum, where denotes the invariant mass of all the final states except for the fully reconstructed . These distributions exhibited no significant excess in the range of about 300 MeV above the mass, which suggested that the cross section for the pair plus light hadron (e.g. , ) associated production is also too small to observe. To accord with NRQCD, the double production cross sections involving the CO channels must not be significant, which, however, is not manifest. Although suppressed by the CO LDMEs, the double yield due to the CO mechanism is enhanced by the powers of , relative to via the CS channels. As is pointed out in Refs. , at B factories, double can be produced via two virtual photons generated through the annihilation, and the LO contribution is of order . In contrast, as illustrated in FIG.( ,  , and  ), the diagrams for the processes e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(m\_1)+c|[c]{}(m\_2),   when and have the opposite charge conjugation, involve only a single virtual photon, and the LO contribution is of order . For double production, and have only two possible configurations, which are and , and and . These two processes are suppressed by the CO LDMEs by a factor of , where is the typical charm-quark velocity in the charmonium rest frame, however, enhanced by the coupling constants by a factor of , relative to via the CS channels. The double can also be produced through such kind of processes, e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(n\_1)+c|[c]{}(n\_2)+g,   where denotes a gluon. When and (or equivalently and ), this kind of processes are enhanced by the coupling constants by a factor of and reduced by the CO LDME by a factor of , relative to the processes involving only the CS channels. In sum, the processes involving CO states are enhanced by a synthetic factor of about , comparing with the processes considered in Refs. , the LO cross sections of which is large enough to be observed by Belle and BABAR experiments. Accordingly, we need to calculate the cross sections for the pair production involving the CO channels to see whether NRQCD can endure this paradox.  In this work, we will present a comprehensive study on the double production in annihilation involving CO channels up to order , and check whether it is consistent with the meausurements by Belle and BABAR Collaborations. The plus production at B factories has already been studied in Refs. , and their results do not contradict the double measurements by Belle and BABAR Collaborations, regarding the branching ratios , 33.9, 19.2 . In this paper, we do not calculate the production. We also notice that the may come from the feed down, where the can be produced via the channel. By employing the LDMEs obtained in Refs. , and in association with the branching ratios listed above, we find that this contribution is much smaller than that from the directly produced through the channel. Similarly, the production cross sections via the feed down is also smaller than that for the directly produced ones. For this reason, we completely omit the discussions on the feed down contributions from both and .  The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Sec. , we outline the formalism of the calculation. Sec.  presents the numerical results and related discussions, followed by a concluding remark in Sec. .">

<outline text="Double  production in NRQCD framework" _note="Following the NRQCD factorization, the total cross sections for the pair production can be expressed as (e\^+e\^-J/+J/+X)=\_[n\_1,n\_2]{}(e\^+e\^-c(n\_1)+c(n\_2)+X)O\^[J/]{}(n\_1)O\^[J/]{}(n\_2),   where , run over all the possible configurations of the intermediate states with certain colour and angular momentum, is the short-distance coefficient (SDC), and and are the corresponding LDMEs. When at least one of and is a CO state, the LO contributions are of order . At this order, all the processes have the form of Eq.( ), in which the only possible configurations of and are , and , , and the representative Feynman diagrams are illustrated in Fig.( ,  , and  ). At QCD NLO (), in addition to the virtual corrections (the representative Feynman diagrams for which are shown in Fig.( ,  , and  )) to the processes presented in Eq.( ), double states in association with a gluon production is also required for consideration, as illustrated in Eq.( ). The real-correction processes to the LO ones are e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+g,\ e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+g,   in addition to which, five processes are also at this order, as listed below, and will be calculated in our paper. e\^+e\^-c(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+ c(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+g,  \ e\^+e\^-c(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+ c(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+g,  \ e\^+e\^-c(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+ c(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+g,  \ e\^+e\^-c(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+ c(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+g,  \ e\^+e\^-c(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+ c(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+g.   The representatvie Feynman diagrams for the final-state-gluon-emission processes are presented in Fig.( ,  , and  ). However, not all the processes have the three types of diagrams. So, we summarize the possible diagrams for each of the processes in Table .     \ \ \  Before we present the numerical results, we first address the divergences rising from the processes listed above. First of all, the LO processes are divergence free, and we denote their total cross sections as . The virtual corrections to contain both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) divergences. The UV divergences can be eliminated through the renormalization precedure, while the IR divergences will be canceled by those emerging in the real corrections, the processes for which are presented in Eq.( ). We denote the renormalized virtual-correction total cross sections as , and the real corrections to as . The complete QCD NLO corrections to can be expressed as \^[NLO]{}\^V+\^R=\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{}+\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{},   where \^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{}=\^V\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{}+\^R\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{},\ \^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{}=\^V\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{}+\^R\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{}.   Both and are divergence free. The total cross sections for the pair production through and channels are the sum of their LO and NLO contributions. \_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{}=\^[LO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{}+\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}]{},\ \_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{}=\^[LO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{}+\^[NLO]{}\_[\^3S\_1\^[ ]{}+\^3P\_J\^[ ]{}]{}.   Note that we adopt the on-shell (OS) renormalization scheme for the renormalization of c-quark mass and the wave functions of the c-quark and gluon, and modified-mininum-subtraction () scheme for that of the QCD coupling constant, which are coincide with Ref. . The corresponding renormalization constants, (for the c-quark mass), (for the c-quark wave function), (for the gluon wave function), and (for the QCD coupling constant), are &amp;&amp;Z\^[OS]{}\_[m]{}=-3C\_[F]{} ,\ &amp;&amp;Z\^[OS]{}\_[2]{}=-C\_[F]{} ,\ &amp;&amp;Z\^[OS]{}\_[3]{}= ,\ &amp;&amp;Z\^\_[g]{}=- , where is the renormalization scale, is Euler’s constant, is the one-loop coefficient of the QCD beta function, is the number of active quark flavors. In SU(3), color factors are given by , , , and , where is the number of light quark flavors. Actually, in the NLO total amplitude level, the terms proportion to cancel each other; thus the result is independent of the renormalization scheme of the gluon field. The cross sections for the processes listed in Eq.(  and  ) also have divergences, which, however, can be eliminated through the renormalization of the SDCs for them. We take process   as an example. The cancellation of its divergences requires the calculation of the NLO corrections to . The bare LDME can be expressed as O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})\_[bare]{}=O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})- (-)O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[ ]{}),   where is the c-quark mass, and for SU(3) gauge theory. Here we adopt the -cutoff renormalization scheme  to subtract the UV divergence. By substituting the relation between the bare and renormalized LDMEs, O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})\_[bare]{}&amp;=&amp;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})\_[renorm]{}+\ &amp;&amp;(-\_E++ln())O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[ ]{}),   into Eq.( ), we obtain the renormalized LDME as O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})\_[renorm]{}&amp;=&amp;O\^[J/]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})-\ &amp;&amp;(-\_E++ln())O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[ ]{}).   Then process contribute an additional divergent term \_[div]{}(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}))=-(-\_E++ln())\ (e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{}))O\^[J/]{}(\^3P\_0\^[ ]{}),   which cancels the IR sigularities rising from process  . In this sense, we can redefine the SDC for process   as \_[renorm]{}(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+g)=(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+g)\ -(-\_E++ln())(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^3S\_1\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})),   where (e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_J\^[ ]{})+g)=(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_0\^[ ]{})+g)\ +3(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_1\^[ ]{})+g)+5(e\^+e\^-c|[c]{}(\^1S\_0\^[ ]{})+c|[c]{}(\^3P\_2\^[ ]{})+g)   has been implicated in Eq.( ) (the same convention applies to the SDCs with the subscript “renorm”). is a finite quantity, therefore, we can replace, in Eq.( ), the divergent one by it. The same operation can be done for process   as well. Then, we denote all the divergence-free total cross sections for the processes listed in Eq.( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) as , where and are the corresponding states.">

<outline text="Numerical results" _note="In our analytic calculation, we use our [MATHEMATICA]{} package with the employment of FeynArts , FeynCalc , FIRE  and Apart . As a cross check, we also compute the processes using the FDC package , except for process  . To subtract the IR divergences in the gluon-emission processes, we adopt the two-cutoff slicing strategy . The independence of the cutoff has been checked.  We have the following global choices of the parameters in our calculation: , and the colliding energy of the electron and positron is . The mass is fixed to to keep the gauge invariance. The default values of and the renormalization scale () are and , respectively. Since we investigate the dependence of the total cross sections, the two-loop running is employed in our computation. The values of the SDCs for all the processes are listed in Table  , where the SDCs for the channels are defined by multiplying a factor of to those defined in Ref. , in order to keep the homogeneity of the dimensions (for double production, this factor should be ). The LO SDCs for and productions are and , respectively.

The total cross section for double production at B factories up to order is the sum of those for different channels. Note that the two processes which are symmetric in the sense of switching and are only counted once to avoid the double counting. We obtain this value as . Compared with the results obtained in Ref. , it is even smaller than that via the CS channels up to QCD NLO.  To investigate the uncertainties brought in by the two scales, we vary from 1.2 to 1.7 and from to and calculate the corresponding total cross sections. When one of these scales varies its value, the other is fixed. Note that the LDMEs used in our calculation are obtained with the configuration . When investigating the dependence, we need to take the scaling rule, , into account.  The total cross section as a function of charm quark mass is presented in Fig. . We can see that the and channels provide the largest contributions, while the others contribute smaller with visible hierachy. Expecially, both the and cross sections are negative . The total cross section increases from about 0.08 to about 0.12 fb as the increases from to . The dependence of the total cross section is presented in Fig. , and the decreases from 0.104 to 0.08 as increases from to . The dependence on the two scales is not severe, which indicates good convergence of the perturbative expansion.  Since there are several parallel extractions of the LDMEs, we need to investigate the uncertainties brought in by the different values of them. As is shown in TABLE , the total cross sections obtained by using the LDMEs in Ref.  are almost twice of ours, however, still too small to be observed by the experiment.">
