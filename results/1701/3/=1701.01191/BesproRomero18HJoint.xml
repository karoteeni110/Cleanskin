    <title> Heavy quarks within the electroweak multiplet</title>
    <abstract>Standard-model fields and their associated electroweak Lagrangian are
equivalently expressed in a shared spin basis. The scalar-vector terms
are written with scalar-operator components acting on quark-doublet
elements, and shown to be parametrization-invariant. Such terms, and the
t- and b-quark Yukawa terms are linked by the identification of the
common mass-generating Higgs operating upon the other fields, after
acquiring a vacuum expectation value . Thus, the customary vector masses
are related to the fermions’, fixing the t-quark mass with the relation
either for maximal hierarchy, or given the b-quark mass , implying GeV,
for GeV. A sum rule is derived for all quark masses that generalizes
this restriction. An interpretation follows that electroweak bosons and
heavy quarks belong in a multiplet. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The standard model (SM) describes elementary-particle features and their interactions, which is praiseworthy, given its relatively limited required input, consisting of specific gauge and flavor symmetries, representations, and parameters, yet aspects remain within the model whose origin and connection to other tenets is absent, and that need to be addressed.  Thus, among its successes, the SM predicts mass values for the W and Z bosons that carry the short-range electroweak interaction, in terms of electroweak parameters, through the Higgs mechanism. However, one salient SM problem is that the fermion sector and its masses remain arbitrary, as they arise from Lagrangian terms, independent from the boson elements.  The electroweak sector hints it may provide this link, given that the W and Z vectors have universal couplings to SM fermions, and the Higgs field collectively gives mass to fermions and bosons. In addition, the similar order of magnitude of the measured masses of the W, Z, the recently discovered scalar excitation, associated with the Higgs, and the top quark (with the bottom quark’s the next highest), suggests connections among them, and thus, a common energy scale. Furthermore, fermions occupy the spin-1/2 and fundamental representations of the Lorentz and scalar groups, respectively, as vector bosons belong to the adjoint representation of each group,[^1][^2] which implies bosons can be constructed in terms of fermions, suggesting composite structures and/or a common origin. The above motivates looking for a formalism that takes account of discrete degrees of freedom in a single basis, including group representation properties, such as the fermion-boson fundamental-adjoint duality for the Lorentz-scalar representations, and that describes the combined action of operators on fields.  A previously proposed SM extension, based on a shared extended spin space, with a matrix formalism, satisfies these requirements, as it replicates SM fields with their features, and matrix multiplication accounts for operator action on fields. This space contains a (3+1)-dimensional   subspace and one beyond 3+1, linked, respectively, to Lorentz and scalar degrees of freedom. At each dimension, a finite number of Lorentz-invariant partitions are generated with specific symmetries and representations, reproducing particular SM features, where the cases with dimension 5+1, 7+1, and 9+1 were studied.  In this connection, it is worth recalling that a basis or representation choice can be useful, even essential, in the description of a system and its dynamics. It may reveal otherwise-hidden connections between its components, and provide a simpler framework to understand physical properties. Such a basis may describe effective degrees of freedom accounting for collective interactions, allowing for a simpler near free-particle description, in a first approximation. For example, nucleon and associated boson interactive configurations give a tractable account of nuclear-motion modes. Within condensed matter and low-temperature superconducting systems, a residual attractive interaction related to phonons couple electrons into Cooper pairs, which propagate freely, and lead to frictionless currents. In an application of this theory to quantum field theory and elementary particles, a four-fermion interaction produces fermion and composite-boson masses, linking their values. The quark model conceives mesons and baryons in terms of constituent (dressed) quarks.  Leaving aside the more speculative nature of the spin SM extension, but complementarily to it, in this paper, we use it as a basis to derive SM connections, and the fields’ mass values in particular: SM heavy-fermion (), vector (), and scalar () fields are equivalently expressed in terms of the obtained common basis for both Lorentz and electroweak degrees of freedom, in turn, recasting their Lagrangian components ; the identification of the scalar operator within the and vertices links univocally its defining (mass) parameters. Indeed, such universal electroweakly-invariant terms lead, under the Higgs mechanism, to a scalar whose lowest-energy condensate state pervades space, and generates particle masses through its vacuum expectation value . Within the spin basis, this mechanism is similarly represented; as these fields shape elements on a matrix space, with a single associated scalar operator acting upon the others, their mass-generation property relates their coefficients.  Next, as we give the paper’s organization, we sketch the argument in more detail. Section 2 reviews the applied spin-extended space for symmetry generators and states. The paper focuses then on the (7+1)-d case that can describe the electroweak sector, and a quark doublet. For all sectors, , , , the conventional and spin-space Lagrangian are equivalent, which is shown term-by-term in Appendices 1,2. Section 3 chooses one among two vector bases within , where vectors with chiral properties are adequate. Section 4 writes equivalently with combinations of the scalars and their conjugates, with universal couplings to vectors, shown explicitly in Appendix 2; similarly for the spin-base representation, in which these two scalars induce a projection to flavor-doublet components (as t,b quarks). Schematically, given the spin-space basis element for a field , we write in terms of containing these two scalar components, obtaining the vector mass squared within as . In Section 5, we show that the fermion masses within can be written , where contains two terms with appropriate Yukawa coefficients. Within the spin-basis formalism, we derive that , have the same operator structure; given their mass-giving nature, the identification of these operators and their coefficients translates a -normalization restriction on to , implying a relation for the t and b quark masses. Section 6 shows a procedure exists that generalizes consistently this relation to all quarks in terms of a sum rule for their masses, taking advantage of the chiral projection properties of the scalar field in the spin basis. In Section 7, we draw conclusions. We work in the classical framework afforded by the Lagrangian, and at tree-level, but also rely on a quantum-mechanical interpretation.

Under the assumption of a [SINGLE]{} mass-producing field operator, we match a reparameterized in Eq.   that gives the Z mass, to the fermion-mass term , in Eq.  , resulting in ; a multiplet structure is suggested. In other words, the operator identification derives from their mass eigenvalues, expressed schematically as and , and the proportionality constant is derived accordingly. In this association, the simple real-field nature justifies its use (similarly for each , as opposed to the complex . Similarly, Eq.   is chosen over Eq.  , as the latter adds the Higgs conjugate representation, unlike the SM. Thus, the vacuum expectation value reproduces the parameterization in Eq.  , and identifies , as Yukawa parameters: The same argument can be made using the second scalar form in Eq.  , as it also leads to Eq.  . This results in Using Eq.  , we obtain the relation for the , quark masses The commutator arrangement in Eq.   is used in the above comparison; as it is set on the demand of a normalized scalar, the argument strengthens on the use of the same Z operator acting on fermions in Eq.  . The coefficient matching in derives from the underlying freedom of choice in , and, in turn, from the underlying three-parameter - symmetry that can be equally implemented in the spin basis. Looking at the matrix structure, the operator within makes it a rank-2 reducible-representation operator, as expressed in Eq.   and can be read in Eq.  ; indeed, connects two fermion spin polarizations, but hits a single W state’s components twice as duplicates the scalar representations, requiring the normalization factor. In yet another interpretation, this relation is obtained from the normalization restriction in the Yukawa term in Eq.  , dividing out the energy scale set by the vacuum expectation. To the extent that these arguments rely on a common metric vector space, they are geometric.  Equation   assumes the parity-conserving condition, constraining the quark masses.[^1] For maximal hierarchy, with , dependence on [ONE ]{} comparable large scale O(O(), (,) we get , for GeV, ; alternatively, the quark-b mass input predicts the top quark-mass as GeV, for GeV (while renormalization effects give GeV.)

<outline text="Extended quark-mass relation" _note="We place the heavy-quark mass relation in Eq.   in the larger SM context, and argue for a plausible generalization for all quarks, based on it. For these purposes, we first derive some SM field properties using the spin basis, assuming they can be also derived within the conventional SM basis, given their equivalent application. Needless to say, we demand consistency with the SM, and with experiment. At the Section’s end we identify some underlaying general assumptions.  Thus, we concentrate on the SM three-generation subset of the (7+1)-d model, as can be effected by the Yukawa operators in Eq.  . Eq.   uses that the same single-scalar operator acts on the fermions and the vector bosons: such an operator is reproduced in the and terms, as the term admits a basis expression that applies the associated -symmetries in Section 4. This connection implies the equivalent expression that can be read from the Appendices, which shows separation of quark u- and d-type components, depending on scalars, and no mixing among them. We focus on the mass-generating scalar elements corresponding to the neutral , , from Eqs.  ,  , and their hermitian conjugates. As mass relations are considered, we assume fields after the Higgs mechanism is applied.  In particular, a connection emerges between the normalized bilinear Higgs term that gives masses to the vector bosons, as the Z mass in Eq.  , and the fermions. where is defined in Eq.  , , , , , are quarks at rest, defined in Table  , , are , coefficients, as given in Eq.  , in the second equality we use the trace property, and the third expresses the normalization condition. Factor 2 comes as only one spin fermion component is used. Thus, elements can be written as a sum of inner products between Yukawa and SM scalar components. This relation derives from the projective nature of Higgs normal and dual terms, accompanied by a fermion chirality operator in , in Eq.  . Eq.   can also be understood from the substitutions in with terms extracted from in Eq.  , using the trace permutation property. The identity in each substitution provides the link to the t, b Yukawa constants for the doublet, singlet cases. The arguments leading to the mass relation in Eq.   imply , , as given in Eq.  , namely, a diagonal mass basis is assumed.  Since one can pick any fermion generation on Tables  ,  , the interpretation of the , coefficients as Yukawa constants within the term leads to a generalization to other families and non-diagonal Yukawa elements. We now consider the extension of in Eqs.   and   with a fermion expansion that uses all Yukawa coefficients, where the Yukawa operators from Eq.   are necessary to connect the u- and d-type quark fields defined in Eq.  , and , are Yukawa coefficients, with the up, down, charm and strange quarks, also included, relabelling singlets , and doublets .  The allowed Yukawa terms, diagonal and mixed, can be included using all combinations of a 3-generation set of normalized fermions on Table  , where a projection operator as in Eq.   is applied. We evaluate the trace of bilinear , terms with components, extending Eq.  , producing which may be also obtained by the substitution of the associated scalar coefficients in bilinear neutral Higgs terms The correspondence of in Eqs.   and   to in Eq.   induces the sum of square mass-matrix elements in Eq.  , which is equal (given the property , a matrix, its diagonal form) to the sum over the square masses, A generalization with such a sum is induced, similar to relation Eq.  , with the Higgs normalization condition, Eq.  . Since Eq.   maintains the same structure as Eq.  , following the generalization of to , Implicitly, we used the -fermion symmetry, namely, no fermion preference. With today’s uncertainties in the quark-mass values, this relation is phenomenologically consistent with Eq.  , as the same maximal hierarchy or quark b-mass input argument follows, and the rest of the quarks have comparably negligible masses. As this relation is independent of the mass diagonalization matrix, it is also of the CKM matrix.  The two quark-mass conditions in Eqs.   and   are interpreted. This paper shows SM features support a boson and fermion connection leading to the t,b quark mass condition in Eq.  . If only such quarks belong in the same class as the other massive SM bosons, a different mass-generating mechanism is expected for the other fermions; one concludes that they are not affected by such dynamics, as their masses are comparably negligible. On the other hand, if there is a common dynamics, as suggested by the similar fermion-boson inner product, the all-quark condition Eq.   applies, given the fermion symmetry, and the structure similarity between Eq.   and Eq.  .  Initial fermion states within the 3-generation set for in Eq.   remain within such a subspace, given the commuting property of the projection operator in Eq.   with baryon-number, Lorentz, gauge and mass operators (, , , , .) In other words, within the 3-generation subset of states, the substitution in is valid. This implies that no operator will connect the initial fermions outside the 3 generations. So is the case for the 3-generation extension of in Eq.  , requiring a sum over the (electroweak) flavors. We conclude the 3-generation spin-basis projection consistently describes the SM.  By construction, Eqs.  ,   imply masses represent O() corrections. This is also the order of the Hamiltonian needed to obtain the other fermion masses. More assumptions are necessary to get further information on masses, and CKM matrix elements. For example, hierarchy arguments on the masses’ order of magnitude difference were derived that explain how the associated W,Z,t,b, large scale mostly cancels for the other fermions at the vertical level (within a doublet) and horizontal level (between families). This leads to a consistent description in which such mechanisms coexist with the Higgs-generated one. While we produce above further consistency arguments for their parameters, more stringent constraints from the (7+1)-d will be tested elsewhere. Other arguments leading to hierarchy exist as textures.  We conclude Yukawa coefficients, contained in rest fermions as a device, connect to bilinear scalar combinations containing mass-generating Higgs terms in , keeping the Lorentz or gauge structure of unmodified, and ultimately consistently with the SM. We show above in Eq.   induces a generalized sum rule for the square quark masses in Eq.  . The latter is a plausible extension of Eq.  , based on a subset of terms, after the Higgs mechanism.

<outline text="Conclusions and Outlook" _note="In summary, the formalism used places fields on a basis that simultaneously contains SM bosons and fermions. and terms are linked through the mass rendering of the scalar operator within them, using the electroweak vertex independence of its components acting on different fermion-doublet elements, implicitly expected, but which we now expose. Supporting a SM prediction of a unique scalar, input from the normalized scalar-vector vertex, and the mass-parameter interpretation in the vertex, relates and , cf Eq.  , the main result in the paper. The same relation can be argued by considering the scalar operator’s matrix rank, or assuming normalized Yukawa components. Based on chiral properties, the same Higgs-operator rule, and a correspondence between fermion-boson inner products and Yukawa terms, a plausible extended sum rule for the fermion square masses is proposed, given in Eq.  . Both relations are consistent with the SM, given today’s particle-mass uncertainties. We conclude the spin basis is a useful platform to obtain, within the SM, the quark-mass electroweak relations.  The central argument input can be also read when terms in , attached with the projector in Eq.  , are carried into the intermediate chiral version in Eq.   and, after the 1/2 factor cancellation in its mass component, relate to terms in the Yukawa . The spin-basis gives it further support as it classifies discrete degrees and produces SM features. Thus, the matrix space restricts representations, in turn, exhausting the space; electroweak fields belong to the adjoint, and , fields to the fundamental representations. Additionally, the chiral property in the electroweak term, associated to , translates naturally to the interaction components. Normalized fields define the Lagrangian terms, setting the trace coefficient, and the stage for the , comparison. In the spin-basis context, the field’s chiral property is nominal, but consistent, as contains the projector from , and within , acts on chiral fermion components.  The scalar operator acting on vectors and fermions links their matrix elements, connecting parameters. The particles’ simultaneous participation in mass generation through the Higgs mechanism and related SM vertices, with assigned representations, implies a description with common dynamics, and at a given energy scale, already at the classical level, and suggests fields belong in a multiplet, supporting a common-origin unification assumption.  It follows that the arguments provide a geometric approach to address problems as the electroweak-symmetry breaking origin. The formalism facilitates the fields’ composite description, as boson degrees of freedom may be written in terms of two fermions’. Expansions in such fields may be useful, independently of whether compositeness is physical or only a device.  Naturalness is hinted at in the , associated single scale, which produces a hierarchy effect. Thus, while this symmetry-breaking effect applies for heavy-quark masses, it could be valid also horizontally between generations in accordance with the fermions’ low masses. While here we considered the top-quark mass, the other fermions, besides the b-quark, may be included in this scheme, namely, considering bilinear fermion components for scalar particles, but they will have little influence on this result, as their interaction is proportional to their masses.  As the spin basis connects the vector and quark sectors, constraints may be derived for SM extensions as supersymmetry, composite models that require dynamical symmetry breaking as technicolor or, in an extension of such models, top and bottom quarks that conform condensate-producing massive particles.  Besides the fields’ spin representation connecting the scalar operator in two vertices, it highlights chiral components of particles and interactions that maintain their SM equivalence. Indeed, we showed two such valid chiral and non-chiral scalar bases for the Lagrangian. This freedom could be clarified in other vertices, as with a SM extension with additional scalar degrees of freedom, whereas in this paper, we considered only their SM projection.  [99]{}  S. L.

<outline text="Appendix 1: Fermion-vector  fermion-scalar  Lagrangians" _note="In this Appendix we show the Lagrangians’ equivalence in the conventional and spin bases by considering explicit expressions with accompanying wave functions (or fields). With hindsight, we use the same Lagrangian label in both bases.  First, we use an iterative procedure  to obtain a (7+1)-d representation. Starting with the Pauli matrices , and , we get the -d representation  then, the -d representation  and finally, the -d representation  The commuting property of the Lorentz and scalar symmetry operators implies that they can be represented as a tensor product. To compare with the spin-space basis, we write the conventional-basis generators as tensor products, choosing the (7+1)-d space to represent them; thus the spin-1/2 and SU(2) terms, expressed by the Clifford basis, and Pauli matrices, respectively, generalize to, e.g., and , with the 3-Pauli matrix, and corresponding spin and weak isospin unit operators , , respectively.  Similarly, states in the conventional basis can be obtained that are represented in (7+1)-d space. For example, a left-handed (L), spin-1/2 polarization (1), top (T), state satisfies    .  Eq. 36 in the paper implies spinors are labeled by the spin operator in the Dirac representation , and the weak SU(L) component. While most of the results in the paper are representation-independent, a unitary transformation may be applied to the (7+1)-d matrices to show the conventional-basis description used in Eq. 36 in the paper. Indeed, has a Dirac form with the unitary transformation with (actually, it exchanges and .) and is represented, after the unitary transformation , by   Next, we write all the conventional-basis states in this basis, and their association to the spin-extended basis states, with corresponding quantum numbers (notation used in Table 4 and Ref. 7, written inbetween):   where the spin-basis states are shown [IN EXTENSO]{} in Tables 2 and 3.  For the fermion wave functions , we use polar coordinates, where the conventional and spin terms contain, respectively, for quarks , with spin components , and chirality . The magnitude part can be shown to be the same for both cases, as can be derived by comparing, e. g., the mass term. The vectors , are real fields.  The phases appear in each term in both bases. For example, for the conventional basis and for the two polarizations within the left-handed hypercharge SU(2)-doublet, we use the association with applied to transform back from the Dirac representation, and we used the terms in Eqs. (4) and (5) in this Appendix; for the spin basis, .  The Lagrangians’ identity is shown, by checking that the same terms are reproduced in both bases, and finding independent constant phases that connect the two representations. In the following, we present the fermion-vector Lagrangian components: interactive (weak and hypercharge), kinetic; also the fermion-scalar (Yukawa) Lagrangian. The subtitle contains the two-basis Lagrangian expressions in a concise notation, and then one component is given in an expanded form; the equations that link the phases in the two representations are written as they derive from the terms.">
