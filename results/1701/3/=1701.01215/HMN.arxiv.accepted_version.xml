<outline text="Introduction" _note="In this paper we consider the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for viscous incompressible flows around a rotating obstacle in two-dimensions: Here and are respectively unknown velocity field and pressure field, and is a given external force. The time dependent domain is defined as where is an exterior domain in with a smooth compact boundary, while the real number represents the rotation speed of the obstacle . We use the standard notation for derivatives: , , , , . The vector denotes the perpendicular: . The system describes the flow around the obstacle which rotates with a constant angular velocity , and the condition on the boundary represents the no-slip boundary condition. To remove the difficulty due to the time dependence of the fluid domain it is more convenient to analyze the system in the reference frame: for and , Here denotes the transpose of a matrix . Then is equivalent with the equations in the time-independent domain : In this paper we are interested in the stationary solutions to this system. Thus we assume that is independent of and consider the next system To state our result let us introduce the function spaces used in this paper. As usual, the class is defined as the set of smooth divergence free vector fields with compact support in , and the homogeneous space is the closure of with respect to the norm . For a fixed number we also introduce the weighted space and its subspace as follows. These are Banach spaces equipped with the natural norm and the set of functions with compact support is dense in . Moreover, for any bounded sequence in (or ) with for some , there exists a subsequence which converges in the weak-star topology in the sense that there is (or , respectively) such that and . We denote by the set of functions which belong to for any compact set , and , , is defined in the similar manner.  The main result of this paper is stated as follows.    There exists such that the following statement holds. Assume that is of the form with some and . If and then there exists a solution to , which is unique in a suitable class of functions (see Theorem   for the precise description). If in addition, then the solution behaves as where Here , , denotes the Cauchy stress tensor, and is the outward unit normal vector to .  \(i) The smallness condition on and in can be slightly weakened with respect to the dependence on ; see Theorem   for details.  \(ii) Both conditions and are critical in view of scaling. Note that the summability is needed only for the antisymmetric part of . These conditions are not enough to ensure that behaves like the circular flow as , and the additional decay condition as in Theorem   is required to achieve this asymptotic property.  \(iii) The second term of the right-hand side of is well-defined if and . If possesses an additional decay such as with then the order in is replaced by at least when and given data are further small depending on . The precise statement on this result is stated in Theorem  .  \(iv) The pressure is determined uniquely up to a constant and belongs to . Then, since , the coefficient in is well-defined.  \(v) In Theorem   we assume that the external force is of divergence form. In fact, this is not an essential assumption, and it is possible to deal with the external force satisfying with the smallness in these norms, and the asymptotic expansion is verified if in addition. This is obtained by using the recent result by the authors in the whole space which solves the linearized problem for satisfying . Although this result is not so trivial since the condition is just in the scale-critical regime, we focus only on of divergence form in this paper, for the argument becomes shorter due to the fact that the nonlinear term is also written in the divergence form as .  As far as the authors know, Theorem   is the first general existence result of the flows around a rotating obstacle [IN THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE]{}. Before stating the idea of the proof of Theorem  , let us recall some known results on the mathematical analysis of flows around a rotating obstacle.  So far the mathematical results on this topic have been obtained mainly for the three-dimensional problem, as listed below. For the nonstationary problem the existence of global weak solutions is proved by Borchers , and the unique existence of time-local regular solutions is shown by Hishida and Geissert, Heck, and Hieber , while the global strong solutions for small data are obtained by Galdi and Silvestre . The spectrum of the linear operator related to this problem is studied by Farwig and Neustupa ; see also the linear analysis by Hishida . The existence of stationary solutions to the associated system is proved in , Silvestre , Galdi , and Farwig and Hishida . In particular, in the stationary flows with the decay order are obtained, while the work of is based on the weak framework, which is another natural scale-critical space for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Our Theorem   is considered as a two-dimensional counterpart of the three-dimensional result of . In D case the asymptotic profiles of these stationary flows at spatial infinity are studied by Farwig and Hishida and Farwig, Galdi, and Kyed , where it is proved that the asymptotic profiles are described by the Landau solutions, stationary self-similar solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in . It is worthwhile to mention that, also in the two-dimensional case, the asymptotic profile is given by the stationary self-similar solution , as is shown in Theorem  . The stability of the above stationary solutions has been well studied in the three-dimensional case; The global stability is proved in , and the local stability is obtained by Hishida and Shibata .  All results mentioned above are in the three-dimensional case, while only a few results are known so far for the flow around a rotating obstacle in the two-dimensional case. Recently an important progress has been made by Hishida , where the asymptotic behavior of the two-dimensional stationary Stokes flow around a rotating obstacle is investigated in details. The equations studied in are written as Here is a given smooth function on . It is proved in that if and the smooth external force satisfies the decay conditions then the solution to decaying at spatial infinity obeys the asymptotic expansion where The result of leads to an important conclusion that the rotation of the obstacle resolves the Stokes paradox (see Chang and Finn for the rigorous description of the Stokes paradox) as in the Oseen resolution. We recall that when the obstacle is translating with a constant velocity the Navier-Stokes flows have been constructed by Finn and Smith for small but nonzero through the analysis of the Oseen linearization; see also Galdi . The resolution of the Stokes paradox for is due to the fact that the rotation removes the logarithmic singularity of the associated fundamental solution, which has been well known for the Oseen problem.  As a reference to the D exterior problem related with ours, the reader is referred to a recent work by Hillairet and Wittwer , where the stationary problem of is discussed when and the boundary condition is given as with a smooth and time-independent . We note that the stationary flow exactly solves this problem when . When is large enough and is sufficiently small the stationary solutions are constructed in around the explicit solution , where a number close to . Although the problem discussed in is in fact different from ours due to the time-independent given data in the original frame , the solutions obtained in share a common property with the ones in Theorem   in view of their asymptotic behaviors at spatial infinity.  It is well known that the existence of stationary Navier-Stokes flows in two-dimensional exterior domains (hence, formally in ) is an open problem in general. Partial results related to this problem have been obtained by Galdi , Russo , Yamazaki , and Pileckas and Russo , where the solutions are constructed under some symmetry conditions on both domains and given data. In particular, the Navier-Stokes flows decaying in the scale-critical order are obtained in in this category. The uniqueness is also available again under some symmetry conditions, see Nakatsuka .  The stability of the stationary solutions obtained in or in Theorem   is a highly challenging issue due to their spatial decay in the scale-critical order in two-dimensions, and it is still an open question in general. The difficulty is brought from the fact that the Hardy inequality , , does not hold when is an exterior domain in . As far as the authors know, the only result available so far is by the second author of this paper, where the local stability is established for the special solution , , when is the exterior domain to the unit disk.  Finally, let us state the key idea for the proof of Theorem  . Our approach is motivated by the linear analysis developed in , where is obtained through the detailed analysis of the fundamental solution associated to the system in . The expansion strongly indicates that the similar asymptotics is valid also for the Navier-Stokes flow, since the leading profile in is a stationary self-similar solution to the Navier-Stokes equations in . Thus our strategy for the proof of Theorem   can be summarized as follows: we derive at the same time the unique existence of solutions and their asymptotic behavior under the smallness condition on the given data in . The solution of the form of is constructed through the Banach fixed point theorem, where both the coefficient and the remainder term are sufficiently small corresponding to the size of . However, it is far from trivial to justify this idea directly from the results of , especially to ensure the smallness of in the iteration scheme. Indeed, there are at least two difficulties for this procedure: (I) the condition is slightly restrictive to handle the nonlinear term in the scale-critical framework, and more seriously, (II) the singularity on in for can prevent us closing the nonlinear estimates. In fact, the smooth flows subject to the system are pointwise bounded above by near the boundary due to the boundary condition .  For resolving the difficulty (I), the structure of the nonlinear term is essential. Indeed, the symmetry of the tensor leads to a crucial cancellation for the coefficient “”, which removes a possible singularity caused by the scale-critical decay of the flow. To overcome the difficulty (II), we revisit the argument of analyzing the fundamental solution to in and modify the singularity of in the estimates of the remainder term for the linear problem; see Theorem  , Lemma  , and Theorem  . Applying these improved estimates, the nonlinear problem is solved by the Banach fixed point theorem. However, the argument becomes complicated since we have to control two kinds of norms; the one bounds the local quantity, while the other one controls the spatial decay. This machinery is needed since the flow in a far field region () exhibits a different dependence on from the flow in a finite fluid region, and in principle, the problem becomes more singular at as is decreasing. In order to close the nonlinear estimates it is important to distinguish these two dependences on and to estimate their interaction through the nonlinearity carefully.  This paper is organized as follows. In Section   the basic results on the oscillatory integrals are collected, which are used to establish the pointwise estimates of the fundamental solution to with a milder singularity on , . In Section   the linearized problem with is studied in details. Section   is devoted to the analysis in , while the exterior problem is discussed in Section  . Finally the nonlinear problem is solved in Section  .">

Set Then, belongs to under the assumptions of (i) or (ii) in Theorem   by the Calder[ó]{}n-Zygmund inequality, and as is shown in , the pair satisfies in the sense of distributions. In virtue of the uniqueness result stated in , if satisfies one of the assumptions in Theorem  , and if is a solution to in the sense of distributions, then has a representation as and with some polynomials and . Hence, by the definition stated above, any weak solution to is represented as and is given by , as long as the condition (i) or (ii) on in Theorem   is assumed.  We note that in (ii) of Theorem   the coefficient is always well-defined when . The asymptotic expansion for the case (i) is firstly established by . Indeed, for the case (i) it is shown in that decays at infinity as , while the singularity appears in the coefficient of the estimates there. The novelty of Theorem   are and , where both the consistency in the weighted spaces and the milder singularity on for small are essential to solve the nonlinear problem in Section  . On the other hand, as in , the key step to prove Theorem   is the expansion and the pointwise estimate of the fundamental solution , which are stated in Lemma   below. The fundamental solution is studied in details in and we will revisit the argument developed by in the proof of this lemma.    Set  Then for the kernel satisfies  Here is the Kronecker delta and is independent of , , and .  The case of is obtained in but with dependence of the coefficients in the estimate. The case is not stated explicitly in , although it can be handled in the similar spirit as in the case . In this sense Lemma   is not completely new, and is an improvement of with respect to the singularity on for .  [Lemma  ]{} In principle, our proof of Lemma   will proceed along the line of . In fact, the only key difference of out proof for the case is the application of Lemmas  ,   in suitable parts. In the proof for the case , the inequality will be essentially used in addition.  Following the argument of , we decompose and define , , and as We also decompose and define , , , and as Then, by Lemma   the following representations hold: where we have used the equality To prove we observe that Let us estimate each term in the right-hand side of the above inequality. The key idea is to use the Taylor formula for around as follows. where and . To estimate we use the identity Let . Then we have from and , Here we have used for the second term and used the condition for the third term to achieve the last line. Clearly the last term in the right-hand side of is bounded from above by for , while in virtue of the first term is estimated as Thus we have arrived at Next we consider the derivative estimate for . Let us go back to the definition of in . Then is computed as By applying the first term is bounded from above by . To estimate the second term we observe that Then, by using the second term in the right-hand side of is bounded from above by . Hence we have shown that Exactly in the same way we obtain for and , Next we estimate the term . By the Taylor expansion stated in , we decompose and define , , and as For the last term it is straightforward to see from that, for , To estimate the first two terms we observe where Then, by using and by applying the term is estimated as Next we see where each component of the matrices and is a fourth order polynomial of written as a suitable sum of the terms with and , while is estimated as for . Thus we have from and , Summing up , , and , we obtain To estimate the derivatives in of we recall the definition of in and use , which leads to the representation From the expression of in , we have for , Here we have used . Next we estimate the derivatives of , which are computed as To estimate we observe that and that Here we have used for the first term and for the second term to derive the last line. It remains to estimate in . Below we consider the case only, for the case is obtained in the same manner. The direct computation yields the following key identity: Here and are the matrices whose components are suitable sums of the third order polynomials of the form with , while is estimated as for . Hence, recalling the expression of in , we have Here, we have again applied for the first term and for the second term to derive the last line. Finally we have Collecting , , , and , we have shown that The estimate of is obtained in the similar manner. Thus, from and we have obtained the estimates of the derivatives in for . The proof of Lemma   is complete.  [Theorem  ]{} The assertion that is a weak solution to (whose definitions are stated in the beginning of this subsection) follows from a similar argument as in . So we omit the details on this part and we focus on the proof for the estimates of here. (i) Let . Suppose that for some . Note that holds. Let . Then we have from Lemma   with , which implies with Here is independent of , , , , and . Then we use the inequality for , which leads to .  \(ii) Let and write and . From the integration by parts we see for and , Note that by the definition of . Moreover, we have for by , and by , which implies for . For simplicity we use the next notations: Then we have The sum of the first three terms of the right-hand side of this equality is denoted by . To estimate we firstly observe from Lemma  , Next we have from the direct calculation which implies Then by the transformation of the variables we have Here is independent of and . Collecting , , and , we obtain and . The proof of Theorem   is complete.  Based on the results of Theorem   we study the exterior problem in the next subsection, where its asymptotic profile is represented as the solution to by a cut-off technique. However, the existence of solutions to decaying at spatial infinity has to be proved carefully. As in , for the exterior problem, a natural way to construct solutions decaying at spatial infinity is to consider first a regularized system and to take the limit; see the proof of Theorem   for details. In this procedure we need to consider the following system in the whole space: where is a small positive number. Let us introduce the integral kernel as In virtue of the positive , the integral in converges absolutely for . Furthermore, the velocity defined by satisfies in the sense of distributions with a suitable pressure . The next lemma will be used in the proof of Theorem  .    Let and . Suppose that is of the form with some . Then for any and , the velocity defined by satisfies Here the constant is independent of and , and depends only on and .  In the same way as in the proof of Lemma  , we define by where Then we have where the constant is independent of and . By the integration by parts we rewrite as Then, proceeding as in the proof of Lemma  , we obtain where is independent of , , , and . Then we have where the constant is independent of and . The second term in the right-hand side of is also estimated as in the proof of Lemma  , resulting the estimate For the last term in the right-hand side of it is straightforward from to see Collecting , , and , we obtain .

It is trivial that converges. Let be a cut-off function introduced at the beginning of this subsection. The convergence of easily follows from the integration by parts: The last term in the right-hand side of vanishes in virtue of the decay as . In fact, by extending to the whole space by zero we have where we have used the transformation of the variables . Then the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem implies the right-hand side of the above inequality goes to zero as . In particular, we have The proof is complete.

Recalling that , we see from Theorem   that satisfies Here depends only on . It is easy to see by applying and the Poincar inequality. Similarly, the function is estimated as In order to estimate the pressure term let us recall the condition , which yields from , where is the topological dual of .

Indeed, since solves the Stokes system with the source term , for any bounded subdomain , there exists with such that where the constant depends on , , , and ; see for the proof. From and the Poincar inequality with depending only on and , we obtain the bound of in which is independent of . Let us recall that is taken so that and is a radial cut-off function such that for and for . As in the proof of Lemma  , we introduce the Bogovskii operator in the closed annulus , and set Recall that satisfies Then satisfies where Note that due to . Let be the function defined in .

To achieve this asymptotics we need the additional decay of such as ; see Theorem   below.  [Theorem  ]{} In the following argument we will freely use the condition . We look for the solution to of the form We need to determine and . Inserting into , we see that is the solution to the system Here and we may assume that . Note that we have used the relations , and the radial scalar function is taken so that . Both of these follow from the direct calculation. The proof of the unique existence below relies on the standard Banach fixed point argument in a suitable class of functions.

For any , let be the unique solution in Theorem   to the linear system Our aim is to show the unique existence of such that for suitably chosen and sufficiently small and . We remark that the value need not to be small when is positive. Let us start from the estimates for .

The properties (i) and (ii) imply the existence of the fixed point of in even for the case . Indeed, note that the sequence defined by and for is a Cauchy sequence in and each belongs to , which is not difficult to see from (i) and (ii). Then the limit of in also belongs to since is a closed subset in by the definition.  To prove (i) let us estimate based on the representation . By the trace theorem we have Hence we have from , Next let us estimate . Firstly we observe from , , and that On the other hand, we have from and by the condition , for any , where is independent of , , and . Here we have used that is symmetric and that for by its definition. Note that holds, which will be used later. Combining with , , , , and , we obtain for , Now we observe that for sufficiently small and (depending only on so far) the function is bounded from above as Here we have used the fact that is monotone increasing on , which implies . By taking , , and into account, we assume that , , , and are small enough so that Here is the largest constant of appearing in , , and (larger than without loss of generality), and then, is independent of and .

Precisely, we need the smallness such as where Here the number depends only on and is independent of and , and we also note that does not contain the number in its definition. Under the above smallness condition we have from with and the choice of , as desired. In the above argument the number can be arbitrary.  Next we estimate the norm (in the case is positive). To bound the term in the right-hand side of with , we need the additional smallness for and depending on : Precisely, in the case is positive, and are required to have the smallness as where the number depends on , contrary to the case of in .

Then we set as Then we can conclude from with and that It should be emphasized here that the argument works even if itself is large. We have now shown that is a mapping from into with the choice of in , , and for respectively.  Next let us show that is a contraction mapping on . For convenience we set , and for , . We also set which is equal to , and hence, the velocity satisfies where . Here is given by Below we give the estimates of , where the estimate for the norm of the term has to be carefully computed: in principle, we need to estimate it by rather than , for their dependence on is essentially different. Due to the negative power on in the linear estimate this is crucial to show that is a contraction mapping. Because of this reasoning we apply in Lemma A.1 by recalling the bound , which yields Here we have used the smallness of . Similarly, also for the nonlinear term in we will apply . Then it follows that and on the other hand, it is not difficult to see Similarly, we observe that By applying Theorem  , we have the representation of the velocity as Here we have used again, which follows from the symmetry of and from the fact that the trace of on is zero. Since and , we see from the definitions of and in , and thus, we also have from and , In virtue of - we see A similar argument as in the derivation of yields Moreover, by applying we see that the term satisfies Here we have used again the symmetry of . Combining , , and with , , and , we obtain for sufficiently small and in , that is, the map is a contraction on . Here we have used the estimates and if and the data related to appearing are small enough. Therefore, there exists a fixed point of in , which is unique in . By the definition of in , we see that the fixed point satisfies which is the solution to , as desired. Let us set for the fixed point . The local regularity of as well as follows from the standard elliptic regularity of the Stokes operator by regarding the nonlinear term, which belongs to by the above construction, as a given external force. This leads to the regularity and for the solution to by . Next we observe that solves Here we have used the identity by the definition of . Let us take the approximation of of the form where is the radial cut-off function satisfying for , for , and , while is the Bogovskii operator in the closed annulus which satisfies and Here is independent of ; see, e.g. Borchers and Sohr . Then, by multiplying both sides of the first equation in and integrating over , we obtain from the integration by parts. Here we have used again the identity for the radial circular flow: . It is easy to see from and that as . As for the term we see It remains to consider the term . From the integration by parts and from , , and we have Here we have also used . Collecting these above, we have arrived at the identity In particular, from the Poincar inequality we obtain the estimate which shows for the case by the relation . Note that the constant in depends only on and is independent of and . To obtain the energy inequality for the case we first consider the approximation of and such that Then for and Here we have used the condition for the convergence of . Assume that and we fix . Then there is a unique fixed point of in . On the other hand, since is fixed, there is such that Here we have used the fact that and is continuous on . Hence, in view of and , there is such that Let with , , be the unique solution to with replaced by such that with some . Note that for sufficiently large , we can take the same and . Then implies Since we have uniform estimates of , and thus, we find a subsequence, denoted again by , such that , and strongly in . Moreover, we observe from that satisfies the energy inequality It is also easy to see that is a solution to and . By the uniqueness of the fixed point of in , we have . Therefore, holds with replaced by , as desired. Thus we have also when and .  The estimates and follow from the fact and together with the definitions of in , , and when . As for the identity on the coefficient , we observe from , Since and near , where is a radial function and has been taken so that , the straightforward calculations yield Thus holds. The proof of Theorem   is complete.  Finally we consider the case . Combining Theorem   with Theorem   below, we obtain Theorem  .    Assume that satisfies the conditions in Theorem   for . Assume in addition that . Then the remainder in Theorem   belongs to .  The proof is very similar to the derivation of the energy inequality for the case in the proof of Theorem  . We set and as in . Then and satisfy , and moreover, the additional condition implies The proof of is as follows: for any small number , there exists such that by the decay condition . Then we have which implies . As in the proof of Theorem  , let , , , be the solution to with replaced by such that with some . Since and , it suffices to show that converges to in , where is the solution to . To prove this we observe that the difference solves Here we have set , , and Then the same argument as in the derivation of shows where is independent of . Thus, converges to in , which shows . The proof is complete.  We will prove the Hardy type inequality in two-dimensional exterior domains, which is used in the proof of Theorem  .  [**Lemma A.1**]{}[ LET BE AN EXTERIOR DOMAIN IN . THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT FOR ANY . HERE DEPENDS ONLY ON . IN PARTICULAR, IF THEN ]{}  Take and so that . By considering the zero extension of to , it suffices to show for and such that in . Fix . By the condition and the mean value theorem in the integral form we have which gives On the other hand, we have If then we obtain from and with . If then we take , which yields again from and that  Here we have used and , and is a numerical constant. Thus holds. The proof is complete.
