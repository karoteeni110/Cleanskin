    <title>A Massive Shell of Supernova-formed dust in SNR G54.1+0.3</title>
    <abstract>While theoretical dust condensation models predict that most refractory
elements produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) efficiently condense
into dust, a large quantity of dust has so far only been observed in
SN 1987A. We present the analysis of [SPITZER ]{}SPACE TELESCOPE,
[HERSCHEL ]{}SPACE OBSERVATORY, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA), and AKARI observations of the infrared (IR) shell
surrounding the pulsar wind nebula in the supernova remnant G54.1+0.3.
We attribute a distinctive spectral feature at 21  to a magnesium
silicate grain species that has been invoked in modeling the
ejecta-condensed dust in Cas A, which exhibits the same spectral
signature. If this species is responsible for producing the observed
spectral feature and accounts for a significant fraction of the observed
IR continuum, we find that it would be the dominant constituent of the
dust in G54.1+0.3, with possible secondary contributions from other
compositions, such as carbon, silicate, or alumina grains. The smallest
mass of SN-formed dust required by our models is 1.1  0.8 . We discuss
how these results may be affected by varying dust grain properties and
self-consistent grain heating models. The spatial distribution of the
dust mass and temperature in G54.1+0.3 confirms the scenario in which
the SN-formed dust has not yet been processed by the SN reverse shock
and is being heated by stars belonging to a cluster in which the SN
progenitor exploded. The dust mass and composition suggest a progenitor
mass of 16–27  and imply a high dust condensation efficiency, similar to
that found for Cas A and SN 1987A. The study provides another example of
significant dust formation in a Type IIP SN and sheds light on the
properties of pristine SN-condensed dust. </abstract>

<outline text="INTRODUCTION" _note="Interstellar dust plays a significant role in virtually all processes governing the evolution of galaxies and is a key ingredient in chemical evolution models and feedback processes important for star formation. Dust can be produced in the stellar wind outflows of massive stars and in the ejecta of core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions. However, the quantity and relative fraction of dust formed in these sources are still not well understood. The question of whether SN explosions are primary sources of dust in the Universe is still under debate. High dust masses observed in high-redshift galaxies suggest that large quantities of dust had to form on timescales of only a few hundred million years , pointing to core-collapse SNe as the most likely sources. Dwek, Galliano &amp; Jones (2009) find that an average SN explosion would need to produce anywhere from 0.1 to 1.0 of dust in order to explain the observed dust mass of in the galaxy SDSS J1148+5251 at a redshift of 6.4. The range of required masses is strongly dependent on the efficiency of dust destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy.  Theoretical dust formation models using classical nucleation theory and the chemical kinematic approach for the formation of molecular precursors do indeed predict that 0.03-0.7 of dust can form in the ejecta of core-collapse SNe, and that the grain properties and masses depend on factors such as the type of SN explosion, the mass of the SN progenitor, metallicity, and clumping and mixing of the SN ejecta . However, observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) and extragalactic SNe in the mid-infrared (IR) have generally revealed dust masses that are orders of magnitude lower, in the range of (see Gall et al. 2011 for a review). While it was hypothesized that a large mass of SN dust may be cooler and emitting primarily at far-IR wavelengths, the lack of sensitivity and spatial resolution, in addition to high confusion noise, prohibited clear detections of SN-formed dust in many SNe and SNRs.  Far-IR [HERSCHEL ]{}observations provided evidence for a significant amount of dust in only three SNRs; the Crab Nebula, Cas A, and SN 1987A. The dust mass in the Crab Nebula is estimated to be between 0.02-0.3 , while the current mass in Cas A is   , with 0.8-1.0 predicted to have formed initially, before being sputtered away by the SN reverse shock .  [HERSCHEL ]{}observations of SN 1987A led to an exciting discovery of a significant mass of dust that likely formed in the SN ejecta . The ejecta origin was later confirmed with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations . The latest estimate indicates that at least 0.5 of dust formed in the explosion. However, the composition of the dust is still a matter of debate , and how much will eventually survive the passage of the SN reverse shock is still unknown.  In this paper, we present a follow-up study of the dusty shell in the SNR G54.1+0.3, indicating that this system contains a significant mass of SN-formed dust. G54.1+0.3 contains a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with a well-defined jet and torus structure, exhibiting properties similar to the Crab Nebula . The age of the system is estimated to be 1500–3000 yrs . Based on the spectral types of stars in the surrounding stellar cluster, constrain the range of the progenitor mass to be 18–35 that likely resulted in a Type IIP SN explosion. This range overlaps with the results of who derived a progenitor mass of 15–20 using a model for the dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN inside an SNR.  The [SPITZER ]{}mid-IR images of this system revealed a shell of emission surrounding the PWN and a dozen point sources embedded in the shell with an apparent 24  IR excess. Due to this excess, the point sources were originally attributed to young stellar objects (YSOs) whose formation was triggered by the progenitor star . However, the analysis of line emission detected with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) aboard [SPITZER ]{} revealed that the shell has a high expansion velocity of up to 500 and that the emission likely originates from SN ejecta. The IR excess in the point sources can be attributed to SN-formed dust that is heated to higher temperatures as it blows past early-type stars that are members of the cluster in which the SN exploded . used near-IR spectroscopic observations of the stellar sources to determine their spectral types and concluded that they are indeed late O- or early B-type stars that show no evidence for emission lines often present in Herbig Ae/Be stars. also also constrained the distance to G54.1+0.3 by calculating the photometric distances to the stars in the shell based on their spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitted temperatures. Their derived distance range is 4.6–8.1 kpc, with an average of 6.0  0.4 kpc.  In this paper, we analyze the mid- and far-IR emission from the shell surrounding the PWN in G54.1+0.3 using the [SPITZER ]{}SPACE TELESCOPE, [HERSCHEL ]{}SPACE OBSERVATORY, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and AKARI observations in order to confirm the origin and determine the properties of the dust in the IR shell.">

The PACS observations were performed on 2011 Nov 5 using the “scan map” mode and a scan speed of 20 arcsec (proposal ID: OT1\_TTEMIM\_1, observations IDs: 1342231919-1342231922).

  <outline text="SOFIA Imaging" _note="G54.1+0.3 was observed by SOFIA on 2016 Feb 18 (OC4-A Flight 8), using the Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST). Simultaneous imaging in the short and long wavelength channels, using a cold dichroic beamsplitter, was done in F197 (+F315) and F253 (+F348) broadband filters with effective wavelengths of 19.7 (31.5), and 25.3 (34.8) m and bandwidths of 5.5 (1.86), 5.7 (3.8) m, respectively. G54.1+0.3 is an extended (5 in size) IR source that fits nicely into the FORCAST field-of-view. Chopping and nodding were done symmetrically about the telescope’s optical axis, using symmetric nod-match-chop (NMC) with a chop throw (the nod throw is matched to the chop throw in this chopping and nodding mode). This fairly large chop throw degrades the image quality by asymmetric smearing of the PSF at a level of per of chop amplitude. The resulting image degradation at the long wavelengths (31.5 m and 34.8 m) is quite modest, but at short wavelengths it becomes noticeable for unresolved point sources. No image dithering was employed. After postprocessing, the image pixel is . Data reduction was done at the SOFIA Science Center . We use the processed, flux calibrated (Level 3) images obtained from the raw (Level 1) observations of G54.1+0.3 using the standard FORCAST processing pipeline. The total exposure times are 1625, 1750, 1875, and 1670 s in F197, F253, F315, and F348 filters, respectively. The calibration uncertainty for each band is assumed to be  20% . The measured flux of the 25.3  image in particular is significantly lower than the measured MIPS 24  flux. We suspect that this observation was not sensitive to the fainter extended emission due to the poor throughput of the FORCAST 25.3  filter. The lack of faint extended emission is also evident in the FORCAST 25.3  image shown in Figure  . Due to the unreliable flux estimate for the extended emission, we exclude the 25.3  SOFIA data point from our analysis and fitting of the IR SED.">

<outline text="General Morphology" _note="The individual IR images of G54.1+0.3 from 15–500  are shown in Figure  , while the morphological comparison of X-ray, radio, and IR wavelengths is shown in the color images of Figure  . The left panel of Figure   shows the three-color image, with the [CHANDRA ]{}X-ray emission in blue, and [SPITZER ]{}8 and 24  emission in green and red. The X-ray image clearly shows the location of the pulsar (white point source), surrounded by a PWN with a well defined torus structure . There is a jet extending from the pulsar directly towards the west. The 8  emission in green primarily shows emission from stellar sources. The 24  image shows that the PWN is surrounded by a shell of IR emission, approximately 13 in radius. The dozen point sources that appear yellow in the image also have strong 24  fluxes. This is more clearly seen in the individual 24  image in Figure  . The sources appear to be embedded in the diffuse IR emission and arranged in a ring-like structure.  The middle panel of Figure   shows the PWN’s 4.8 GHz radio emission from the Very Large Array (VLA) in red , and [HERSCHEL ]{}PACS 100  emission in cyan. The location of the pulsar is marked by the white plus symbol. The PWN has a similar spatial extent at radio and X-ray wavelengths. The radio nebula fills the cavity of the shell that is traced by the 100  emission and appears to have expanded into this material. The complementary morphology of the radio and IR emission confirms the association and possible interaction between the PWN and the IR shell.  The 15 and 24  images show point-like emission that coincides with the stellar sources observed at 8  (see Figure  ). In the higher resolution SOFIA images, these sources appear to be somewhat more extended. While the 31.5–100  images do show some structure and regions of enhanced emission, there is no clear evidence for point-like emission. At 160  and above, the shell emission appears more uniform, partly due to the lower resolution at these wavelengths. While a full shell is still apparent in the 160 and 250  images, the emission at 350 and 500  primarily arises from a more localized region in the western part of the shell. This may suggest that there is either a higher fraction of colder dust present in this region of the shell, leading to a higher flux density at 500 , or that there is more mass, and therefore higher emission, concentrated in the western region. The shell morphology in the mid- and far-IR appears to be different. The emission at 70 and even at 100  appears more circular, while the shell structure at 250  appears more elongated in the north/south direction. This is most apparent in the two-color image shown in the third panel Figure  , in which the 70  image shown in teal has been convolved to the resolution of the 250  image shown in red. The 160  emission in Figure   seems to be a blend of these two morphologies. In later sections, we will show that the emission in the far-IR either arises from distinct dust component than the one producing the mid-IR emission, or that it is associated with background emission.">

<outline text="Origin of the IR Shell" _note="The study of the [SPITZER ]{}IR imaging and spectroscopy of the shell in G54.1+0.3 concluded that the emission most likely arises from newly formed dust in the SN ejecta . In this scenario, the IR emitting material is the inner SN ejecta that the PWN is expanding into and that has not yet been reached by the SNR reverse shock. In addition to the complementary morphologies of the PWN and the shell that suggest that they are interacting, modeling of the observed IR line intensities from the shell implies that the PWN is driving a 25-30 shock into the ejecta. In one particular location (coinciding with Region 2 in Figure  ), the measured gas density is as high as 500–1300 . This region coincides with a brightness peak in the MIPS 24  image and may represent ejecta material that has been compressed by the shock driven by the pulsar’s jet . Another piece of evidence that suggests that the shell material is composed of SN ejecta is the composition of the dust itself (see Section  ).   argued that the IR excess in the point sources in the [SPITZER ]{}24  image (see Figures   and  ) is not stellar in origin, but that the emission instead arises from ejecta dust that is being radiatively heated by early-type stars belonging to a stellar cluster in which the SN exploded. The stars heat the dust in their immediate vicinity to higher temperatures, giving rise to a mid-IR excess that appears point-like due to the limited spatial resolution. This scenario is consistent with the morphology of the images in Figure  , in which we see that the regions with enhanced brightness in the long wavelength SOFIA and the MIPS 70  images and longward do not appear point-like, but are instead more extended. classified the spectral type of each star in the shell and concluded that they are indeed late O- and early B-type stars with no evidence for any emission lines that are typically associated with Herbig Ae/Be stars. This provides further evidence that the 24  point-like emission is not intrinsic to the stars.  The evidence outlined above strongly suggests that the IR shell is not circumstellar in origin and that the mid-IR point sources are not YSOs. An additional argument against a circumstellar origin is the lack of any X-ray thermal emission that would results from the interaction of the SN blast wave with the surrounding dense material. Additionally, a reverse shock would have formed as the SN blast wave encountered the cloud and significantly disrupted the PWN. However, the well-defined torus and jet structures and the modeling of the PWN evolution strongly suggest that this has not occurred and that the material that we observe in the shell arises from inner SN ejecta.  The G54.1+0.3 system is analogous to the Crab Nebula, which also consists of a PWN expanding into and radiatively heating SN ejecta and dust . However, in the case of G54.1+0.3, the stars that are part of the cluster in which the progenitor was born serve as the primary heating sources for the SN-condensed dust as it blows past them. We note that additional ejecta material may be present beyond the radius of the observed IR shell, but remain undetected due to its cold temperature.">

<outline text="ANALYSIS OF THE DUST EMISSION">
  <outline text="Extraction of Source Fluxes" _note="The source fluxes for the entire IR shell in G54.1+0.3 were measured from the AKARI, SOFIA, [SPITZER ]{}MIPS 24 , and [HERSCHEL ]{}PACS and SPIRE images that are shown in Figure  . The SOFIA FORCAST fluxes were extracted from the images using a circular aperture with a radius of 10, centered on the IR shell. Since the observations were performed using the chop/nod technique, the background was already removed from the images. The AKARI, [SPITZER ]{}and [HERSCHEL ]{}fluxes were extracted using an aperture around the IR shell, approximately a circle with a 15 radius, and a 41 45 rectangular region for the background, centered on the shell and excluding the source extraction region. We used the average value in the rectangular region as the background flux and the standard deviation of the pixel-to-pixel fluxes within the region as the background uncertainty. Significant spatial variations in the brightness of the background are evident in the 160-500  images shown in Figure  . In calculating the average background in the SPIRE 250-500  images, we masked the brightest cores of the surrounding clouds. The overall uncertainties in the measured flux densities longward of 100  are dominated by background confusion. The foreground/background stellar sources that appear in the 15  AKARI image, but not at 24 , were excluded from the flux measurement.  The IR flux densities for the G54.1+0.3 shell are listed in Table  . We applied an extinction correction to the 15.0–34.8  flux densities using the mid-IR interstellar extinction law derived by from the SDSS- III/APOGEE spectroscopic survey. For the bands that were not explicitly calculated in , we used the average of the and the =5.5 extinction curves . These two curves diverge only for our 15 and 19  data points. In deriving the corrections, we assume =7.3 , leading to =0.82. The final extinction correction factors that were used in the SED fitting are listed in Table  .">

  <outline text="Fitting of the IRS Spectra" _note="In Figure  , we show the line-subtracted continuum emission at the two IRS positions shown in Figure  . The prominent emission feature at 21  has been attributed to dust grains and used by to fit the dust continuum in Cas A. The mass absorption coefficient that clearly shows this feature is plotted as the purple curve in Figure  . The spectra in Figure   show that the feature is much more prominent in position 2 than position 1. We find that the IRS spectra are well fitted by a hotter dust component of either carbon or silicate grains, plus a dust composition emitting at cooler temperature. The hot component has a best-fit temperature of 147 2 K (152 1 K) for carbon grains and 146 1 (133 1) for silicate grains at positions 1 (2). The best-fit temperatures of the dust are 47 1 and 58 1 at positions 1 and 2, respectively, independent of whether the carbon or silicate grains are used to model the hot dust component. The fits indicate that the hot dust component dominates the spectra shortward of 17 , while the warm component dominates at longer wavelengths. The difference in the shapes of the mid-IR continua at the two positions appear to be caused by variations in the dust temperature of the warm component and not by variations in the grain composition, with the less prominent 21  feature at position 1 being an effect of a colder dust temperature that peaks at longer wavelengths.">

  <outline text="Global SED Fits" _note="The global SED of the IR shell is shown in Figures   and  , with individual flux density values listed in Table  . show that the 21  spectral feature is present in all regions covered by the [SPITZER ]{}low-resolution IRS slits, and since the slits span the entire length of the IR shell in the east/west direction, this suggests that the feature is likely present throughout the shell. We also verified that the hot dust component arising from the fits to the IRS high-resolution spectra in Figure   is also present in all regions covered by the low-resolution slits. We therefore included the hot dust component from either carbon grains (Figure  ) or silicate grains (Figure  ), as well as a contribution from grains in all of our SED fits. While an additional third component was not statistically significant in the fit, we explored the possibility of its presence using various grain composition.  As part of our fitting method, we convolved the model spectra with the spectral response of each instrument to derive the expected flux density in each bandpass, applied extinction to each of the values by dividing by the extinction factors in Table  , and then fitted the resulting values to the observed flux densities. Figures   and   show the observed flux densities and their uncertainties in red, the best-fit model spectra as the black curves, and the bandpass-integrated and reddened model flux densities in black, with the filter widths indicated by the horizontal black lines.  We first fitted the global SED with two dust components; a hot dust component of either carbon or silicate grains, and a cooler component of grains. We fixed the hot component’s temperatures to those found in the spectral fits in Figure  , 150 K for carbon and 140 K for silicates, while letting their normalizations vary. The resulting best-fit normalization leads to a dust mass of (4.6 1.2) and (2.2 0.5) for carbon and silicate grains, respectively. The resulting relative normalizations of the hot and warm components are consistent with those found for the spectral fits.  We then performed fits to the global SED using an additional (third) cold component composed of various grain compositions. In addition to trying an additional cold component of grains (Figure  b), we also tested amorphous carbon , silicates , , and grains. The mass absorption coefficients for these grain species are shown in Figure  , while the best fits to the SED are shown in Figure  c– f with carbon as the hot component, and Figure  c– f with silicates as the hot component. The best-fit dust temperatures and masses for all models in Figures   and   are listed in Table   and will be discussed in detail in Sections   and  .  The hot carbon/silicate plus a single warm model gives a best-fit temperature of 47 K and a mass of 1.8 0.3 , assuming a distance of 6.0 kpc. The implausibly large dust mass suggests that the grains are not the sole contributors to the mid-IR SED and that other grain compositions are likely also present. The addition of another composition resulted in a lower for all models, with carbon grains providing a somewhat higher than the others due to its flatter slope in emissivity at longer wavelengths (see Figure  ). The best-fit temperature of the primary dust component is 47–49 K for all model combinations. The temperature and mass of the secondary dust composition are not well constrained and this produces very large uncertainties in the relative masses of the different grain compositions as well as in the total dust mass in the shell.  The relative flux densities of the best fit models plotted in Figures   and   appear to be consistent with the observed morphologies in Figure  . For instance, as mentioned in Section  , the morphology at 100  and below is different than the observed structure at 250 . The best fits to the global SED show that the emission up to 100  is dominated by the warm dust component, while the colder dust component that may have a different spatial morphology dominates at 250  and above. In the 160  band, the warm and cold component have comparable contributions. In later sections, we will explore the possibility that the emission at 250  and above actually arises from a background cloud.">

  <outline text="Spatially Resolved Fits: Dust Mass &amp;amp; Temperature Maps" _note="In order to explore the spatial variations in the dust temperature and mass of the shell, we fitted the SEDs of individual pixels across the shell using a single dust component of grains. In order to preserve the spatial resolution, minimize the effects of the background confusion, and also to only model wavelengths that appear to have similar morphologies, we only used the 15–100  images in our fits. The SOFIA images were also excluded due to the poor sensitivity to the fainter emission in the shell. The images were all convolved to the PACS 160  resolution using the convolution kernels, resulting in a pixel size of 32. The SED fits provided a temperature and corresponding dust mass for each pixel. These maps are shown in Figure  , with the left panel showing the temperature map and the right panel showing the dust mass surface density map. The black contours represent the [CHANDRA ]{}X-ray emission from the PWN seen in Figure  , while the “x&quot; symbols represent the locations of the stars identified by and .  The temperature in the shell varies from 42 – 57 K with an average temperature and standard deviation of 46 4 K. The sum of the individual pixels in the dust mass surface density map leads to a total dust mass of , consistent with the mass derived from fitting the integrated SED of the shell using only grains (see Table  ). The dust mass and temperature maps are consistent with the physical scenario proposed by in which the stellar sources heat the surrounding SN-condensed dust, since the temperature clearly peaks at the locations of the stellar sources, while the dust mass surface density shows no such correlation. The dust mass surface density map does show a slight deficiency in dust mass at the locations of the brightest stellar sources. The most likely explanation for this deficiency is that the temperature at the locations of the stars was slightly overestimated due to the inclusion of 15  data that has a significant contribution from hot dust.  In order to determine how well the single-component spatial fits match the global SED, we compared the observed and model-predicted flux densities of the shell at all observed wavebands. While the 19-70  data are well represented by the model, the 15  flux is underestimated by 35%. The model also underestimates the observed emission at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 , by 28%, 44%, 43%, 23%, and 16%, respectively. In order to investigate the nature of the excess emission above the best-fit spatial model, we used the dust mass and temperature maps in Figure   to produce model-predicted flux density images at 15, 24, 70, 100, and 160 , and then divided the observed images by these maps to produce ratio maps. The ratio maps are shown in Figure  , all using the same linear scale (0.8–3.3) and color scheme. The blue color indicates a ratio of 1, where the model most closely matches the observation, while the values above unity show the spatial distribution of the emission excess that was not well-predicted by the model. The 24 and 70  emission is clearly well-described by the model across the entire shell, while there is a clear excess at 15, 100, and 160 .  The spatial distribution of the excess at 15  is particularly interesting. It does not at all correlate with the shell morphology at 24 , but is instead concentrated along a thin shell on the outskirts of the observed mid-IR shell, as well as a couple of point sources, one of which is a background source not associated with the SNR. This suggests that the 15  excess emission does not belong to the same dust component that emits at 24 , but instead may be produced by hot dust grains that have a different spatial distribution or by line emission that could partly contribute to the 15  AKARI band. One hypothesis is that very small dust grains in the shell are heated to temperatures much higher than the equilibrium temperature due to their lower heat capacity, and that their emission is more pronounced at the outskirts of the cluster where the radiation field starts to drop off and where the temperature of the larger grains is cooler. The presence of this hot component is also supported by the fits to the IRS spectra shown in Figure  . We note here that the average contribution of the hot dust component in the IRS fits to the 15  AKARI waveband is 35%, the same fraction that is seen in the 15  excess above the best spatial fit (first panel of Figure  ).  The ratio maps at 100 and 160  show that the morphology of the excess emission resembles the morphology in the far-IR. This is seen more clearly in Figure  , where we show the observed 160  image in panel (a), the spatial model-predicted 160  flux arising from in panel (b), the residual between the observed image and the fitted model in panel (c), and the 250  observed image in panel (d). For comparison, we also show a map of the   157.7  line emission from the PACS spectral observations in Figure  e, which does not seem to correlate with the 160  dust emission, but instead shows a spatial distribution more similar to the morphology of the 15  excess in Figure  . The residual map in panel (c) of Figure   clearly shows that the excess emission at 160  closely resembles the morphology at 250 , suggesting that the 100 and 160  excess above the spatial model either arises from a distinct dust component that dominates the emission at longer wavelengths or from background emission not associated with the SNR.  In Section  , we explored the possibility that an additional dust component with a different composition contributes to the global SED of the shell and dominates the emission at wavelengths longer than 100 . The best-fit parameters for the models that include this secondary component are listed in Table  . Another possibility is that the emission at long wavelengths actually originates from a background cloud, since the morphology at wavelengths longer than 160   differs from the morphology at shorter wavelengths. If we assume that the emission at 24-70  is dominated by a single dust component of , as was assumed in the spatial fit, we can then test whether the level of residual emission at longer wavelengths is consistent with the surrounding background. In Figure  , we show a scatter plot of the 100 versus 160  flux densities for the observed emission in the shell, the best-fit spatial model for a single component of grains, the residual emission after the subtraction of the spatial model, and finally, the background emission in an annulus surrounding the source. The gray lines represent the 160/100  ratios for various temperature of grains. As can be seen from the plot, the best-fit spatial model is composed of grains emitting in a narrow temperature range between 45 and 55 K (also seen in the left panel of Figure  ), while the long-wavelength residual is seen to have the same properties as surrounding background emission.  In this scenario, the grains with a temperature and mass distribution shown in Figure   dominate the emission from 15–100 , while residual background emission significantly contributes to the 160  flux and dominates at the far-IR SPIRE wavelengths. We therefore performed additional fits to the global SED, assuming that the residual long-wavelength emission arises from the background. We used the same compositions as in Section  , but subtracted the residual long-wevelength emission from the integrated flux densities. Since the fit, by definition, is well described by a single component of warm grains (in addition to the hot component derived from the spectral fits), a third component is not statistically significant. However, adding this component allowed us to test whether an addition of grains of a different composition affects the best-fit dust parameters. The results of the fits are included in Table  , in the subsections indicating that the long-wavelength residual emission has been excluded, and will be discussed in Sections   and  .">

  <outline text="Composition" _note="The prominent spectral feature that is observed at 21  has the same spectral profile as the feature observed in the spectrum of the SN-condensed dust in Cas A . As far as we know, Cas A and G54.1+0.3 are the only two sources whose spectra exhibit a feature of this particular shape. attributed the feature to grains, characterized by an MgO to SiO ratio of 0.7. Out of sixty different grain compositions that they tested, this species is the only one that has a 21  spectral feature that fits the width and shape of the feature observed in Cas A. As discussed in Section  , we confirmed that the same grain species can fit the [SPITZER ]{}high-resolution spectra of G54.1+0.3 that are shown in Figure  . Since the 21  feature is present throughout the low-resolution IRS slits that run across the IR shell , we used the grains as the primary component in all our fits, but also included other common grain compositions predicted by dust condensation models in Type IIP SNe for possible secondary components. For example, the models of and predict that 80–100% of the SN-condensed dust in Type IIP explosions of  20  progenitors is made up of carbon, alumina, and some form of magnesium silicate grains. The mass absorption coefficients of the grain species used in our fits are shown in Figure  , and they include amorphous carbon, silicates, , and . Another common dust composition predicted by is MgO, but our fits disqualify a major contribution from this species due its spectral feature at  100  that does not appear in the SED of the shell.  The best fits in Figure   and Table   indicate that if the grains are indeed responsible for producing the feature and account for a significant fraction of the observed emission at mid-IR wavelengths, they are a major component of the total dust mass in the shell. Any additional component is equally well fitted by the other grain species we tested (see Table  ), with the exception of carbon component, which results in a somewhat larger . This is due to the fact that the absorption coefficient for carbon grains (see Figure  ) produces a somewhat flatter slope at longer wavelengths than indicated by the SPIRE data.">

  <outline text="Temperature" _note="The map in Figure   shows the temperature distribution of the grains. Since the grains at any given location will likely have a distribution of grain sizes, the temperature for any given pixel should be thought of as the average temperature for that location. The temperature of the dust in the shell ranges from 42 to 57 K, with an average temperature and standard deviation of 46 4 K. The plot in Figure   shows the mass-temperature distribution in the shell, and indicates that most of the mass is actually emitting in a narrow temperature range of 43–52 K. This explains why the mass of the single-temperature warm component fit in Table   is similar to that found from the spatially resolved fit, unlike what would be expected for a very wide dust temperature distribution in the shell .  The left panel of Figure   clearly shows that the temperature peaks at the location of the stars that are embedded in the shell, confirming that the stars are the primary heating sources for the surrounding dust. In order to verify that this is plausible, we compared the total luminosity of the eleven O and B stars in the shell analyzed by to the total luminosity of the IR SED seen in Figure  . Based on the spectral classification of the stars, we assume a luminosity of 25,000  for each star. We calculate an IR luminosity of the shell to be  9500 , which is only a small fraction of the total luminosity of the stars, approximately 3.5%. We note that there may be additional stars present inside the volume of the shell for which near-IR spectroscopy was not obtained by these authors. In particular, the bright extended region in the left panel of Figure   that coincides with position 2 of the IRS slit and also shows up as a hot region in the dust temperature map in Figure   is likely heated by an early-type star identified by , but not studied by . The location of this star is marked by the green“x&quot; in Figure  . This region also has a higher gas density that is likely produced by the compression of the ejecta material by the pulsar’s jet , but while the jet may contribute to some heating of the dust in this location, the dust temperature distribution and total luminosity imply that the stars are responsible for most of the heating.  The results from the global SED fits in Table   show that all model combinations result in grains that are warmer on average than the secondary dust component of a different composition. While a physical dust heating model for the dust in the shell will be explored in a future publication, our preliminary model for heating of dust around a single B0V star confirms that the grains are heated to higher temperatures than carbon or silicate grains with comparable sizes. It furthermore shows that a typical grain size of the dust would need to be relatively large (on the order of  ) to achieve the temperatures produced by the best fits in Table  .">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Mass" _note="The dust mass surface density map in the right panel of Figure   shows that the dust in the G54.1+0.3 is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the shell, with one region of enhancement corresponding to Region 1 of Figure  . The dust mass associated with this enhancement is approximately  5% of the total dust mass in the shell. We note that this region does not coincide with the temperature peak at the western edge of the PWN where the gas density enhancement is found by , but instead seems to spatially coincide with the   peak seen in Figure 11 of . The emission from this region was suggested to arise from ejecta material swept-up by the PWN .  The best-fit total dust masses for various composition combinations are listed in Table  . We present the results that assume the long-wavelength emission originates from the shell, as well as the results that treat this emission as background emission. The models for which the mid-IR emission arises solely from grains produce unreasonably large best-fit dust masses that are inconsistent with nucleosynthetic yields for SN ejecta. This suggests that other grain species with higher emissivities at longer wavelengths are also present in the shell. When a secondary dust composition is included in the models, the best-fit dust masses are somewhat lower, but still higher than what might be expected for SN-condensed dust. For example, for models considering carbon, silicate, or alumina grains as secondary components, the best-fit dust masses range from 1.1-1.5 . However, since the temperature and mass of the secondary component are poorly constrained, the uncertainty on the total mass can be as high as  . The lower dust mass limit for the best fit models in Table   (the best-fit value minus the uncertainty) ranges from 0.26 to 1.0 , depending on the chosen composition of the secondary component. These lower limits are achieved when the flux density contribution of the secondary dust component to mid-IR wavelengths is at a maximum, which slightly raises the temperature and decreases the normalization of the primary dust component, effectively decreasing the total dust mass in the shell.  We emphasize that the inferred dust masses are highly dependent on the model that we use to fit the SED. While our choice of grain compositions was motivated by the observed spectral feature and most common dust species arising from dust condensation models, the relative contributions and temperatures of the various dust component will need to be verified by physical dust heating models that properly take into account the radiation field produced by the stellar cluster and a distribution of dust grain sizes and temperatures. For example, a model that included radiative heating of dust grains with a continuous size distribution in the Crab Nebula resulted in a total dust mass that is a factor of two lower than for a two-temperature model that fits the data equally well and uses the same dust grain composition . In future work, it will be important to determine whether the parameter space produced by a heating model will allow for a significantly lower total dust mass in G54.1+0.3. Additional limitations and sources of uncertainty are discussed in Section  .">

  <outline text="Caveats and Limitations" _note="The estimated dust masses in this work are highly dependent on the chosen model parameters and would vary with changes in the source distance and dust grain composition, shape, size distribution, porosity, and clumping. One of the main assumptions that drives the total dust mass is that the 21  feature and a significant fraction of the mid-IR continuum in the spectrum of the G54.1+0.3 shell arise from grains. Based on the available optical constants, this grain composition is the only one that reproduces the precise shape of the 21  feature . However, there may be other grain compositions with higher emissivities at wavelengths longward of this feature that reproduce it equally well, which would in turn lower the estimated dust mass.  As mentioned in Section  , introducing a wide distribution of grain sizes, and therefore temperatures, may also affect the relative contribution of the various dust species to the global SED and change the derived dust mass. The dust mass would also change if the grains are porous or not spherical. While we cannot rule out porous grains in our model, studies of meteoritic grains that likely originate from SNe show that they are compact . Since compact grains were also used to estimate the the dust mass in of SN 1987A, for example, our estimate for G54.1+0.3 at least provides a relative dust mass in relation to those estimated for other SNRs that contain SN-condensed dust.  Another matter of concern is the balance of heating and cooling of the dust in the shell. The IR observations show that only a small fraction of the stellar radiation is reradiated by the dust in the shell. While the available data on the UV absorption properties of grains in particular are incomplete, silicate grains in general are opaque at these wavelengths, so we would expect a much higher fraction of the stellar flux to be absorbed if the total dust mass exceeded a few tenths of solar masses. However, if the grains are indeed as large as 1  (see Section  ), their effective absorption per unit mass will be smaller, so the larger dust masses would likely not be in conflict with the inferred low value of the UV optical depth. A more detailed physical heating model will be necessary to resolve these ambiguities and determine whether including these additional effects will significantly alter the dust mass estimate for G54.1+0.3.">

<outline text="Discussion" _note="The fact that the dust in the G54.1+0.3 IR shell shows a fairly uniform spatial mass distribution and no evidence for enhancements at the locations of the stellar sources confirms that the point-like 24  excess (Figure  ) does not originate from dust intrinsic to the stars. The dust mass surface density map is consistent with the scenario in which the stars are heating a shell of dust that condensed from the SN ejecta. The lower mass limit of at least 0.26 of SN-formed dust derived from the SED fits would be the second largest observationally confirmed dust mass after SN 1987A , assuming that the grains are compact and that the grains are responsible for the observed 21  feature and a significant fraction of the mid-IR continuum (additional caveats are discussed in Section  ). A large dust mass of 0.8 requiring a high condensation efficiency was also inferred for Cas A, accounting for the fact that some of the dust has already been destroyed by the reverse shock . The comparison of the estimated dust mass in G54.1+0.3 with nucleosynthetic yields implies a similarly high condensation efficiency.  The PWN in G54.1+0.3 has not yet been overtaken by the SNR reverse shock, so it is not unexpected that the mass of the SN-formed dust is still high. Just how much of the observed dust will eventually survive the shock and be injected into the ISM remains uncertain. estimate that only 12–16% of dust grains will survive the passage of the reverse shock in Cas A. However, this percentage may be higher in the case of Type IIP progenitors that are expected to form larger grains that are not as easily destroyed. For example, in their models that account for the for the gas-phase chemistry, nucleation, and coagulation of grains, find that Type IIP SNe tend to form larger grains, especially if the ejecta are clumpy, and that ejecta clumpiness also leads to somewhat higher dust masses and a higher fraction of metallic grains. In addition, if the SN that produced G54.1+0.3 occurred in a low density bubble produced by the OB association, the reverse shock may be very weak once it encounters the SN-condensed dust that surrounds the PWN, leading to a higher survival rate of grains and a higher eventual dust mass input into the ISM. This hypothesis will need to be tested with more detailed modeling of the dust destruction by the SN reverse shock.  In order to compare our estimated dust masses with nucleosynthetic yields, we list the yields of C, O, Mg, Al, and Si for different progenitor masses in Table  , based on the models of and . The table also lists the maximum possible mass of , MgO + SiO, , and carbon dust that could form in the ejecta assuming a 100% condensation efficiency. The amount of is limited by the total number of the Mg or Si atoms, depending on whether is less or greater than 0.7. The mass of MgO+SiO2 assumes that all Mg and Si in the ejecta are locked up in MgO and SiO and/or one or more forms of grains. We compare these values to the lower dust mass limit in the G54.1+0.3 shell, listed in Table  . The lower mass limit of 0.25 of grains is consistent with nucleosynthetic constraints for a progenitor of at least  15 , but this requires a mass of  0.03 , which corresponds to a progenitor mass of at least 21 (see Table  ). However, slightly increasing the mass of would decrease the required mass of and therefore lower this limit on the progenitor mass. The next lowest dust mass lower limit of 0.28 is for the plus carbon dust model, and implies a progenitor mass of at least 16 .  The primary composition of the grains may also offer some clues about the SN progenitor. For example, the grains that make up a large fraction of the dust are characterized by a Mg to Si ratio of 0.7. The sixth column of Table   lists the ratio of the numbers of Mg to Si atoms in the ejecta () for different progenitor masses. This ratio is less than unity for progenitor masses of  27  and below. A ratio below unity may explain the formation of the less common magnesium silicate grain species, such as , instead of the more common ones like forsterite (MgSiO) for which Mg/Si = 2. The mass and the composition of the grains in G54.1+0.3 therefore suggest that the mass of the SN progenitor was in the 16–27  range, consistent with the estimate of and the range of 18–35  suggested by the analysis of the stellar cluster by . We note here that a dust condensation efficiency of 100% would lead to a more massive progenitor.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="We analyzed the 15–500  IR emission from a dusty shell of SN-formed dust surrounding the PWN in the SNR G54.1+0.3. We find that the SED, and in particular a spectral feature at 21 m, is well described by a dust composition of grains, with a secondary component possibly arising from carbon, silicate, or alumina grains. Through a spatially resolved analysis of the IR emission, we derive dust temperature and mass surface density maps that confirm the scenario in which stellar members of the SN progenitor’s cluster are the primary heating sources for the SN dust. The smallest total dust mass resulting from our models is 1.1  0.8 , assuming compact grains and a distance of 6 kpc. Self-consistent radiative heating models that invoke a continues distribution of grain sizes may affect this estimate and allow for a lower mass. Nevertheless, the large quantity of dust inferred from our model implies a high dust condensation efficiency, as has been suggested for both SN 1987A and Cas A . A comparison of the dust mass and composition with nucleosynthetic yields suggests that G54.1+0.3 resulted from a 16–27  progenitor. Since the dusty shell has not yet been encountered by the SN reverse shock, the ultimate survival of the dust remains unclear. This study implies that dust can efficiently form in the ejecta of Type IIP SN explosions, and that certain classes of SNe may indeed be significant sources of dust in the Universe. Future high spatial resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations, particularly with the JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, as well as detailed physical dust heating models will be necessary to confirm these results.
