<outline text="The correlation functions[sec:def]" _note="The relevant order parameter for the problem at hand is the overlap function which measures the distance between two configurations “&quot; and “&quot; of the same system. Denoting the position of the th particle as in configuration “&quot; and in configuration “&quot; we define where is the Heaviside step function and is a constant length which is taken below to be 1/3 in Lennard-Jones units (see below for numerical details). Thus for two identical configurations and when the distance between the positions of all the particles in the two configurations exceed . Based on the introductory discussion, we now derive an expression for the correlator associated with the longitudinal mode, from whence one can extract the correlation length associated with the onset of criticality at the yielding point, and define an associated susceptibility which will shoot up as the yielding point is approached. The first step is to “localize&quot; the overlap function and define the -dependent quantity Next, as mentioned above, the expression for the longitudinal correlator in terms of four-replica correlation functions can be found by diagonalization of the correlation matrix , which is defined as the inverse of the mass matrix of the replicated field theory of the overlap order parameter  . The derivation is a matter of standard diagonalization algebra, so we shall not report it here and refer to the SI for the details. The expression, employed for example in  in the case of a model with spins on a lattice, reads for athermal systems with the definitions Here angular brackets denote a thermal average in the thermal case and an evaluation in an inherent state in the athermal case; an indicates an average over different samples of the glass. The quantity is the correlation function of the replicon mode  and is just the garden-variety four-point correlator.  Using these definitions and taking Eq. into account, the quantities we compute in numerical simulation, before taking the ensemble average, are (see the SI and Ref. ): and with These four-replica objects can be computed for any quadruplet of distinct replicas. The ensemble averaged correlation functions are simply obtained as and , and cf. the SI for a proof. We stress that one must keep the full space dependence of the correlators in the definitions above, as the introduction of shear breaks the rotational symmetry of the glass samples and so the correlators are not just functions of a distance .">

<outline text="Numerics" _note="To measure the quantities defined above, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a Kob-Andersen 65-35% Lennard Jones Binary Mixture in . We have three system sizes, , and . We chose with in LJ units, but verified that changes in leave the emerging picture invariant.  Following the procedure reported in Ref. , as a first step we prepared a glass by equilibrating the system at , and then quenching it (the rate is ) down to into a glassy configuration. The sample is then heated up again to , and a starting configuration of particle positions is chosen at this temperature. Note that while at equilibration is sufficiently fast, at the computation time is much shorter than the relaxation time. The configuration is then assigned a set of velocities randomly drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at , and these different samples are then quenched down to at a rate of . This procedure can be repeated any number of times (say 100 times), and it allows us to get a sampling of the configurations, or replicas, inside one single “glassy patch&quot;. We then perform this procedure again, using each time a different configuration from the parent melt at , and in doing so we get an ensemble of these glassy patches, each of them representing a distinct glass sample. For each of these patches, we measure the four-replica correlators defined above for any distinct quadruplet of replicas, averaging the result over any possible permutations of the quadruplet to gain statistics . The ensemble average is then performed by averaging the result over all the glass samples. To perform these measurement, below we use 100 patches for , each with 100 configurations, 100 patches for each with 50 configurations and 50 patches for each with 50 configurations. A strain (denoted below as ) is then applied quasi-statically to all configurations in all patches. In this protocol after every step of increased strain the system undergoes energy gradient minimization to return to mechanical equilibrium. This creates an ensemble of STRAINED PATCHES for every value of the strain parameter , from whence we measure again the above defined correlators, which then become functions of the strain . This is simply a consequence of the response of the configurations, i.e. each position in the definitions above becomes . Thus for example becomes etc. We are interested in the behavior of the correlators as the yielding point is approached.  ">

<outline text="Results" _note="We consider first the susceptibilities and that can be obtained from the correlators, for example In figure   upper panel we show the susceptibility as a function of for the three system sizes at our disposal. Superimposed are the stress vs. strain curves obtained by averaging the individual curves over all the available configurations and glass samples. One sees very clearly the singularity that develops near the yield point as a function of the system size. In the lower panel of the same figure we show the susceptibility as a function of the strain , again with the stress-strain curve superimposed for comparison. As we expected, the susceptibilities show a distinct peak at the spinodal point wherein yielding occurs. Since is much smaller in amplitude than there is no much new information in which is approximately 2.  More detailed information is provided by the full dependence of the correlators on their arguments. To see most clearly the change in the correlators as the spinodal point is approached, it is best to consider for example the one-dimensional function , shown for in Fig.  .  Similar results for the other systems sizes are available in the SI. We note that the correlator changes both in amplitude and in extent when we approach the critical point. To quantify these changes we fit a 3 parameter function to in the form where all the fitting coefficients are functions of . In Fig.   we present the dependence of the amplitude , the constant and the correlation length .  It is interesting to notice that the constant decreases with the system size, presumably becoming irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit. The amplitude is still increasing with the system size, and it is difficult to assert whether it converges or not. On the other hand we can safely conclude that the data present a strong evidence for the increase in the correlation length; it is very likely that it should diverge in the thermodynamic limit.  A relevant question is whether one can define critical exponents that can be measured also in experimental situations, and whether such exponents can be computed from theory, even on the mean-field level. Clearly, the standard thermal mean-field approach cannot be employed, since averages here are computed over replicas at , and fluctuations due to quenched disorder are expected to dominate the thermal fluctuations that stem only from the mother super-cooled liquid from which the replicas at are created. Considerations of the effect of such fluctuations are beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere.">

<outline text="Physical interpretation" _note="To conclude this paper we present a physical interpretation to these new insights, connecting them to what is known about the mechanical yield in athermal amorphous solids. The most important characteristic of the mechanical yield in athermal amorphous solids is the change from plastic responses that are localized, typically in the form of Eshelby quadrupoles, to subextensive plastic events that are system spanning . The energy drops associated with the localized Eshelby quadrupoles are system size independent, scaling like where is the total number of particles in the system. Mechanical yield is associated with the spontaneous appearance of concatenated lines of quadrupoles (in 2 dimensions, or planes in 3 dimensions, ). The latter are associated with energy drops that are subextensive, scaling like in 2 dimensions. Importantly, the concatenated lines of quadrupoles change drastically the displacement field associated with the plastic events. Each quadrupole has an arm with a displacement field pointing outward and an arm with the displacement field pointing inward. When the quadrupole is isolated the displacement field decays algebraically to infinity. In contrast, when the quadrupoles are organized in the line there is a global connection between the outgoing direction of one quadrupole and the incoming direction of the next, making the displacement field strongly localized around the line of quadrupoles (or around a plane in 3 dimensions), and all the shear is there. This is a microscopic shear band. An example of the displacement field associated with such as system spanning event is shown in Fig.  , and see Ref.  for details. The main point of this paper is that the highly correlated phenomenon of such a shear band can only occur when there exists a correlation length that approaches the system size in magnitude. This is the correlation length that is identified in this paper, and cf. the upper panel of Fig.  .  To understand the relevance of the spinodal point for this scenario, we provide two figures that were obtained in Ref. .  In the upper panel of Fig.    one sees the order parameter as a function of , superimposed on the stress vs. strain curve of the system under study. The point “yield&quot; was obtained with the help of the results shown in the lower panel, in which the probability of observing is plotted for values of around the mechanical yield point . The yield itself is identified when the probability distribution function has two peaks of the same height. The spinodal point is at a slightly higher value of , where the peak occurring around high values of is about to disappear, with a characteristic spinodal vanishing of the slope. This is occurring in the present system around . Of course in the thermodynamic limit the whole range of values where the exchange of stability is occurring is becoming very narrow.  It is important to stress again that the ability to observe the divergence of the susceptibility and the correlation length due to the spinodal phenomenon stems from the fact that we deal with an athermal glassy system whose typical relaxation times are immense. In a liquid system the fluctuations would have caused the system to make the transition before the spinodal point is reached.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the yielding transition is a spinodal point with disorder, characterized by a criticality whose features can be picked up by suitable multi-point correlators whose expression can be obtained from replica theory. The treatment presented here pertains to an athermal setting, but an obvious direction for future research will be the application of these ideas to thermal glasses under shear ; in that case, the system will generally be able to escape through thermal activation from the high- minimum before this has a chance to flatten and the relative susceptibility to diverge. However, since the nucleation time will anyway be fairly long, one should anyway be able to observe TRANSIENT shear-bands/heterogeneities, as long as the temperature is low enough that nucleation does not take place until the system is close to the spinodal, which, interestingly, is precisely the behavior of transient shear bands as reported in . In this thermal setting, we expect that the study of the ideas presented in this paper will have to proceed much as it does in the case of dynamical heterogeneities around the MCT crossover, entailing for example the definition and study of time-dependent multi-point susceptibilities and correlators.">
