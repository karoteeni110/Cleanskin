<outline text="Proof of Lemma [lem:counts_before_succ]" _note="Let denote a distributed multivariate normal random variable. Let be a geometric variable denoting the number of consecutive independent trials until . Then observe that We want to bound the expected value of by a constant for all . Consider any integer , let , and let denote the MAXIMUM PREFERENCE of independent samples of , that is . We abbreviate as and as in the following. Then Using Fact  , this gives where the second inequality uses that and the last inequality uses that . Also, using Fact  , we have Substituting, we obtain and where is such that for . We observe that is required in order for the sum to converge.">
