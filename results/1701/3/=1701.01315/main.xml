    <title>Groupwise Structural Parcellation of the Cortex: A Sound Approach Based
on Logistic Models</title>
    <abstract>Current theories hold that brain function is highly related to
long-range physical connections through axonal bundles, namely EXTRINSIC
CONNECTIVITY. However, obtaining a groupwise cortical parcellation based
on extrinsic connectivity remains challenging. Current parcellation
methods are computationally expensive; need tuning of several parameters
or rely on ad-hoc constraints. Furthermore, none of these methods
present a model for the cortical extrinsic connectivity of the cortex.
To tackle these problems, we propose a parsimonious model for the
extrinsic connectivity and an efficient parceling technique based on
clustering of tractograms. Our technique allows the creation of single
subject and groupwise parcellations of the whole cortex. The
parcellations obtained with our technique are in agreement with
structural and functional parcellations in the literature. In
particular, the motor and sensory cortex are subdivided in agreement
with the human homunculus of Penfield. We illustrate this by comparing
our resulting parcels with the motor strip mapping included in the Human
Connectome Project data. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The human brain is arranged in areas based on criteria such as cytoarchitecture, functional specialization or axonal connectivity . Parceling the cortex into such areas and characterizing their interaction is key to understanding how the brain works. Nowadays it’s accepted that axonal connectivity plays a fundamental role in the interaction between brain regions . Moreover, current theories hold that long-range physical connections trough axonal bundles, namely EXTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY, are strongly related to brain function, for example, this has been shown in macaques . Therefore, understanding how the cortex is arranged based on its extrinsic connectivity can provide key information in unraveling the internal organization of the brain.  Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables the in vivo exploration of extrinsic connectivity and other aspects of white matter anatomy on the brain. However, in using diffusion MRI to infer long-distance connectivity, several challenges arise. A primary issue is the spatial resolution of diffusion imaging: it is several orders of magnitude coarser than axonal diameters (millimeters vs. micrometers) , making hard to infer some brain pathways. In addition, there is as yet no quantitative measure of the strength of connections from diffusion . Given these general limitations, obtaining a cortical parcellation based on extrinsic connectivity remains challenging . Moreover, most current parceling techniques compute either single-subject or groupwise parcellations. Single-subject techniques work by refining other parcellations , which introduces a bias in the resulting parcellation; parceling only part of the cortex  or using ad-hoc metrics to compare extrinsic connectivity . Meanwhile, existing groupwise methods rely on average connectivity profiles , which prevents obtaining single subject parcellations; seek a matching across subjects after independent parcellations , relying on possible noisy results, or need fine tuning of parameters, as the expected number of clusters to find .  In this work, we present a parsimonious model for the cortical connectivity alongside an efficient parceling technique based on it. We summarize both contributions in Fig.  . Our model assumes that the cortex is divided in patches of homogeneous extrinsic connectivity. That is, nearby neurons in the cortex share approximately the same long-range physical connections, we call this the LOCAL COHERENCE CRITERION. Our assumption is based on histological results in the macaque brain . Inspired by statistical models for clustered data , our model accounts for the variability in the axonal connections of neurons within a patch and for variability in patch boundaries across subjects. Our parceling technique allows us to create single subject and groupwise parcellations of the whole cortex in agreement with extant parcellations.  We validate our technique by taking advantage of data available from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Using our technique, we compute single subject and a groupwise parcellations. In this work we will focus on the groupwise case. For results of our method on the single-subject case please refer to . Here, we first assess the consistency of our groupwise parceling technique by comparing the groupwise parcellations of three disjoint groups of 46 subjects from the HCP. We also show that our technique computes a similar parcellation to the one obtained by when parceling only the frontal cortex. Later, to test the functional specialization of our frontal lobe parcels, we use a data-base of meta-analysis of fMRI studies , as in . After, we show that our groupwise parcels subdivide some well-known anatomical structures by comparing our results against Desikan’s atlas . Also, we show the functional specialization of some of our parcels by comparing against results from . Finally, we compare our groupwise parcellation of 138 subjects against the multi-modal parcellation of . We show that, while the parcellations boundaries differ, our parcels show similar or better functional specialization, specially for motor related tasks.  This work is organized as follows: In the Methods section we present our model for cortical connectivity and frame tractography within our model. Also, we present both our single-subject and groupwise case methodologies to parcellate the cortex. In the Experiments and Results section we present our results on HCP data. We then discuss our results and position ourselves with respect to the state of the art in the Discussion section. Finally, in the last section we provide our conclusions.">

  <outline text="Cortical Connectivity Model and Tractography" _note="Our model assumes that the cortex is divided in clusters of homogeneous extrinsic connectivity. That is, nearby neurons in the cortex share approximately the same long-ranged physical connections, we call this the LOCAL COHERENCE CRITERION. Our assumption is based on histological results in the macaque brain . As in clustered data models in statistics , we allow intra-cluster and across-subject variability in the connectivity. We formalize this concept as: where the set of points on the cortex is the disjoint union of each cluster and is the extrinsic connectivity fingerprint of a cluster. We will make the notion of variability explicit in eq.  . In this work, the connectivity fingerprint of a seed-point in the brain is a binary vector denoting to which other seed-points it is connected through axonal bundles. That is, the physical connections of a point in the brain are represented by its connectivity fingerprint .  Currently, the most common tool for estimating the extrinsic connectivity fingerprint of a point in vivo is probabilistic tractography . Given a seed-point in the brain, probabilistic tractography creates a TRACTOGRAM: an image where each voxel is valued with its probability of being connected to the seed through axonal bundles. One way of calculating these probabilities is with a Monte Carlo procedure, simulating the random walk of water particles through the white matter . Each one of these paths is known as a streamline. If we model these streamlines as Bernoulli trials, where we get a value for the connection from our seed with other points (1 if they connected by the streamline, 0 if not) , then, we can model the tractogram of the subject in the seed-point as: where is a Bernoulli random variable[^1] representing “the point of the subject is connected to the voxel &quot;. Each Bernoulli’s parameter () represents the probability of being connected, and is estimated as the proportion of success in the Bernoulli trials of each seed.  To formulate the tractogram in accordance to our hypothesis of cortical connectivity, we model it as a vector of random variables. In our model, each element in a tractogram comes from a random variable depending on the point’s cluster along with its intra-cluster and across-subject variability: in this case, the point belongs to the cluster ; represents the intra-cluster variability and represents the across-subject variability for the connectivity to voxel in the cluster .  Since each follows a Bernoulli distribution (Eq.  ) it’s difficult to find an explicit formulation for accounting for the variabilities. For this, we use the generalized linear model (GLM) theory. In this theory, the data is assumed to follow a linear form after being transformed with an appropriate link function . Using the following notation abuse: we derive from GLM a logistic random-effects model  for each point : where and represent the intra-cluster and across-subject variability respectively. According to GLM theory is the extrinsic connectivity fingerprint of cluster transformed:  The choice of logit as link function is based on the work of . In their work, show that logit function’s codomain is a Euclidean space, which allows us to transform and manipulate the tractograms in a well-known space.

  <outline text="Single Subject and Groupwise parceling Methodologies" _note="In the previous section, we hypothesized that the cortex is divided in clusters with homogeneous extrinsic connectivity, alongside intra-cluster and across-subject variability. In using the previous hypothesis, it is important to remark that we don’t have a priori knowledge of the cluster’s location or their variability. But, thanks to the proposed logistic random effects model, we formulated the problem of finding these clusters as a well-known clustering problem. This is because, after transforming the tractograms with the logit function as in eq.   they will be in a Euclidean space . Even more, eq.   states that the transformed tractograms come from a mixture of Gaussian distributions, e.g. it is a Gaussian mixture model.  To solve the Gaussian mixture model and find the clusters, we use a modified Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm. This was inspired by the method of . To enforce the local coherence criterion we also modify the algorithm to accept one parameter: the minimum size of the resulting clusters. Clusters smaller than this size are merged with neighbors, i.e. physically close clusters in the cortex. As we are working in a Euclidean space, we use Ward’s Hierarchical Clustering method . This method creates clusters with minimum within-cluster variance. The method’s result is a dendrogram: a structure that comprises different levels of granularity for the same parcellation. This allows us to explore different parcellation granularities by choosing cutting criteria, without the need of recomputing each time.  The main advantage of the model we proposed in this work is that it allows us to create a groupwise parcellation using linear operations. Assuming direct seed correspondence across subjects, as in the HCP data set, our model lets us remove the subject variability of each seed’s tractogram by calculating the expected value across subjects: where the last equality is due to (Eq.  ). Since in our model the variabilities are normally distributed (Eq.  ), we can estimate the expected value across subjects by averaging a seed’s tractograms across subjects. This allows us to create population-representative tractograms for each seed free of across-subject variability, which then can be clustered to create a groupwise parcellation.">

<outline text="Experiments and Results" _note="In the previous section we presented a model for the cortical extrinsic connectivity and a clustering technique to parcellate the whole brain. Our technique allows us to create single subject and groupwise parcellations, encoded with different levels of granularity in a dendrogram. Now, we show the results of applying our technique over the HCP dataset. First, we explain how the preprocessing step of tractography was made. Then, we elaborate in detail how we applied our technique. Later, we show that our groupwise technique creates results consistent when parceling different groups. Also, we show that our techniques creates parcels in accordance with those by when parceling only the frontal lobe. Then, we present a proof-of-principle that our parcels are related to brain anatomy and functional specialization. Most of the results in this section are focused in the groupwise case, for further information on the single-subject technique please refer to .

    <outline text="Human Connectome Project Dataset" _note="A total of 138 subjects (65 males and 73 females, ages 31-35) were randomly selected from the group S500 of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). For information on the acquisition protocols please refer to . Every subject has been already preprocessed with the HCP minimum pipeline . Also, each subject’s cortical surface is coregistered and represented as a triangular mesh of approximately 32000 vertices per hemisphere . For each vertex, the corresponding label from Desikan’s Atlas is known . Finally, the group S500 contains tfMRI information representing the average response to functional stimuli in 100 unrelated subjects (U100).">

    <outline text="Probabilistic Tractography" _note="To create the tractograms of each subject, we performed Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) based tractography  from a dense set of points in the cortex. Specifically, since each subject has a mesh representing their gray-matter/white-matter interface , we used their vertices as seeds to create tractograms. Vertices corresponding to the medial wall were excluded. To avoid superficial cortico-cortical fibers , we shrank each of the 138 surfaces into the white matter. For each subject, we fitted a CSD model  to their diffusion data using Dipy (version 0.11)  and created 5000 streamlines per seed-voxel using the implementation of probabilistic tractography in Dipy. Later, we created a tractogram as in (Eq.  ) by calculating for each seed the fraction of they particles that visited other seed-voxel.">

  <outline text="Parceling Subjects From the Human Connectome Project" _note="After performing tractography, we applied our parceling technique over each subject in our HCP sample. Specifically, we first transformed each tractogram with the logit function as in eq.  . Then, we clustered the tractograms of each subject using the modified AHC algorithm while imposing a minimum cluster size of in the finest granularity. Two examples of obtained single-subject parcellations at a granularity of 55 parcels are shown in fig.  . To create the groupwise parcellation, we took advantage of the vertex correspondence across subjects in the HCP data set . After transforming the tractograms with the logit transform, we computed the average connectivity of each seed by averaging its tractograms across-subject. Then, we computed the groupwise parcellation by clustering the averaged tractograms with our proposed technique (sec.  ). The obtained groupwise parcellation at a granularity of 55 parcels is shown in fig.  .  ">

  <outline text="Groupwise Parcellation Technique Consistency" _note="To study the consistency of our technique, we randomly divided our HCP subject sample in 3 disjoint groups, trying to maintain the same proportion of males and females on each. The resulting groups had: 24 females, 22 males (group A); 23 females, 23 males (group B) and 28 females, 18 males (group C). For each group we computed their groupwise parcellation. The resulting parcellations at two different levels of granularity are shown in fig.  .  To study the similarity between the obtained groupwise parcellations, we compared them at different levels of granularity using the adjusted Rand index . To have a baseline for the comparisons, we generated random parcellations of the cortex and computed the similarity between them. We computed two types of random parcellations: The first one is an homogeneous random parcellation with parcels, inspired in a method used by . To compute it, we start by choosing starting points in the cortex, then, we randomly expand each parcel on the cortex. By comparing these random parcellations between them we compute the minimum obtainable Rand index by mere chance at each level of granularity. In the second type of random parcellation, we simulate the behavior of our technique. For this, we create a parcellation with parcels and then, we iteratively merge two parcels chosen at random until all the parcels are merged in one. By comparing these random parcellations between them we obtain the minimum obtainable Rand index by a random Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. Examples of these random parcellations can be seen in Fig  . The baselines presented in fig.   (yellow and violet lines) were computed by comparing of these random parcels at different levels of granularity.  The result of comparing the groupwise parcellations of each group appear in fig.  . The figure shows that the similarity between our groupwise parcellations (lines red, green and blue) are significantly higher than the baselines (violet and yellow). That is, the similarity between our parcellations differs (for most cases) more than 3 standard deviations from the baselines’ mean. Moreover, the similarity between our results differs more than 4 standard deviations from the comparison between synthetic hierarchical parcels. This results show that our groupwise parceling technique creates consistent parcellations.  ">

  <outline text="Relationship with a frontal lobe parcellation" _note="Here we assess the agreement of our technique with an state-of-the-art extrinsic connectivity parceling technique. We do so by using our technique to parcellate the frontal lobe and compare our result against that of . In their work, use a principal component analysis (PCA) statistical framework to parcellate the frontal lobe. They obtain a parcellation with 12 parcels. Then, they show that each one of these parcels possess a functional specialization by using the Decode tool[^1] from Neurosynth . Thiebaut’s parcellation is currently available in Neurovault as an annotated volume[^2], registered on the Colin27 template . We downloaded this parcellation and projected its parcels into a dense mesh representing the cortex of the Colin27 template. The dense mesh had the same amount of vertices as our chosen HCP subjects, and such vertices were coregistered with the HCP subjects’ cortical surfaces ones.  From the Desikan Atlas of each of our HCP subjects, we derived a groupwise mask for the frontal lobe. Then, we computed a groupwise parcellation with our technique, using only the tractograms in the mask. Figure   shows both the parcellation downloaded from Neurovault and our groupwise parcellation projected in the Colin template cortical surface. The figure shows our parcellation with 10 parcels since this level of granularity showed the best Rand index against the Thiebaut’s parcellation. The colors of each parcel in our groupwise parcellation were picked in base to the position and amount of overlapping with the Thiebaut’s parcels on the surface. While the similarity according to the Rand index is not significantly high (), some visual similarity can be observed on the obtained parcellation, particularly in the blue, yellow, orange and green parcels. Moreover, as shown in table 1, our parcels show the same or even a higher level of functional specialization when processed with Neurosynth.  To study the consistency of our result we computed the frontal lobe groupwise parcellation in each of the 3 disjoint groups from the previous experiment. Figure    shows the three obtained parcellation alongside the Thiebaut’s one. The obtained parcels show consistency, obtaining an adjusted Rand index score of between them.

  <outline text="Anatomical Relationship and Functional Specialization of Our Parcels" _note="Here we present a proof of concept that our technique creates parcels within anatomical boundaries and with functional meaning. To do so, first, we extracted a parcellation with 55 parcels from the groupwise parcellation computed from the 138 subjects. This was made to get a parcellation with coarse granularity while having at least the amount of parcels in the anatomical atlas of Desikan  (36 parcels). We compare this extracted parcellation against the Desikan Atlas and a functional study made to every subject in the HCP .">
    <outline text="Relationship with Anatomical Boundaries" _note="To assess if some anatomical structures were present in the dendrogram and if our resulting parcels were subdividing them, we compared our extracted parcellation with the Desikan atlas . To do so, we projected the Desikan regions over our parcels and then calculated: how many of our parcels were contained by a anatomical region in more than a , and which anatomical regions were contained inside of one of our parcels. Using this criterion, the Insula; Cingulate; Lateral-Occipital; Fusiform; Superior Frontal; Lingual; Sensory and Motor Cortex appear to be found as shown in Fig.  .">

    <outline text="Functional Specialization." _note="To study the relationship between our parcels and brain function, we projected our parcels over z-score maps representing responses to functional stimuli . These maps are available as part of the HCP data, and represent the average activation of 100 subjects. In particular, we used the maps related to the following tasks: right hand, foot and tongue movement; face, shape recognition and story categorization. For information on the functional tasks, acquisition and processing of this data please refer to . Figure   shows our parcels projected over contrasts in motor tasks. In particular, our parcels are projected over the following contrasts: tongue-average; hand movement-average and foot movement-average. Figure   shows our parcels projected over contrasts in cognitive tasks: face-shape recognition; shape-face recognition and short-story categorization. The figures show a good overlap between our parcels and the regions with maximum activation of each task. In both figures the distribution of z-scores inside of specific regions are shown as histograms. Further information about the z-score is present in tables 2 and 3. These tables show that our parcels contain zero or few negatives values; that the mean of their contained z-score is always positive and also, that many of those parcels enclose the maximum achievable z-score.

  <outline text="Relationship With a Multi-Modal Parcellation of the Cortex" _note="Finally, we study the (dis)similarities between our groupwise parcellation and that of . In their work, compute a parcellation of the whole cortex using information from different MRI modalities. In particular, they use information from task functional MRI; resting state functional MRI; myelin maps computed from T1 and T2 images and cortical thickness. It is important to remark that dMRI data, in which our work is solely based, was not used to construct their parcellation.  To compare our results against Glasser’s atlas, we first extracted a parcellation of 180 parcels from the groupwise dendrogram of our 138 HCP subjects. That is, we extracted a parcellation with the same number of parcels as Glasser’s one. Figure   show both parcellations side by side. We compared both parcellations using the adjusted Rand Index, obtaining a score of 0.28. Such low score indicates that there’s almost no similarity between our result and that of . Also, there’s no relationship with our groupwise parcellation with 55 parcels used in the previous section since Glasser’s parcels (finest) do not subdivide ours (coarsest). Since Glasser’s parcellation comes from functional information in the HCP, we studied the functional specialization of its parcels in the same manner as previous section. Figure   shows the histogram of z-score contained for some parcels when using the same maps as in section Functional Activations. It’s important to remark that the z-score maps used come from responses to functional stimuli of HCP subjects . In particular, histograms a; b and c in fig.   show that their subdivisions of the sensori-motor cortex contain a wide range of z-scores, centered in zero.  ">

<outline text="Discussion" _note="In this work we presented a parsimonious statistical model for long-ranged axonal connectivity. Our model (section  ), assumes that the cortex is divided in patches of homogeneous extrinsic connectivity, as histological results showed in the macaque brain . By borrowing ideas from statistical clustered data models , our model accounts for the variability in the axonal connections of a patch’s neurons and for variability in patch boundaries across subjects.  Taking advantage of our proposed model, in Section   we presented an efficient technique to parcellate the cortex based on its extrinsic connectivity. Our technique uses only dMRI information, without the need of relying on initial parcellations . Also, our technique allows parcellation of the whole cortex, overcoming the problem of working with only part of it . Additionally, our technique allows creation of both single subject and groupwise parcellations independently, avoiding the need to impose constraints between them .  Inspired by , our technique uses Hierarchical Clustering to comprise multiple granularities of the same parcellation in a dendrogram. The fundamental difference is how we compare and merge tractograms during the clustering process. use Centroid Clustering  with the cosine distance. This can lead to an erroneous parcellation since the centroid criterion doesn’t minimize the cosine distance between points. Also, this method makes dendrograms with inversions , which are then removed heuristically. In our case, using a Logistic Random Effect model (eq.  ) allowed us to transform the tractograms into a Eucliden space (sec.  ). Then, we use Ward’s Hierarchical method , which creates clusters with minimum intra-cluster variance. We can use this algorithm since its only hypothesis is that the features to cluster are in a Euclidean space. One advantage of using Ward’s method is that we can use the Lance and Williams formula to update the disimilarity between tractograms at each iteration. The formula gives us the disimilarity between the new centroid created at each step and the rest of the existing tractograms in constant time. As far as we know there’s no Lance and Williams formula when using the cosine distance with the centroid linkage. This allows us to lower the time complexity of our algorithm with respect to Moreno-Dominguez. Another advantage of using Ward’s clustering is that our resulting dendrograms do not have inversions, which means that we don’t need to post-process them. As in , we also create the dendrogram using only one comprehensive parameter: the minimum size of each cluster. This parameter imposes the local coherence criterion. Using Hierarchical Clustering allows us to overcome the need of other techniques  to specify an expected number of clusters, which imposes the need to recompute the whole pipeline each time a new parcellation is required, and, using our Logistic Random Effects Model, allows us to use a hierarchical clustering algorithm which minimizes the intra-cluster variance.">

Our whole-cortex groupwise parcellation reaches a maximum consistency score when the cortex is divided in 6 regions, see Fig.  . As seen in Fig.  , these parcellations are consistent with specific anatomo/functional networks: the frontal lobe section anterior to the prefrontal cortex is shown in yellow; the sensorimotor area is shown in cyan, the cingulate area is shown in beige; the fronto-occipital connection in orange, and the temporo-parietal system in pink.">

  <outline text="Our Method Creates Several Parcels in Agreement with Brain Anatomy." _note="We showed that many of our parcels are in agreement with brain anatomy. In particular, we showed that in our groupwise parcellation, with 55 parcels, the following anatomical structures appeared to be found: Cingulate; Insula; Lateral-Occipital; Fusiform; Superior Frontal; Lingual; Motor and Sensory cortex. Here we discuss why some of these parcels were found and how are their conectivity fingerprints. In the case of the Cingulate, its fingerprint, shown in fig.  , is strongly related with the Cingulate Fascicle (CF) pathway. This is consistent with the fact that the seeds located in the Cingulate will end up into the CF after being pushed in the white-matter. In the case of the Insula, each subdivision showed a specific pattern of connectivity as shown in fig.  . These parcels show a gradient of connections from the occipital lobe to the frontal lobe consistent with that of . In the Lateral-Occipital region, we see a specific pattern of local connectivity which cannot be attributed to gyral bias since the Lateral-Occipital covers many sulci and gyrus. In the case of the fusiform, it is almost completely contained in one of our parcellations, which goes from the Fusiform up to the Lateral-Occipital (fig.  ). This could add evidence to the hypothesis that the Fusiform plays a role in visual tasks . Finally, the Motor and Sensory cortex appear to be found. While the appearance of each gyri is most probably because of gyral bias , the parcels inside them show specific patterns of structural connectivity (fig.  ), and, as seen in section 3.5.2, functional specialization.

For some parcels there were not even negative values. Moreover, several of the histograms on figures   and   show a high frequency of z-score values greater than 5, which indicate a significant correlation with functional activation.

It’s important to remark that our parcels are purely based on extrinsic connectivity, meanwhile those of do not use dMRI information. Glasser’s parcels are mostly based on myelin and functional information. In particular, their subdivision of the sensori-motor cortex (green parcels in fig.  ) is mostly based in Myelin maps as shown in Figure 4.a of . Because of this, their parcels in the sensori-motor cortex contain a wide range of z-scores when compared with responses to functional stimuli as shown by histograms a; b and c in fig.  . In contrast, our parcels in the sensori-motor cortex, for a coarser parcellation, show a good overlap with function and are in agreement with the motor strip mapping as discussed in the previous section.

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="Understanding how the brain is structurally organized and its relationship with functionality is an open question in neuroscience. Recent advances in acquisition and modeling techniques on dMRI have facilitated to study axonal connectivity in the brain. However, parceling the whole cortex based on a structural criterion remained challenging. In this work we presented a connectivity model, framed tractography within our model and presented a parceling technique that allows parcellation of the whole brain in both single subject and groupwise cases. Our technique, along with the obtained groupwise parcellation, could have major implications both in cognitive neuroscience and in development-aging studies. At the same time, our technique could help to lower the gap between structural connectivity and brain function, since some of our pure structural parcels showed good overlapping with responses to functional tasks.  Both our parceling tool and the obtained groupwise parcellation are or will be soon freely available in GitHub and Neurovault. These tools provide a sound basis for new studies on human cognition, brain development, aging and disease. These tools can create fine parcellations of cortical areas, improving our knowledge about cortical organization. Future comparison with functional connectivity could lead to finally unraveling the link between axonal connectivity and brain function.\ [**Acknowledgments:** This work has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ERC Advanced Grant agreement No 694665 : CoBCoM).
