    <title>Extracting the Groupwise Core Structural Connectivity Network: Bridging
Statistical and Graph-Theoretical Approaches</title>
    <abstract>Finding the common structural brain connectivity network for a given
population is an open problem, crucial for current neuroscience. Recent
evidence suggests thereâ€™s a tightly connected network shared between
humans. Obtaining this network will, among many advantages, allow us to
focus cognitive and clinical analyses on common connections, thus
increasing their statistical power. In turn, knowledge about the common
network will facilitate novel analyses to understand the
structure-function relationship in the brain.

In this work, we present a new algorithm for computing the core
structural connectivity network of a subject sample combining graph
theory and statistics. Our algorithm works in accordance with novel
evidence on brain topology. We analyze the problem theoretically and
prove its complexity. Using 309 subjects, we show its advantages when
used as a feature selection for connectivity analysis on populations,
outperforming the current approaches. </abstract>
