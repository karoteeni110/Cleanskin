<outline text="Consistency of the Extracted Graph" _note="To compare the stability across different algorithms for CSCN, we use an analysis based on Wassermann et al. : we randomly take subsets of subjects each and computed the core graphs for all subsets. We then compute the number of UNSTABLE CONNECTIONS: connections that present in at least one core graph but not in all of them. Finally, in Table   we report each algorithm’s STABILITY:  This measure quantifies the CSCN consistency across subsamples. Due to the homogeneity of our sample, we expect the CSCNs obtained by an algorithm to be similar across subsamples. Hence, a stabler algorithm is preferable.">

<outline text="Predicting Handedness-Specific Connectivity" _note="We evaluate performance of the methods by using the generated core graphs as a feature selection for handedness specific connectivity. We use a nested Leave--Out procedure: the outer loop performs model selection on of the subjects using the core graph algorithm and the inner loop performs model fitting and prediction using the selected features.  Specifically, we first take subjects randomly and compute the core graph for those subjects using the three different algorithms. Then we add the weights for the selected edges for each subject, and select the features that are more determinant of handedness using a linear least-squares regression and the Bonferroni correction for multiple hypotheses. This experiment is repeated 500 times. We quantify the amount of features that are selected after each procedure, which indicates how useful is the core graph algorithm for selecting the edges related to handedness. We show the results in Table  .  To evaluate the prediction, we randomly take of the remaining subjects and fit a linear model on the features to predict connectivity weights using the handedness of each subject. Finally, we predict the values of the features from the handedness in the subjects left out. We quantify the quality of the linear model fitting Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and of the prediction performance with the mean squared error (MSE) of the prediction. For both measures a lower value indicates better performance. The outer loop is performed 500 times and the inner loop 100 times per outer loop, which totals 50,000 experiments. We show the results of this experiments in Fig.  .">
