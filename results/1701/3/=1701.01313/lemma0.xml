<outline text="Intercrosses and Countercrosses" _note="Let be an interval. Let be two halfspaces of . We say that and are ADJACENT if there is no halfspace such that . An with respect to is a (non empty) cross decomposed as two disjoints sets such that  every element of is transverse to ,  every element of is transverse to and disjoint from .  Let be two halfspaces in and let be an for and . A is a cross such that:  ,  if , there exist elements and such that ,  if , then ,  there exists an element such that .  Given two halfspaces , we say that is LOCALLY PARALLEL to if they are adjacent and for any between them and any other adjacent pair admits an of dimension greater or equal to the one of .  We emphasize the fact that these definitions are oriented. In particular, if is locally parallel to in , it does not imply that is locally parallel to with respect to the inverse orientation of .    Let be an interval, and let be a non-maximal halfspace. Then there exists an adjacent halfspace , for which any admits a .  We call such a halfspace a .  Let be the set of halfspaces adjacent to and above . If one element of does not share an with then it verifies the Lemma.  Otherwise for each , let be an for the pair . To prove the lemma we need to show that one of these admits a .  Notice that if some is empty, then is a for . Similarly, if is not empty and there is no halfspace in which is strictly below , then is a for . We thus can assume that for all the set is non-empty and there exists such that (and in particular, is non-empty).  Notice that for any there exists such that , and therefore for some , we have . This implies that .  Let be a minimal subset of such that .  For any proper non-empty subset , there exists such that  By contradiction, assume that for all , we have . But this implies that But since verifies , it would imply that verifies which contradicts the minimality of .  Let us now construct a for some element of . Choose some , and set and . We will construct subsets , of size , and crosses inductively, so that they satisfy:  ,  , and   is strictly contained in .  We construct from in the following way. By the claim there exists such that an element of belongs to . If , then is a for , and we are done. Otherwise , and we can define and accordingly .  If we did not find a in the process, we end up (after steps) with and . But since , is transverse to every element of and therefore (which satisfies ) is a for .">
