<outline text="Reductions for sequences" _note="The goal of this section is to describe the various reductions we will use when considering sequences of pairs of halfspaces and crosses. We assume throughout that the intervals involved have dimension at most .  A CHAIN of halfspaces is a sequence of halfspaces such that either , or . We say that the chain is INCREASING, DECREASING, or CONSTANT respectively.  A CHAIN OF -TUPLES is a sequence of -tuples of halfspaces such that for all , the sequence is a chain.  A sequence of crosses is REGULARLY ORDERED if all crosses have same dimension and if there exists a chain of -tuples , such that . It is REGULARLY INCREASING, if non of the chains are decreasing. A SUBCHAIN of a regularly ordered sequence of crosses is one of the chains .    For all there exists such that any sequence of (not necessarily distinct) halfspaces contains a subsequence which is a chain of length .  By applying Observation   several times one can deduce the following lemmas.    For every and every there exists such that every sequence of -tuples of halfspaces. Then there exist subsequence of -tuples which is a chain of -tuples.  The following lemma, which follows from Ramsey’s Theorem, shows that for an increasing chain of pairs one can reduce to one of two extreme scenarios:  a STAIRCASE is an increasing chain of pairs such that for all and for all ,  a LADDER is an increasing chain of pairs such that for all and for all .    For every there exists such that for every set of distinct adjacent pairs of halfspaces there exists a increasing chain sequence of pairs which is either a staircase or a ladder.  By applying Lemma   we may assume that is a chain, and by reordering we may assume that that both subchain are increasing (notice that bounds the number of distinct adjacent halfspaces to a given halfspace ). Let us consider the graph whose vertices are the pairs , and whose edges are the pairs and () such that crosses . By Ramsey’s theorem there exists such that either there exists a -clique or a -independent set, these correspond to the staircase and ladder scenarios.  Given a chain of pairs and a chain of halfspaces . we say that the chain of halfspaces is TAME with respect to the chain of pairs if for all , we have . The chain of halfspaces is WILD if for all .  Let be a chain of pairs and be a regularly ordered chain of crosses. The chain of crosses is WEAKLY TAME if for each halfspace we have . It is TAME if one of its subchains is tame. It is -TAME if for all subchain of halfspaces , either the chain is tame or for all , .  Note that in the case of crosses, tame and -tame imply weakly tame. However since may be empty, -tame does not imply tame.    For all there exists such that for every sequence of crosses of dimension there exists a regularly increasing sequence of crosses of dimension such that if have any of the following properties  tame;  ;  having a subchain such that ;  with respect to , then have the same properties with respect to . If moreover are weakly tame then one can choose so that every subchain of is either tame of wild.  By applying Lemma   we may pass to a subsequence of crosses which is regularly ordered. By abuse of notation we will assume that are regularly ordered. Let us consider the crosses The sequence is a regularly increasing sequence of crosses. Moreover, each of the three properties in the lemma pass on to .  As in the proof of Lemma  , an application of Ramsey’s theorem shows that for big enough, we can pass to a subsequence of crosses, which by abuse of notation we will denote again by such that every subchain of is either tame or wild. Since the three properties pass to subsequences they remain true for . Note that weak tameness is needed to insure that each is below or transverse to , and thus is not above all .    Let be a staircase, and let be a tame regularly increasing sequence of crosses of dimension such that any subchain is either tame or wild. Assume that each cross contains a halfspace such that . Then there exists a regularly increasing sequence of crosses of dimension which are tame and -tame , with tame or wild subchains with respect to the chain of pairs of even indices where .  Let (resp. ) be the set of all wild (resp. tame) halfspaces in . Then the sequence of crosses which are defined by are for . The set is a cross because an element in cannot be strictly below an element of by the regular increasing order on , and it cannot be strictly above an element of since it is below and every element of crosses . Moreover elements of intersect , elements of are not smaller or equal to since they intersect , and cannot be above since . Therefore is an .  Since are tame, the chain of crosses with odd indices is tame with respect to the subsequence of of even indexed pairs. It is also -tame because the only halfspaces that do not intersect are coming from .">
