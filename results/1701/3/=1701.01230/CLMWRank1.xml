For , define the polynomial in and the binary form in by and Define  Let , . We consider the family of Diophantine inequalities where the unknowns take their values in the set of elements in such that and . It follows from the results in that the set of solutions is finite. However, the proof in relies on Schmidt’s subspace theorem, which is not effective. Here we give an effective upper bound for in terms of , , and , by using lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms.  For , , we stand to the notation for .  Here is our main result.    There exists an effectively computable constant , depending only on , such that any solution of , which verifies and , satisfies  Under the assumptions of Theorem , with the help of the upper bound for the height of the form , it follows from the bound (3.2) in (see also ) that with Combining this upper bound with our Theorem provides an effective upper bound for .  For , set and assume Our proof actually gives a much stronger estimate for , see Theorem , which involves some extra parameter defined by Notice that the condition means and that the condition means ; using Lemma , we deduce that each of these two conditions implies that is odd, hence that the field is almost totally imaginary (namely, with a single real embedding) – compare with .    There exists a positive effectively computable constant , depending only on , with the following property. Let satisfy Then  On the one hand, using Lemma (§), we will prove in § that which will enable us to deduce Theorem from Theorem . On the other hand, thanks to ), we have . In general, we expect to be as large as (which is therefore the maximum possible), in which case the conclusion of Theorem becomes with a positive effective constant depending only on . In §, we give a few examples where this last bound is valid.  In Theorem , the hypothesis that is not a root of unity cannot be omitted. Here is an example with . Let be the cyclotomic polynomial of index and degree (Euler totient function). Let be a primitive –th root of unity. Set and . For with , the irreducible polynomial of is nothing else than . Hence, if the equation has a solution with , then for infinitely many the twisted Thue equation has also the solution , since . For instance, when , we have and the equation has the solutions , , , . The main result of , which deals only with non totally real cubic equations, is a special case of Theorem ; the “constants” in depend on and , while here they depend only on . The main result of deals with Thue equations twisted by a set of units which is not supposed to be a group of rank , but it involves an assumption (namely that at least two of the conjugates of have a modulus as large as a positive power of ) which we do not need here. Our Theorem also improves the main result of : we remove the assumption that the unit is totally real (besides, the result of is not explicit in terms of the heights and regulator). We also notice that the part of Theorem 1.1 of follows from our Theorem . The main result of does not assume that the twists are done by a group of units of rank , but it needs a strong assumption which does not occur here, namely that the field has at most one real embedding.  We conclude this §  with some more definitions and properties.  When is a polynomial in one variable of degree with coefficients in and leading coefficient , the (usual) height of is the maximum of the absolute values of the coefficients of , while the Mahler measure of is where are the roots of in .  Let us recall[^1] that the logarithmic height of an algebraic number of degree is where is the Mahler measure of the irreducible polynomial of . We have (see , Annex to Chapter 3, [INEQUALITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT HEIGHTS OF A POLYNOMIAL,]{} pp. 113–114; see also ). The second upper bound in could be replaced by the sharper one but we will not need it.  Let be a unit of degree and conjugates with so that .
