<outline text="Introduction" _note="The main aim of this paper is to introduce Two Parameter Pochhammer Symbol, Two Parameter Gamma Function and Two Parameter Beta Function. p - k Gamma Function is the deformation of the classical Gamma Function, such that as and as .\ In section 2, we defined Two Parameter Pochhammer Symbol denoted as , with its convergent conditions. Two Parameter Pochhammer Symbol is the deformation of the classical Pochhammer Symbol, such that as and as Also we derived two parameter Pochhammer symbol in terms of the elementary symmetric function, and evaluate it’s derivative identities. It is most natural to relate the two parameter Pochhammer symbol to the two parameter Gamma Function is defined. We evaluate integral representation of two parameter Gamma Function, also represent two parameter Gamma Function into different infinite product forms and so many recurrence relations are evaluated.\ In section 3, we defined two parameter Beta Function and two parameter Psi Function. Also evaluate some recurrence relations and functional relation with classical Beta Function.\ Section 4, deal with the definition of Hypergeometric function with Two Parameter Pochhammer Symbol, known as p-k Hypergeometric function. Also we evaluate the Differential Equation, Functional relation with Classical Hypergeometric function and Integral Representation of p-k Hypergeometric function.\ Throughout this paper Let be the sets of complex numbers, positive real numbers, real part of complex number, negative integer and natural numbers respectively.">
