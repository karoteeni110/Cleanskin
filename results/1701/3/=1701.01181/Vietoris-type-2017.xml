<outline text="Introduction" _note="In 1975, M. M. Choban introduced a new topology on the set of all closed subsets of a topological space for obtaining a generalization of the famous Kolmogoroff Theorem on operations on sets. This new topology is similar to the upper Vietoris topology but is weaker than it. In 1998, G. Dimov and D. Vakarelov defined another new hypertopology, which turned out to be a generalized version of the Choban topology, and called it a [TYCHONOFF-TYPE HYPERTOPOLOGY]{} (it could be also called an [UPPER-VIETORIS-TYPE HYPERTOPOLOGY]{}); they used it for proving an isomorphism theorem for the category of all Tarski consequence systems. Later on, the Tychonoff-type hypertopology was studied in details in . Further, in , a new lower-Vietoris-type hypertopology was introduced and studied. In this talk we define a new Vietoris-type hypertopology. We study it and show that, in general, it is different from the Vietoris topology. Also, some of the results of E. Michael about the hyperspaces with Vietoris topology are extended to analogous results for the hyperspaces with Vietoris-type topology.
