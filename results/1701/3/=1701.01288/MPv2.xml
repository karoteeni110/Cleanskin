The long-term goal is to understand the local dynamics of , , near and . More precisely, we are interested in the features of the maximal invariant set where is the neighborhood of described above.  Note that the maximal invariant set is a horseshoe corresponding to the natural (hyperbolic) continuation of .  It is not hard to see that when .

Actually, it was conjectured in that the stable, resp. unstable, sets of non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes are REALLY small: their Hausdorff dimensions should be STRICTLY smaller than , and, in fact, close to the “expected” dimension , resp. , where , resp. , is a quantity introduced in (close to , resp. ) measuring the transverse dimension of the stable, resp. unstable, set of the “main non-uniformly hyperbolic part” of .

  <outline text="Outline of the proof of the main result" _note="The stable of a non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe is naturally decomposed into a “well-behaved” part and an “exceptional” part (cf. Subsection 11.6 of and/or Section   below).  Roughly speaking, the well-behaved part of consists of points captured by “stable curves” obtained as the intersections of decreasing sequences of certain domains (“strips”) where adequate iterates of the dynamics behave like “affine hyperbolic maps” (in appropriate coordinates).  From these features of the dynamics on the well-behaved part of , it is possible to show that its decomposition into stable curves is a lamination with -leaves and Lipschitz holonomy (cf. Subsection 10.5 of ) whose transverse Hausdorff dimension is close to the stable dimension of the initial horseshoe (cf. Theorem 4 in Subsection 10.10 of ).  In particular, the well-behaved part of has Hausdorff dimension , and, hence, our task consists into studying the geometry of the exceptional part of .  In other words, the proof of Theorem   is reduced to show that the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional part of is .  By definition, the exceptional part of consists of points whose forward orbits get “very close” to the “critical locus” (of tangencies) infinitely many times. In fact, between “affine-like hyperbolic” iterations, the forward orbit of a point in visits a sequence of domains (“parabolic cores of strips ”) close to the critical locus whose “widths” decay with a DOUBLE EXPONENTIAL rate (cf. Lemma 24 of ).  The scenario described in the previous paragraph imposes STRONG GEOMETRICAL CONSTRAINTS on . For the sake of comparison, it is worth to point out that the forward orbit of a point in the stable set of a UNIFORMLY hyperbolic horseshoe visits a sequence of “strips” (cylinders of a Markov partition) whose “widths” decay with an EXPONENTIAL rate. In particular, this suggests that is very small when compared with the well-behaved part of .  We show that by combining the geometrical constraints on its forward iterates described above with the following simple argument.  We know that, between affine-like iterations, the forward images of a point in under the dynamics fall in a sequence of strips , , whose widths decay with a double exponential rate. By fixing large and decomposing the strip into squares, we obtain a covering of very small diameter of the image of under some positive iterate of the dynamics.  Now, we want to use negative iterates of the dynamics to bring this covering of back to . On one hand, we observe that each square becomes a strip under affine-like iterates of the dynamics. On the other hand, these strips might get folded during non-affine-like iterations (when the strips visit the parabolic cores of ). Since these folding effects can accumulate very quickly, it is not easy to keep control of their fine geometry in our way back from to .  Fortunately, if one wants just to prove that , then we can simply “forget” about the fine details of the geometries of these folded strips inside the , , by thinking of them as “fat strips”. In other words, when the strips acquire “parabolic shapes” due to the folds occuring inside ’s, we treat these “parabolic shapes” as NEW strips, we decompose them into NEW squares and we bring back each of these squares INDIVIDUALLY under the dynamics. Of course, the number of squares increases SIGNIFICANTLY each time we perform this procedure, but we will see that the resulting cover of has a MILD cardinality (in comparison with its diamater) thanks to the double exponential decay of the widths of ’s and the affine-like features of the dynamics between consecutive passages through the parabolic cores of ’s. In particular, by letting vary, this argument will provide a sequence of covers of whose diameters approach zero allowing to conclude that , and, A FORTIORI, the proof of Theorem  .">

  <outline text="Strongly regular parameters" _note="Up to a reparametrization, we can assume that the parameter coordinate of the -parameter family is normalized by the relative speed at the quadratic tangency: in other words, is the (oriented) distance between a piece of near and the tip of the parabolic arc consisting of a piece of near (see Section 4 of for more details).  The STRONGLY REGULAR PARAMETERS in are defined via an inductive scheme. Roughly speaking, we consider two very small constants and we define a sequence of scales , . The inductive scheme begins with the CANDIDATE interval . At the th step of the inductive scheme, we divide the selected candidate intervals of the previous step into disjoint candidates of lengths . Then, each of these candidate intervals passes a STRONG REGULARITY TEST: the candidates passing the test are selected for the next (th) step while the candidates failing the test are discarded.  We will discuss some of the requirements in the strong regularity tests later, but for now let us mention that the precise definition of these tests in DEPENDS on the condition on the stable dimension and the unstable dimension of the horseshoe , i.e., For this reason, we will always assume that the initial horseshoe is slightly thick in the sense that the condition is satisfied.  In this setting, the STRONGLY REGULAR PARAMETERS are defined as those parameters belonging to a decreasing sequence of candidate intervals passing the strong regularity tests, i.e., where are a selected candidate interval for the step with .  The “non-uniform hyperbolicity” of for strongly regular parameters is ensured by the (very intricate) nature of the strong regularity tests applied to the candidate intervals with . We will come back to this point later.  Of course, the notion of strong regularity tests in is interesting for at least two reasons. Firstly, it is sufficiently rich to guarantee several nice properties of “non-uniform hyperbolicity” of for strongly regular parameters. Secondly, it is also a sufficiently mild constraint satisfied by a set of large measure of parameters. More precisely, it is shown in Corollary 15 of that the set of strongly regular parameters has Lebesgue measure .  Before describing the nature of strong regularity tests, we will need the preparatory material from the next three subsections where an adequate class of AFFINE-LIKE ITERATES of will be attached to each candidate interval .">

In other terms, we choose a finite system of smooth charts indexed by a finite alphabet with the properties that these charts depend smoothly on , the intervals and are compact, the rectangles are disjoint, the horseshoe is the maximal invariant set of , the family is a Markov partition of for , and the boundaries of the rectangles are pieces of stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points in . Moreover, we assume that no rectangle meets the orbits of and at the same time. See Figure   above.  In this context, we have that the Markov partition provides a topological conjugacy between the dynamics of on and the subshift of finite type of whose transitions are  Next, we observe that, for each , we have a compact lenticular region (near the initial heteroclinic tangency point of ) whose boundary is the union of a piece of the unstable manifold of and a piece of the stable manifold of . Furthermore, since no rectangle meets both orbits of and , the lenticular region travels outside for iterates of before entering (for some integer ). The image of under defines another lenticular region (whose boundary is also the union of pieces of the stable manifold of and the unstable manifold of ). The lenticular regions , are called PARABOLIC TONGUES.  Let . By definition, the set introduced in is the maximal invariant set of , i.e., In other terms, the dynamics of on is localized in the region consisting of the Markov partition of the horseshoe and the parabolic tongues , , associated to the unfolding of the heteroclinic tangency.  Note that the dynamics of on is an ITERATED FUNCTION SYSTEM, i.e., it is generated by the transition maps related to the Markov partition , and the folding map between the parabolic tongues.  In this language, we see that the transition maps behave like affine hyperbolic maps: for our choices of charts, contracts almost vertical directions and expands almost horizontal directions. Of course, this hyperbolic structure is not preserved by the folding map (as it might exchange almost horizontal and almost vertical directions) and this is the main source of non-hyperbolicity of .  In particular, it is not surprising that the definition in of non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes involves the features of a certain class of affine-like iterates of .

In the context of -parameter families generically unfolding heteroclinic bifurcations, we will consider exclusively affine-like maps satisfying a certain CONE CONDITION and a certain DISTORTION ESTIMATE.  More precisely, let , , with and be the constants fixed in page 32 of : the choices of these constants depend only on the features of the initial diffeomorphism .  We say that an affine-like map with implicit representation satisfies a CONE CONDITION with parameters whenever where are the first order partial derivatives of and . Also, we say that an affine-like map with implicit representation satisfies a CONE CONDITION with parameter whenever the absolute values of the six functions are uniformly bounded by .    Given an affine-like map with implicit representation , we say that are the widths of the domain and the image of . The widths have the property that and where is a constant depending only on .  The most basic examples of affine-like maps satisfying the cone and distortion conditions with parameters are the transition maps associated to the Markov partition of the horseshoe of (cf. Subsection 3.4 of ).  For our purposes, it is important to recall that new affine-like maps can be constructed from the so-called SIMPLE and PARABOLIC compositions of two affine-like maps.  Let , , be compact intervals and let and be two affine-like maps with domains and and images and . Assume that both and satisfy the cone condition with parameters .

  <outline text="Bicritical elements and strong regularity tests" _note="In Subsection 5.6 of , the fundamental notion of -BICRITICAL ELEMENT is introduced: roughly speaking, a bicritical element corresponds to a return of the critical region of “almost tangency” to itself; in other terms, a bicritical element represents an “almost tangency of higher order”.  These bicritical elements present a potential danger to the non-uniform hyperbolicity features of . Thus, it is not so surprising that the SEVERAL QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS in for a candidate parameter interval to pass the strong regularity test involve a precise control of the SIZES and NUMBERS of bicritical elements of in many SCALES (cf. Definition 8 and the conditions , and , in ).  Among the QUALITATIVE properties satisfied by a candidate interval passing the strong regularity test we have the -REGULARITY property for some adequate choice of . Concretely, the property of -regularity for requires that all bicritical elements are thin in the sense that See Definition 2 in .  Concerning the choice of , it depends only on the features of the initial diffeomorphism : more precisely, one imposes the mild condition that where and with , denoting the unstable eigenvalues of the periodic points and , denoting the stable eigenvalues of the periodic points , and the important condition that (cf.

  <outline text="Non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes" _note="Once we know that most candidate intervals are strongly regular, let us quickly review the relationship between strong regularity and non-uniform hyperbolicity.  For this sake, we fix ONCE AND FOR ALL a strongly regular parameter , say for some decreasing sequence of candidate intervals passing the strong regularity tests, and we denote by the corresponding dynamical system.  Consider the class of certain affine-like iterates of . Given a decreasing sequence of vertical strips associated to some affine-like iterates , we say that is a STABLE CURVE.  The set of stable curves is denoted by . The union of stable curves is a lamination by (stable) curves with Lipschitz holonomy (cf. Subsection 10.5 of ).  The set of stable curves has a natural partition defined in terms of the notion of PRIME ELEMENTS of . More precisely, we say that is a prime element if it is not the simple composition of two shorter elements. Using this concept, we can write where is the set of stable curves contained in infinitely many prime elements and is the complement of .  The partition allows to partially define an induced dynamics on : given a stable curve and denoting by the thinnest prime element containing , one can show that is contained in a stable curve .  The map is Bernoulli and uniformly expanding with countably many branches (cf. Subsection 10.5 of ). Furthermore, one has a natural -parameter family of transfer operators associated to whose dominant eigenvalues detect the transverse Hausdorff dimension of the lamination : more precisely, has Hausdorff dimension where is the unique value of with (cf. Theorem 4 of ). Also, the map captures most of the dynamics on because most stable curves can be indefinitely iterated under : denoting by and , the transverse Hausdorff dimension of is (cf. Proposition 57 of ).  The properties described in the previous paragraph justify calling the WELL-BEHAVED PART of the stable set .  In a similar vein, the unstable set also has a well-behaved part consisting of all points whose orbit eventually enters the lamination consisting of unstable curves (decreasing intersections of horizontal strips associated to affine-like iterates in ).  The nomenclature NON-UNIFORMLY HYPERBOLIC HORSESHOE for is justified in by showing that the exceptional set of points outside the well-behaved part of has the following properties:  it intersects each unstable curve in a subset of Hausdorff dimension (cf. Subsection 11.5 of ), and  its -dimensional Lebesgue measure is zero (cf. Subsection 11.6 and also Theorem 7 of ).">

For our purposes of studying the quantity , it is useful to recall that the exceptional set has a natural decomposition in terms of the successive passages through the so-called PARABOLIC CORES of vertical strips (cf. Subsection 11.7 of ).  More precisely, given , the parabolic core is the set of points of belonging to but not to any CHILD of .

We begin the proof of Theorem   by showing the following lemma:    Fix and let . Then, the -Hausdorff measure at scale of satisfies for any and any admissible .  Let be admissible. By definition,  Since , i.e., , for all , it follows from Proposition 62 of that:   is a subregion of with diameter , and, a fortiori, is contained in a horizontal strip of width   is a subregion of of diameter .  On the other hand, the affine-like iterate expands the horizontal direction by a factor and contracts the vertical direction by a factor . It follows from item (b) above that is contained in a vertical strip of width .  In particular, we deduce that is contained in a rectangular region of dimensions (in the horizontal direction) and (in the vertical direction). By partitioning this rectangular region into squares of sides of lengths , we obtain a covering of by squares whose sides have length .  From the covering , we produce a covering of by analyzing INDIVIDUALLY the evolution of the elements of under the backward iterates of using the following INDUCTIVE procedure.  At the -th step, we have squares of dimensions forming a covering of Since the affine-like iterate expands the horizontal direction by a factor and contracts the vertical direction by a factor (and the folding map is fixed), we see that the inverse of sends each element of into a rectangular region of dimensions (in the horizontal direction) and (in the vertical direction). By partitioning each of these rectangular regions into squares with sides of length , we get a covering of by squares whose sides have length .  In the end of the -th step of this procedure, we obtain a covering of by squares of sides of length .  Observe that, by , one has . In particular, we can use the covering of to get the estimate  This proves the lemma.    The basic idea to prove the previous lemma is the following. We start by covering an adequate forward iterate of with little squares and we bring back this covering under the dynamics. The affine-like iterates will stretch these squares into vertical strips and, BEFORE the folding map “bend” these strips (making their geometry very intricate), we subdivide each strip into smaller squares in order to keep a QUALITATIVE control of the covering after the folding map acts.  Of course, we lose control of the FINE geometrical structure of in this argument and this is why one can not hope to apply Lemma   to get the expected Hausdorff dimension for (see also Remark   below).
