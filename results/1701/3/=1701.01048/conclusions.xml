<outline text="Conclusions" _note="This chapter provides a review of SDP methods, that perform abstract reasoning for stochastic planning, from the viewpoint of probabilistic inference. We have illustrated how the planning problem and the inference problem are related. Specifically, finite horizon optimization in MDPs is related to an inference problem with alternating maximization and expectation blocks and is therefore more complex than marginal MAP queries that have been studied in the literature. This analogy is valid both at the propositional and relational levels and it suggests a new line of challenges for inference problems in discrete domains.We have also identified the opportunity for generalized lifted inference, where the algorithm and its solution are agnostic of the domain instance and its size and are efficient regardless of this size. We have shown that under some conditions SDP algorithms provide generalized lifted inference. In more complex models, especially ones with additive rewards and exogenous events, SDP algorithms are yet to mature into an effective and widely applicable inference scheme. On the other hand, the challenges faced in such problems are exactly the ones typically seen in standard lifted inference problems. Therefore, exploring generalized lifted inference more abstractly has the potential to lead to advances in both areas.">
