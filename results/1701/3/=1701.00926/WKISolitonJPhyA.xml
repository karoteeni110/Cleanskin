    <title>-soliton formula and blowup result of the Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa equation</title>
    <abstract>We formulate the soliton solution of the Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa equation
that is determined by purely algebraic equations. Derivation is based on
the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. We give examples of one soliton
solution that include smooth soliton, bursting soliton, and loop type
soliton. In addition, we give an explicit example for two soliton
solution that blows up in a finite time. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa (WKI) equation is given by where is a complex function on . Two different types of the WKI equations are first introduced in . The first type corresponds to , which is viewed as a nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) type equation, since the linearized operator of is the Schrödinger operator. Physically it is relevant to modelling the vortex filament in the low temperature regime. Recently, a formal derivation of the WKI equation is given in that follows from the Hamiltonian equation for a vortex line originally derived in . The WKI equation, being one of exotic soliton equations, admits a bursting soliton whose maximum hight is infinity. This was first shown by Shimizu and Wadati by the Gelfand-Levitan formulation to derive soliton solution. The construction relies on existence of a Lax operator whose eigenvalue appears as a nontrivial parameter of soliton solution. The WKI equation can be written in the form where is a solution to the Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa spectral problem, given by and where and \ It is shown in that the WKI spectral problem is related to the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) type spectral problem under gauge transformations. This idea can be adapted for investigating auto-Bäcklund transformation, e.g., see .  Among other integrable equations associated with the WKI spectral problem, the Short-Pulse (SP) equation has been most extensively studied. The SP equation is related to the Sine-Gordon equation whose exact solutions are used to obtain exact solutions of the SP equation . Loop soliton and breather solutions of the SP equation have been studied in numerous literatures. Furthermore, a wave breaking result for the SP equation has been shown rigorously in . On the other hand, there has been little result on the WKI equation . From the fact that the WKI equation admits a bursting soliton, a naive question to ask is whether or not there exists a solution whose maximum hight blows up to infinity in a finite time. Existence of such blowup solution is not the case of many other integrable evolution equations. This question is interesting in problems of well-posedness and stability of soliton.  Recently, global dispersive solution to the WKI equation has been studied by one of us in , that is, if an initial data is smooth and small enough, then a corresponding solution remains smooth for all time. The matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem for the WKI spectral problem was formulated rigorously. In the present paper, we derive a fully algebraic formula of soliton solutions by summarizing a rigorous approach of the forward scattering problem and the inverse scattering problem which we relates to the framework of the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. The given formula, unarguably easier, will enable for further investigation into soliton behavior for the WKI equation. At present, we give a finite-time blowup soliton solution, i.e., the maximum hight of a smooth initial profile goes to infinity in a finite time. A blowup soliton is constructed in the case of two soliton case by MIXING a smooth soliton and a bursting soliton with suitably chosen parameters.  It is worth mentioning that the Gelfand-Levitan equation by Shimizu and Wadati could be extended to a soliton formula while an implicit equation (in our paper, it is expressed as an algebraic equation ) would remain to be non-algebraic and cumbersome to solve. Furthermore, their construction requires a potential to have a compact support. In our approach, this assumption can be significantly relaxed (see ). Additionally, we note that it is not clear how the Bäcklund transformation approach for the WKI equation leads to explicit soliton formula, while an idea of taking use of relation between the WKI system and the ANKS system is clear. Hence the Bäcklund transformation for the WKI equation requires further investigation.  It is well-known that the isotropic Heisenberg equation is related to the cubic NLS . This relation is written explicitly in equation (4.7) of . As mentioned previously, formally solution of the WKI equation is also related to the isotropic Heisenberg equation, explicitly written in equation (4.9) of by Wadati and Sogo. A simple and interesting question is, how does the WKI equation allow bursting solitons, while the isotropic Heisenberg equation and the cubic NLS are known not to have such explicit solutions? Unlike relation between the cubic NLS and the isotropic Heisenberg equation, solution of the WKI equation contains the inverse power of that of the isotropic Heisenberg equation. This latter relation is not well-defined. A singularity formation for the WKI equation appears to be quite possible.  The paper is organized as follows.  In Section  , we give the algebraic formulas that give explicit solutions to the WKI equation.  In Section  , we summarize part of to give derivation of formulas introduced in Section  . there are mainly three important steps for technical aspects, (i) transformation of the WKI spectral problem to the ANKS spectral problem for existence and analyticity of the fundamental solutions, (ii) the change of spectral parameter for suitable normalization, (iii) the change of the spatial variable in that depends on the dependent variable to eliminate the potential in the jump condition of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. This type of transformation in (iii) is called the reciprocal transformation or the hodograph transformation in many literatures, e.g., see for integrable discretizations.  In Sections  , we give three explicit examples of one soliton solutions, which are smooth soliton, bursting soliton, loop type soliton.  In Section  , we consider two soliton solution with fixed spectral parameters which correspond to a smooth soliton and a bursting soliton, if they are considered individually in Section  . We give two different examples. One is that two soliton solution consists simply of smooth soliton and bursting soliton from initial time, as expected. The other is that the maximum hight of smooth two soliton at initial time blows up to infinity in a finite time. This example is shown in Subsection  .">
