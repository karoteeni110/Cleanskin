<outline text="Introduction" _note="KIC7760680 was classified as the Slowly Pulsating B-type star by P[á]{}pics et al. who found a series of 36 frequencies quasi-equally spaced in period from the Kepler photometry. From spectroscopic observations the authors derived the effective temperature, K, surface gravity, , metallicity, (which correspond to about ) and the minimum value of the rotational velocity, kms. Based on the zero-rotation asymptotic theory, P[á]{}pics et al. attributed these frequencies to the prograde dipole gravity modes of high consecutive radial orders. Recently, Moravveji et al. made a detailed seismic modelling of the star taking into account effects of rotation in the framework of the traditional approximation applied to the non-rotating MESA evolutionary models. The authors found that KIC7760680 is a moderately rotating star with the rotational frequency amounting to 26% of its Roche break up frequency (0.4805 d) and with a mass . Furthermore, they constrained the exponentially decaying convective core overshooting parameter to . Additionally, their best seismic models employed extra diffusive mixing in the radiative envelope. Here, we repeat the Moravveji et al. approach but our computations include the effects of rotation also in equilibrium models. In Sect.2 we present results of our seismic modelling and conclusions ends the paper.">

<outline text="Seismic modelling" _note="   Knowledge of the geometry of pulsational modes is essential in seismic modelling. In the case of KIC7760680, the quasi-equally spaced in period frequency peaks suggest that these are the modes with the same degree, , azimuthal order, , and consecutive radial orders, . According to P[á]{}pics et al , the frequencies are associated with prograde dipole modes .  In order to check whether this statement is valid if the effects of rotation are included, both in the equilibrium and pulsational calculations, we constructed a grid of rotating stellar models within the error box in and . To this end we used MESA code considering a wide range of the rotational velocity, from kms to the upper limit of the validity of the traditional approximation. As the upper limit we adopted 200 kms which is about a half of the break-up velocity. The step was kms. We included various rotational mixing mechanisms, i.e., dynamical shear instability, Solberg-H[ø]{}iland instability, secular shear instability, Eddington-Sweet circulation and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability . We assumed the initial hydrogen abundance, , metallicity , the chemical mixture of Asplund et al. , and the overshooting parameter in exponential description, . Three commonly used opacity data were adopted: OP , OPAL and OPLIB .  Then, we calculated nonadiabatic pulsation models in the framework of traditional approximation (here the step in was decreased to 0.1 kms) for modes which seemed to be good candidates to reproduce observed series of frequencies, i.e., (1,+0), (1,+1), (2,+0) and (2,+1). Since for modes other than (1,+1) the best models give worse quality of the fit, (defined as in Moravveji et al. ), by the order of magnitude, we confirm that the frequencies in the series can be associated with the prograde dipole modes.  In Fig.1, the theoretical frequencies of (1,+1) modes for the best three OP models are compared with the observed ones. The parameters of these models are summarised in Table . Without a doubt, the quality of fitting needs improvement. For the best models, we obtained the values of of the order of 5500 which is the value almost three times higher than the one obtained by Moravveji et al. . This is because in our calculations we fixed metallicity and overshooting parameter compared to the cited authors. Moreover, Moravveji et al. fitted coefficient of the extra diffusive mixing in the radiatively stable envelope whereas we employed rotational induced mixing with fixed coefficients. In Fig.1 on the right Y-axis there is also shown the instability parameter ( – stable mode, – unstable mode). As one can see modes with the lowest frequencies in our best models are predicted to be stable. This is obviously contrary to the observations and needs to be improved.  The quality of the fit is quantitatively the same for each considered opacity source but for models with OPLIB opacities the theoretical instability domain is in an excellent agreement with the observed frequencies. This is shown in Fig. , in which three best OPLIB models are plotted. As one can see only 3–4 modes are marginally stable, . Parameters of these models as well as obtained with the OPAL opacities are summarised in Table .  Then, we recalculated the best OPLIB model with different values of the metallicity and overshooting parameter as well as with the modified OPLIB opacity profile. The modifications of the OPLIB data consisted of an enhancement of the opacity at the depths corresponding to temperatures , 5.46 and . The increase of the opacity at mimics the new opacity bump identified in Kurucz models by Cugier . The modified models are shown in Fig. . The increase of the opacity at by about 50% gives theoretical instability in the whole range of the observed frequencies. Moreover, for each observed frequency we found a corresponding unstable mode. Increasing opacity at helps in exciting low frequency modes whereas instability of high frequencies is unchanged. On the other hand, adding the Kurucz bump results in reducing the pulsational instability, both, at low and high frequencies. Larger value of the metallicity gives the instability domain shifted towards higher frequencies whereas more effective overshooting from the convective core acts in the opposite direction.">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="Our calculations confirmed P[á]{}pics et al. finding that 36 quasi-equidistant in period frequencies observed in KIC7760680 are most probably associated with the consecutive prograde dipole modes. However, our best models have slightly higher masses (from 3.340 to 3.525 depending on the opacity data) compared to 3.25 obtained by Moravveji et al. . The reason is that we used rotating evolutionary models which give lower effective temperature for the same mass. Rotational induced mixing can contribute to the differences as well. We got a little worse quality of the fit, , compared to the cited authors, but in our calculations we have fixed the metallicity and the parameter of the core overshooting, which Moravveji et al. set as free. It is prominent that instability domain of the (1,+1) modes obtained with the OPLIB data (see Fig. ) nearly cover the range of the observed 36 frequency peaks. A slight increase of the opacity at gives an excellent agreement. On the other hand, adding the Kurucz bump at spoils the agreement. Finally, it should be added that series of frequencies equidistant in period may be accidental as it can be reproduced by modes of various angular numbers (; see e.g. ). Therefore, it is desirable to confirm the results of mode identification using another method, e.g., using multicolour time-series photometry.">
