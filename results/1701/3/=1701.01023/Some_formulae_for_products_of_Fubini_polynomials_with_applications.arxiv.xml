Fubini polynomials are defined by They have the exponential generating function and are related to the geometric series Because of this relation Fubini polynomials are also called geometric polynomials. In addition, the following recurrence relation holds for the Fubini polynomials  The th Fubini number (ordered Bell number or geometric number) , is defined by and counts all the possible set partitions of an element set such that the order of the blocks matters. Besides with this combinatorial property, these numbers are seen in the evaluation of the following series  In the literature numerous identities concerned with these polynomials and numbers were obtained and their generalizations are given . The main purpose of this paper is to generalize the binomial formulas and the integral representation Here is the Bernoulli numbers defined by the explicit formula As applications of these generalizations we obtain explicit formulas for Apostol-Bernoulli functions and -Bernoulli numbers and integrals of products of Apostol-Bernoulli functions. We use generating function technique in the proofs.  Now we state our results.">

<outline text="Sums of products of Fubini polynomials" _note="In this section we define two variable Fubini polynomials and obtain some basic properties which give us new formulas for Moreover we shall consider the sums of products of two Fubini polynomials. The sums of products of various polynomials and numbers with or without binomial coefficients have been studied (e.g., ).  Two variable Fubini polynomials are defined by means of the following generating function For some special cases of ( ), we have  We can rewrite ( ) as Comparing the coefficients of yields  From ( ) we have Comparing the coefficients of gives Thus, setting and in ( ) we find respectively. Combining these relations with ( ) gives the equations ( ) and ( ) which were obtained by using Euler-Siedel matrix method in .  Now, we want to give the generalization of the binomial formula ( ).

For When this becomes  Now, we investigate the sums of products of the Fubini polynomials for different values in the following theorem.  For and ,  The products of ( ) can be written as Using the same method as in the proof of Theorem   we have For in the above equation gives the desired equation.  As we know, for Fubini polynomials reduce to Fubini numbers. We now point out (see ) that Fubini numbers arise for other value of , too.

<outline text="Integrals of products of Fubini polynomials" _note="The integrals of products of various polynomials and functions have been studied (e.g., ). In this section we deal with an integral for a product of two Fubini polynomials. First we need the following Lemma   and Lemma  .   For all and we have where is the Stirling numbers of the fist kind ().  We prove ( ) by induction on The case of ( ) is known from ( ). If we integrate both sides of ( ) with respect to from to and apply integration by parts, we have So using ( ) yields the case of ( ) as Multiplying both sides of ( ) with and integrating it with respect to from to we obtain Applying integration by parts and using ( ) yields the case of ( ) as If we multiply both sides of ( ) with and integrating it with respect to from to we obtain Applying integration by parts to the right hand side of the above equation and considering we have Finally, the well known relations give that the statement is true for   For any non-negative integer and ,  We rewrite this equation into matrix form by using the matrices These can be considered as infinite matrices so that the statement we are going to prove takes the form as the elementwise inverse of the matrix is . The above equation is equivalent to The matrix on the right hand side is easily decipherable. Elementwise it is The latter sum simply equals to as it is known (see ). Hence our original statement equals to the matrix equation This is nothing else but the reformulation of the fact that the second and signed first kind Stirling matrices are inverses of each other.  Now, we are ready to give the integrals of products of Fubini polynomials. Using ( ) we have Then, interchanging the sum and integral in the above equation and using ( ) yield Finally, using Lemma   gives the following theorem.   For all and we have  Using the representation ( ) in ( ) and integrating termwise one obtains This double sum identity extends ( ).  In order to give an application of Lemma  , now we emphasize the summation in the right hand of ( ). Rahmani defined -Bernoulli numbers as where denotes the Gaussian hypergeometric function .

<outline text="Applications" _note="Apostol-Bernoulli functions have the following explicit expression Thus for The functions are rational functions in the second variable, . These functions were introduced by Apostol in order to evaluate the Lerch transcendent (also Lerch zeta function) for negative integer values of and also were studied and generalized recently in a number of papers, under the name Apostol-Bernoulli numbers.  Comparing the ( ) to ( ) Apostol-Bernoulli functions can be expressed by Fubini polynomials as ()  We can use this relation to obtain some new properties of For example setting in ( ) we have which was obtained in . Similarly, from Thereom   we get the sums of products of Apostol-Bernoulli functions as given in by different method. Moreover, using the equation ( ) of Theorem   gives a new explicit formula for Apostol-Bernoulli functions.  For and  To give a different application of the relation ( ), first we deal with Lemma  . Replacing with in ( ), we have where and Similarly, from Theorem   we obtain the integrals of products of Apostol-Bernoulli functions as given in the following corollary.
