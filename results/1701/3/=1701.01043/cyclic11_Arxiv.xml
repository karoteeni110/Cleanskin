<outline text="Introduction" _note="For a finite field , a CYCLIC CODE of length is a linear subspace that is closed under cyclic permutations, i.e., for every codeword , all cyclic permutations of are also included in . Cyclic codes have been extensively studied over the last decades exhibiting a rich algebraic structure with immense applications in storage and communication, e.g., .  A code over alphabet is said to have (NORMALIZED) MINIMUM DISTANCE at least if any two distinct codewords in are of Hamming distance at least . It is also said to have RATE . Of particular interest are GOOD FAMILIES OF CODES, which are sequences of codes , with of length , rate , and minimum normalized distance , such that simultaneously,  One of the most fundamental challenges in coding theory is to construct good families of codes. Several such families were presented in the literature over the years. This includes, for example, the Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) codes and the algebraic constructions of Justesen and Goppa (see also ). However, the existence of a good family of CYCLIC (linear) codes is a long-standing open problem, see e.g., .  In an attempt to shed some light on the problem of good cyclic codes, some works considered close variants to cyclic codes. Quasi-cyclic and double-circulant codes are one example, created by interleaving cyclic codes. These families were shown to contain families of good codes . Another such example is the family of module skew codes, which are almost cyclic except for a slight twist in the permutation. These were recently shown to contain a good family of codes .  In this work, we study another variant of cyclic codes – NON-LINEAR cyclic codes[^1]. For simplicity of presentation we consider only the binary case. We will show that this family of codes contains a good family which asymptotically meets the GV bound , i.e., of normalized distance and asymptotic rate approaching , where stands for the binary entropy function. This matches the best known lower bound for binary codes of minimum normalized distance that are not necessarily cyclic. To the best of our knowledge, good families of non-linear binary cyclic codes have not been previously presented in the literature.  Our construction of good binary non-linear cyclic codes is conceptually very simple and includes two steps. In the first step we construct a high-rate binary code which we call AUTO-CYCLIC. (All formal definitions are given below in Section  .) An auto-cyclic code is a non-linear cyclic code in which the set of cyclic permutations of any given codeword is of (normalized) minimum distance at least . In this context, we refer to as the AUTO-CYCLIC distance. Auto-cyclic codes are reminiscent of ORTHOGONAL or low AUTO-CORRELATION codes, e.g. . Using a probabilistic argument, we show the existence of a subset of of asymptotic rate which is auto-cyclic with auto-cyclic distance arbitrarily close to . Once a high-rate auto-cyclic code is established, we greedily remove some of its elements (using a slight variant of the well known greedy process that leads to the GV bound) to obtain the desired non-linear cyclic code of rate and minimum distance .  The remainder of this note is structured as follows. In Section   we present our formal definitions. In Section   we prove the existence of binary non-linear cyclic codes that meet the GV bound. Section   includes concluding remarks and open questions.  [^1]: It is common in the literature to define cyclic codes as linear.     Thus, we shall make it a point to emphasize the fact that the codes     we consider MAY BE non-linear by naming them NON-LINEAR CYCLIC     CODES.">

<outline text="Non-linear Cyclic Codes" _note="We start with the following lemma that provides a probabilistic construction of binary auto-cyclic codes of high rate.    For every and every sufficiently large prime , there exists an binary auto-cyclic code of rate at least . In particular, there exists a sequence of binary auto-cyclic codes of normalized minimum distance and asymptotic rate .  Let be a sufficiently large prime. Consider choosing a random element in from the uniform distribution. Namely, each entry of is chosen i.i.d. uniformly over . We study the probability that . Let . We first analyze the probability In our analysis we will use the fact that for a prime , the sequence consists of elements that are all distinct modulo . For , let be the indicator of the event that the -th coordinate (modulo ) of differs from that of , namely that differs from . As is prime it holds that  Let be an arbitrary vector, and consider the probability Notice that each event depends only on and . Using the fact that the sequence consists of elements that are all distinct modulo , we conclude that for : Here, we used the fact that each entry of is uniform over and that is independent of the entries that determine the events . Thus,  We now conclude that for any , Above, we upper bound the Hamming ball of radius by , where stands for the binary entropy function. By the union bound over , we have  Finally, define By we have for and a sufficiently large , so the rate of is at least . In addition, if then any cyclic shift of is also in .  Equipped with Lemma  , we are ready to prove our main result stated below.  For every and there exists a sequence of binary non-linear cyclic codes of normalized minimum distance at least and asymptotic rate at least .  Fix and let . We construct for every sufficiently large prime an binary non-linear cyclic code of rate at least . Our construction has two steps. In the first step, using Lemma  , we construct an auto-cyclic code of rate at least .  In the second step we construct by a greedy procedure similar to that used in the standard GV bound. Specifically, we start with . Let be any word in . Add and all its cyclic shifts to and remove them from . In addition, remove from all words for which . In this process, since , we remove at most words from . Here, as before, we upper bound the Hamming ball of radius by . Note that for any removed, we also remove all its cyclic shifts.  We now continue in iterations, in each iteration we add an element and all its cyclic shifts to and remove all for which from (including and its cyclic shifts). We continue in this fashion until is empty.  It follows that the code constructed above has size at least and thus has rate at least The code is an binary non-linear cyclic code. Namely, by construction, for each and it holds that . Moreover, by the iterative procedure, any distinct satisfy .">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this work we proved the existence of a good family of binary non-linear cyclic codes of normalized distance and asymptotic rate (i.e., codes that meet the GV bound). The codes we construct are non-linear. Specifically, for , the code obtained in the first step of our construction is the collection of all codewords with auto-cyclic distance greater or equal to . This code is not linear. To see this, consider any for which for all it holds that . The proof of Lemma   shows the existence of several such . Consider now the codeword . The codeword satisfies the slightly weaker condition that for all . So both and have auto-cyclic distance at least however has auto-cyclic distance of . The second step of our construction, which removes elements from to obtain the cyclic code of distance and rate arbitrarily close to , is greedy and does not necessarily yield linear codes. Whether the first step of our construction can be refined using algebraic techniques to yield a linear auto-cyclic code, or whether the second step of our construction (assuming a linear ) can yield a linear code , are intriguing problems left open in this work. Problems that, if solved, may shed light on the existence of good binary linear cyclic codes.">
