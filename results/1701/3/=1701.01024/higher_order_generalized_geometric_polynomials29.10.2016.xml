    <abstract>According to generalized Mellin derivative , we introduce a new family
of polynomials called higher order generalized geometric polynomials. We
obtain some properties of them.We discuss their connections to
degenerate Bernoulli and Euler polynomials. Furthermore, we find new
formulas for the Carlitz’s and Howard’s finite sums. Finally, we
evaluate several series in closed forms, one of which has the

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The operator , called Mellin derivative , has a long mathematical history. As far back as 1740, Euler used the operator as a tool work in his work . The Mellin derivative and its generalizations are used to obtain a new class of polynomials , to evaluate some power series in closed forms and to calculate some integrals . One of the generalizations of Mellin derivative is where is any -times differentiable function and are generalized Stirling number pair with three free parameters (see Section 2). Stirling numbers and their generalizations have many interesting combinatorial interpretations. Besides, these numbers are connected with some well known special polynomials and numbers . For example, the following interesting formulas for Bernoulli numbers and Euler polynomials appear in : For all ;  From all these motivations, by using the generalized of Mellin derivative in ( ), we introduce a new family of polynomials , called higher order generalized geometric polynomials, evaluate some power series in closed forms and calculate some integrals. After that, in view of the properties of higher order generalized geometric polynomials, we derive new explicit formulas for degenerate Bernoulli polynomials, Bernoulli polynomials and degenerate Euler polynomials. As a consequences of these formulas we evaluate Carlitz’s and Howard’s sums.  The summary by sections is as follows: Section 2 is the preliminary section where we give definitions and known results needed. In Section 3, we define higher order generalized geometric polynomials and obtain some properties such as recurrence relation and generating function of Moreover, we derive new explicit formulas for degenerate Bernoulli polynomials, Bernoulli polynomials and degenerate Euler polynomials. By the help of these formulas we find new formulas for Carlit’s and Howard’s sums. In final section, we obtain some integral representation of . Besides, we evaluate several power series in closed forms. For example, in the special cases, the following series, where the coefficients include values of the Riemann zeta function, is evaluated in closed form (for any integer )  Throughout this paper we assume that and are real or complex numbers.">

<outline text="Preliminaries" _note="The generalized Stirling numbers of the first kind and of the second kind for non-negative integer and real or complex parameters and with are defined by means of the generating function with the convention when  As Hsu and Shiue pointed out, the definitions or generating functions generalize various Stirling-type numbers studied previously, such as:  are the Stirling numbers of both kinds .  are the Howard degenerate weighted Stirling numbers of both kinds .  are the Carlitz’s degenerate Stirling numbers of both kinds .  are the -Stirling numbers of both kinds .  are the Whitney numbers of the first and second kind .  are the -Whitney numbers of the first and second kind ,  and so on.  According to the generalization of Stirling numbers, Hsu and Shiue defined generalized exponential polynomials as follows Later, Kargin and Corcino gave an equivalent definition for as and using the series in ( ), they obtained the general Dobinksi-type formula Here, is called the generalized factorial of with increment , defined by for and In particular, we have  Some other properties of can be found in .  The generalized geometric polynomials are defined by means of the generalized Mellin derivative as These polynomials have the explicit formula and the generating function See for details.  The higher order degenerate Euler polynomials are defined by means of the generating function  From ( ), we have where are the higher order Euler polynomials which are defined by the generating function  In special cases, where and are the degenerate Euler and Euler polynomials, respectively.  The degenerate Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind are defined by means of the generating function  Indeed, we get where are the Bernoulli polynomials which are defined by the generating function with are -the Bernoulli numbers.
