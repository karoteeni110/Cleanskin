<outline text="The model and simulation procedure" _note="To accurately simulate the interfacial phenomena, we have applied the classical MD method for the case of two canonical ensembles - and . The choice of ensembles in MD simulations of finite-size systems has already been shown to play an important role in coexisting phases . MD Simulations provide detailed information on the molecular structure of the interface when the intermolecular potential is available .\ The model system is a thick toluene film located perpendicularly to the -axis of the simulation box. The size of the box ensures that no artifacts will appear when periodic boundary conditions are implemented to diminish finite-size effects. The box contains also water molecules and and ions at a concentration of . The force field parameters of the ions and included in the model are taken from [GROMOS96]{} . Parameters for toluene molecules are derived from benzyl side chain of phenylalanine molecule. Three-site (simple point charge) water model is used .  Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the model system are performed with the help of the [GROMACS]{} package, designed to simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles . The simulations are performed in canonical and ensembles which keep the total number of atoms constant; the temperature is . In the ensemble the constant volume equals to the size of the simulation box, . In the case of the ensemble the system is equilibrated at the constant pressure of . After the equilibration, the simulation is performed at a constant surface tension between toluene and water . In preliminary MD runs the simulation time of was determined to be sufficient for thermodynamic equilibration of the total energy, pressure, and temperature of the model system.\ An external electric field is applied in the direction of the simulation box. In the ensemble the electric field strength is changed from to in steps of , while in the ensemble the strength is changed from to in steps of .">
