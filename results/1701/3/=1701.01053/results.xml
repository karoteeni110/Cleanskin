  <outline text="simulation - build-up of interfacial charge" _note="The interaction between the toluene film and the surrounding water molecules and ions results in a dynamic charge distribution. The Figure   illustrates the ion (sodium and chlorine) charge density distribution in the -direction. The distribution is computed within the last of the run (total run time ). The three curves correspond to , and strengths of the external electric field. At (red curve), which calibrates the results, the charge fluctuates around zero at the film interfaces. A non-zero external field induces charge accumulation at film interfaces. The accumulated charge is drawn as peaks in the charge distribution. The curves for (green) and (blue) electric field strengths show that the accumulated charge increases with the field increase: one interface of the toluene film is charged positively due to accumulation, while the other interface is charged negatively due to ion accumulation. Thus, the emulsion film, subjugated to the external electric field, resembles charging of a parallel-plate capacitor. At all applied fields the ion charge fluctuates around zero away from the film.  Averaging over time was performed over the last 2.5 of the production run. An external electric field with strengths up to does not rupture the toluene film for the duration of the simulation - . It should be noted that the charge distribution obtained at the field within time intervals less than shown in the Figure   feature on average the same patterns as the distribution computed field shown with a blue line in the Figure  .\ Electric discharge is initiated after the pore formation as it is seen in the Figure  . After , the accumulated interfacial charge is drained - no peaks in the charge distribution of the ruptured film.  [.45]{}  [.45]{}  [.45]{}  [.45]{}  [.45]{}  [.45]{}  [.45]{}  [.45]{}">

  <outline text="simulation - film rupture mechanism" _note="When the electric field is set to a pore is formed in the film after . It is observed that the pore expands along the simulation box over time. The time evolution of the pore formation is shown in Figure   for the time between and . The pore is seen as a light spot in Figure   at . When the pore is wide enough water molecules fill in the pore area, seen as a bluish background in the Figure   at . By observing the pore evolution in the toluene film, the time of the complete film rupture (formation of toluene drop) can be determined.  [.32]{}  [.32]{}  [.32]{}  .    Inspection of the thickness profile at reveals existence of a dimple inside the toluene film (Figure  ) prior to the film rupture.The role of the non-homogeneity has been widely reported in thin liquid film literature since 1941 .  Our simulations demonstrate that a non-homogeneous film ruptures at its thinnest place because the electric field strength is the highest there. In other words, the biconcave region of the film interface is subjected to a higherthanaverage electrostatic pressure and therefore is a preferred site for the film rupture and nanopore formation.\ ">

  <outline text="simulation - the film structure" _note="The charge density of free ions, water, and toluene molecules in the -direction can be observed in the Figure  . The figure illustrates the structure of the toluene film surrounded by aqueous electrolyte solution at , , and electric field strengths. For the latter case the density was averaged over the first of simulation, i.e. before the startup of the rupturing process. The part of the film that contains only toluene molecules is called toluene [CORE]{}, [BULK]{} water phase is that part of the film, where the density of water molecules is maximal.  The core thickness was estimated using a doublesigmoid function (Equation  ) at of the plateau height , where , being the left and the right half-height respectively, is the steepness of the sigmoid:  At no applied field, Figure   there exists a pure toluene core of thickness, which is surrounded by two interfacial layers formed by mixing toluene and water interfacial layers. In the toluene interfacial layer, the concentration of toluene molecules decreases in the direction from the pure toluene core towards the bulk water phases, eventually reaching zero concentration. Respectively, in the aqueous interfacial layer, the concentration of water molecules decreases towards the toluene core. Toluenewater mixed layer is thick, which is estimated as the distance where the toluene density in -direction drops from to from the plateau height . The bulk aqueous phases contain and ions. The density profiles show that ions penetrate the mixed interfacial layers that border the toluene core. Thicknesses of the film core and the interfacial layer are shown in the Table  .  The Figure   shows that application of field leads to build-up of accumulated positive charges on one side of the toluene film and negative charges on the other side. The peaks of accumulated charges are situated at the boundary between bulk water and interfacial aqueous layer. In the direction towards toluene core, the concentration of ions decreases and reaches zero at the toluene core. Ions penetrate only the mixed interfacial region, which is due to the formation of hydration shells. The Figure   reveals that field increase up to is followed by accumulation of more charges, bringing enough attractive force that leads to thinning of the pure toluene core by down to , while the thickness of the interfacial layers of toluene and water increases by . A possible hypothesis is that the increased electrical compression reshapes the film topography making it a high amplitude rugged surface and the interfacial layer becomes thicker. The Figure   depicts the film structure (profile) at and data are averaged over the time interval of . This is the moment () just before the rupturing process takes place.

  <outline text="simulation - the film structure" _note="In this section, the results from canonical ensemble simulation are presented. The charge buildup is plotted in the Figure  . The Figure   depicts the charge build-up at , , and . As in the NVT case, at zero external field no peak formation is observed on both sides of ionic line that exhibits zero-charge density. At such formation already takes place and becomes much pronounced at and (Figure  ). Film rupture occurs at a much lower electric field strength () compared to the NVT simulation (). Film rupture occurs at a much lower electric field strength () compared to the NVT simulation (). The information regarding the thickness of the toluene core, boundary layers and the total film are summarized in Table  . The thickness of different layers were again determined by using the doublesigmoid formula in Equation  . At no applied field, the toluene core has the same thickness as in the NVT case. However, the difference between the two simulations is revealed in the size of the mixed boundary zone, being larger for the NPT ensemble. Increase of the electric field, as in the NVT case, again leads to the thinning of the toluene core and to the expansion of the boundary layers. However, at (NPT) there is a bit higher thinning of the core, compared to (NVT), despite of the lower applied field. This observation, together with the obtained lower critical field could suggest enhanced development of instability in the NPT simulation. It should be noted that in both simulations at the critical field the core has the same thickness instants before the film rupture. Moreover, at that critical field the thickness of the boundary layers and of the total layer are almost identical in both and ensembles.  [.32]{}  [.32]{}  [.32]{}  .  ">
