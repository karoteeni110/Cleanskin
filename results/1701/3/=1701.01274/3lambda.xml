    <title>Around Average Behavior: 3-lambda Network Model</title>
    <abstract>The analysis of networks affects the research of many real phenomena.
The complex network structure can be viewed as a network’s state at the
time of the analysis or as a result of the process through which the
network arises. Research activities focus on both and, thanks to them,
we know not only many measurable properties of networks but also the
essence of some phenomena that occur during the evolution of networks.
One typical research area is the analysis of co-authorship networks and
their evolution. In our paper, the analysis of one real-world
co-authorship network and inspiration from existing models form the
basis of the hypothesis from which we derive new 3-lambda network model.
This hypothesis works with the assumption that regular behavior of nodes
revolves around an average. However, some anomalies may occur. The
3-lambda model is stochastic and uses the three parameters associated
with the average behavior of the nodes. The growth of the network based
on this model assumes that one step of the growth is an interaction in
which both new and existing nodes are participating. In the paper we
present the results of the analysis of a co-authorship network and
formulate a hypothesis and a model based on this hypothesis. Later in
the paper, we examine the outputs from the network generator based on
the 3-lambda model and show that generated networks have characteristics
known from the environment of real-world networks. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Network analysis is a phenomenon that affects research in many areas. One of the goals of network analysis is to describe the phenomena, properties, and principles that are universal and manifest in nature, society, and in the use of technology. As a network, we understand an ordered pair (undirected unweighted graph) of a set of nodes and a set of edges which are unordered pairs of nodes from . The complex network structure can be viewed from the perspective of the network’s state at the time of the analysis. Networks can, therefore, be described by the properties known from the environment of real-world networks, including, in particular, the small-world, free-scale, high average clustering coefficient, assortativity , community structure, shrinking diameter , but also others such as core-periphery structure and self-similarity . Underlying processes that take place during the evolution of real-world networks are also examined. Some models are based on analyzing these processes, which allows using the formally described underlying process as a generative mechanism. Such a mechanism can generate networks possessing one or more known properties. Models that reveal key principles include those using the preferential attachment to generate network centers or triadic closure i.e. completing interconnections into triangles, capable of generating community structure .  Models that provide key knowledge about networks are usually inherently simple. Most of them, however, focus on the question “HOW TO CONNECT A NEW NODE INTO THE NETWORK?” Our question is, “HOW DOES AN EXISTING NODE BEHAVE TO ITS NEIGHBORS AND OTHER EXISTING AND NEW NODES DURING THE NETWORK’S EVOLUTION?”. The result of our focus on the behavior of EXISTING NODES is a simple model WITHOUT MEMORY and with only THREE PARAMETERS. This new 3-lambda model is inspired by the evolution of the co-authorship network. For the analysis we used a network generated from a DBLP dataset and we worked with the assumption that in each publication is just one key author who picks out additional co-authors. In the analytically oriented experiment, we show that with such an assumption, the number of publications with a given number of co-authors corresponds approximately to a Poisson distribution. Based on the result of this experiment, we formulate a simple hypothesis and the resulting network growth model. This hypothesis assumes that one-step of the network growth is an interaction involving existing and new network nodes. In this respect our approach is similar to the model of collaborative networks published by Ramasco et al. and inspired by the analysis of co-authorship ego networks in research of Arnaboldi et al. . 3-lambda is a stochastic model that estimates the number of nodes in the interaction using the Poisson distribution. In the experimental part of this paper, we describe the network generator based on our model and three experiments. The first experiment shows that generated networks have characteristics known from real-world networks, and how the selected properties change with a different setting of the generator. The second experiment shows how the properties of generated network change during its growth. The aim of the third experiment is to compare some characteristics of the DBLP network and large-scale generated networks.  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section   focuses on the related work. Section   provides our findings and hypothesis on the real-world network extracted from the DBLP dataset. In Section  , we describe the 3-lambda model of collaborative network and network generator based on this model. Section   focuses on three experiments with generated networks. We conclude and briefly discuss open problems in Section  .">

<outline text="Related work" _note="In the last two decades, the analysis of real-world networks has received extraordinary attention. One of the sources of data is social networks, which are growing at an enormous rate. Notable and a long investigated source in this area are co-authorship and, in general, collaborative networks. A common feature of this type of network is that underlying processes proceed in cliques, which then become a fundamental building block of the network. Barabasi et al. presented and analyzed in detail a network model inspired by the evolution of co-authorship networks. The research presented by Ramasco et al. falls into the same area; it analyzed in detail the development of collaboration networks. Their model combines preferential edge attachment with the bipartite structure and depends on the act of collaboration. The rise of the giant connected component in the set of -cliques of a classical random graph was described by Derenyi at al. as well as a -clique community, as a union of all -cliques. A novel model of multi-layer network was proposed by Battiston et al. , their model captures a multi-faceted character of actors in collaborative networks.  The universally recognized principle is the so-called preferential attachment. At the moment of the connecting of new nodes to the network during its growth, there is a preference for selecting high degree nodes. The well-known Barabasi-Albert model is based on experimental work and analysis of large-scale data. Zuev et al. described how preferential attachment together with latent network geometry explains the emergence of soft community structure in networks and non-uniform distribution of nodes.  One of the basic characteristics of some types of networks (social and biological), is their community structure. Understanding the principles upon which communities emerge is a key task. Growing network model using the triadic closure mechanism is able to display a nontrivial community structure, as was proposed by Bianconi at al. . The addition of links between existing nodes having a common neighbor as a local process leads to the emergence of preferential attachment as is stated by Shekatkar &amp; Ambika . In another model for growing network proposed by Toivonen et al. , communities arise from a mixture of random attachment and implicit preferential attachment.  A frequent feature of these approaches is that communities rise from a combination of links between existing nodes with their neighbors to new nodes. Some of these approaches do not use the preferential attachment for node selection because the scale-free property is the result of underlying processes.  Another well-known property of real-world networks is that communities have overlaps. A node may belong to more cliques simultaneously, and this property is the basis of the Clique Percolation Method presented by Palla et al. . The clique graph, wherein cliques of a given order are represented as nodes in a weighted graph, is a conceptual tool to understand the -clique percolation described by Evans . Yang and Leskovec introduced the Community-Affiliation Graph based on observation, that community overlaps are denser than communities themselves.  Processes in the networks take place in time. Networks are from this perspective temporal, and each interaction is reflected in changes to the network structure. Application of the principles mentioned above in the course of network evolution allows us to examine how network structure changes over time. Holme &amp; Saramaki presented a time-varying importance of nodes and edges together with a survey of existing approaches and the unification of terminology in the area of temporal networks research. Ramasco at al. studied social collaboration networks as dynamic networks growing in time by the continuous addition of new acts of collaboration and new actors. In real-world networks, particularly social ones, instances often have strong relations defined as interactions that are frequently repeated (nodes remember them), as well as weak relations representing the occasional interactions. Karsai et al. explain, how is creating new relationships and strengthening existing links in networks important for network evolution.  There are also novel approaches focused on models which allow generating networks with predictable properties. For instance, Zhang et al. formulated a generative model as an optimization problem.  In our approach, we do not use preferential attachment in a straightforward manner. It is, however, a side effect of principles related to the nature of the formation of the community structure. In our model, we use a clique as a structural element of the network. A clique is the result of interaction among nodes and is the basis of the community structure. Our networks are generated as temporal because one interaction is the result of one step of the growth of the network.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="Evolution of real-world networks is influenced by many factors. The purpose of network models is to discover these factors and describe them in a simple way. Our research focused on analyzing behavioral patterns of nodes existing in a co-authorship network while participating in publishing activities. We described four roles of nodes involved in interactions. Based on the analysis of the DBLP dataset, we formulated the hypothesis, which assumes that the numbers of nodes involved in interactions revolve around an average, and they are independent Poisson variables. Based on this hypothesis, we defined the 3-lambda model of collaborative network. The model has three parameters and has no memory. In three experiments, based on three different settings corresponding to dyads, triads and larger groups behavior, we showed that networks generated by the 3-lambda model have the characteristics known from the environment of real-world social networks. Furthermore, we showed that the model can be understood as temporal. In one experiment we presented the development and stabilization of generated network properties in time. For future research there remain some open questions. They bear relation to recognizing other factors influencing the development of the network and to the detailed study of the dependence and predictability of properties of generated networks on the setting of three network parameters (lambdas).">
