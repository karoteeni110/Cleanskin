<outline text="Finiteness properties and first Betti numbers" _note="We will now show how the results of Section   can be used to prove that under the assumption of strong enough finiteness properties the projections in Theorem   have a finite index subgroup with even first Betti number.    Let and let be a homomorphism that is induced by a holomorphic map with full image of type for . Then is virtually coabelian of even rank and there is a finite index subgroup with even first Betti number.  It follows from Proposition   that is virtually coabelian of even rank. Let be finite index subgroups, and be an epimorphism such that is a finite index subgroup.  By Lemma  , the group is a finite index subgroup for all . Since , there is a partition of into three disjoint subsets , and such that . Thus, is a finite index subgroup.  Define . Consider the finite index subgroup and define finite index subgrups . Consider the restriction of to the finite index subgroup .  Since , we have . Thus, the projection of onto the is surjective and we can therefore apply Proposition  . Hence, the induced homomorphism is injective and However, is even, because is a finite index subgroup of the Kähler group for . Thus, we obtain for the finite index subgroup .  With the notation of Theorem  , assume that the group has finiteness type . Then the projections onto factors with indices have a finite index subgroup with even first Betti number.  If, moreover, and , then is even.  The first part is an immediate consequence of Proposition   and the fact that the homomorphism in Theorem   is virtually induced by a holomorphic map.  For the second part, observe that after possibly passing to the finite index subgroup , we may assume that is a direct product with full subdirect. Since , has a finite index subgroup with even first Betti number. The group is Kähler, so it also has even first Betti number. Therefore, is even.">
