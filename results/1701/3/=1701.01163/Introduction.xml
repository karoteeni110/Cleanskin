<outline text="Introduction" _note="A KÄHLER GROUP is a group that can be realised as the fundamental group of a closed Kähler manifold. The question of which finitely presented groups are Kähler was first raised by Serre in the 1950s and has driven a field of very active research since. While numerous strong constraints have been proved and examples of Kähler groups with a variety of different properties have been constructed, the question remains wide open. For a general background on Kähler groups see , for a more recent overview see .  While a general answer seems out of reach for the moment, it is fruitful to consider Serre’s question in the context of more specific classes of groups. For instance, it has been shown that if the fundamental group of a compact 3-manifold without boundary is Kähler then it is finite (see also and ) and that a Kähler group with non-trivial first L2-Betti number is commensurable to a SURFACE GROUP (i.e. the fundamental group of a closed Riemann surface) . Delzant and Py showed that if a Kähler group acts geometrically on a locally finite CAT(0) cube complex, then it is commensurable to a direct product of finitely many surface groups and a free abelian group .  More generally, a close connection between Kähler groups acting on CAT(0) cube complexes and subgroups of direct products of surface groups has been observed starting with the work of Delzant and Gromov on cuts in Kähler groups (see also ). This led Delzant and Gromov to pose the question of which Kähler groups are subgroups of direct products of surface groups? Following the work of Bridson, Howie, Miller and Short , one knows that this question is intimately related to the question of finding Kähler groups which are not of FINITENESS TYPE for some , i.e. do not admit a classifying space with finite -skeleton: any subgroup of a direct product of surface groups which is is virtually a direct product of surface groups and finitely generated free groups.  The first examples of Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups which are of type but not () were constructed by Dimca, Papadima and Suciu . Their class of examples has since been extended by Biswas, Mj and Pancholi and by the author . All of these examples arise as kernels of surjective homomorphisms of the form where and is a closed Riemann surface of genus , . Recently, examples of Kähler groups that are of type but not of type , and which are not commensurable to any subgroup of a direct product of surface groups have been constructed by Bridson and the author .  This paper consists of three parts. In the first part (Section 2) we develop a new construction method for Kähler groups. The groups obtained from this method arise as fundamental groups of fibres of holomorphic maps onto higher-dimensional complex tori. In the second and third part we address Delzant and Gromov’s question. In the second part (Sections 3 – 5) we apply our construction method to provide Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups that are not commensurable with any of the previous examples. These arise as kernels of a surjective homomorphism onto and are IRREDUCIBLE, i.e. do not decompose as direct product of two nontrivial groups (even virtually). The examples constructed in this work significantly extend the range of irreducible full subdirect Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups: all previous examples of such Kähler subgroups of a product of surface groups are either virtually a product of surface groups and a free abelian group, or of type , but not of type . Here we produce irreducible examples of type and not of type for all , hence covering the full range of possible finiteness properties . In the third part (Sections 6 – 9) we give new constraints of Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups. In particular, we show that if a full subdirect product of surface group is Kähler of type with then it is virtually the kernel of an epimorphism from the product of surface groups onto a free abelian group of even rank.  One says that a surjective holomorphic map between compact complex manifolds has ISOLATED SINGULARITIES if the critical locus of intersects each fibre (preimage of a point) in a discrete subset. The key result in our construction method is Theorem  , a special case of which is:  Let be a compact complex manifold of dimension and let be a complex torus of dimension . Let be a surjective holomorphic map with connected smooth generic fibre . Assume that there is a filtration of by complex subtori of dimension such that the projections have isolated singularities, where is the holomorphic quotient homomorphism.  If , then the map induces a short exact sequence Furthermore, we obtain that for .    Theorem   and Theorem   are generalisations of and . We expect that our methods can be applied to construct interesting new classes of Kähler groups. Indeed we provide a first application in this work, by constructing new classes of Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups.  Throughout this article will denote a closed hyperbolic surface of genus and its fundamental group.  Let and be integers and let be an elliptic curve (i.e. a complex torus of dimension one). For let be a branched cover of , with and assume that is surjective on fundamental groups for . Then there is a surjective holomorphic map with smooth generic fibre such that the restriction of to each factor factors through . The map induces a short exact sequence and the group is Kähler of type but not of type . Furthermore, is irreducible.    Here we use the notation for the cartesian product of copies of . The coabelian subgroups of direct products of surface groups form an important subclass of the class of all subgroups of direct products of surface groups. Indeed, in the case of three factors any finitely presented full subdirect subgroup of is virtually COABELIAN, i.e. contains the derived subgroup of some of finite index; with more factors any full subdirect subgroup is virtually conilpotent . We will give a more detailed discussion of subgroups of direct products of surface groups in Section  .  We will see that the examples we construct to prove Theorem   are in some sense the generic class of examples with the property that the image of each factor in is an elliptic curve. As a consequence of Theorem   and its proof we obtain that there are indeed Kähler groups covering the full range of possible finiteness properties of irreducible full subdirect products of surface groups.  For every , and , there is a Kähler subgroup which is an irreducible full subdirect product of type but not of type .    We will see that a modification of the construction used to prove Theorem   provides a second class of examples (see Theorem  ). As a consequence we see that Theorem   can also be proved by considering only holomorphic maps to a product of two elliptic curves. The reduction in dimension of the complex torus will come at the cost of loosing the genericity of the examples in Theorem  .  Conversely, we address the question of finding constraints on Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups, or more generally on Kähler groups that admit homomorphisms to direct products of surface groups.    Let with compact Kähler and let be a surjective homomorphisms onto a subgroup . Assume that has finitely generated kernel and that is full and of type for .  Then, after reordering factors, there is such that, for any and any , the projection is virtually coabelian of even rank. Furthermore, the center is a finite index subgroup.  Combining Theorem   with a study of the first Betti number of coabelian subdirect products of groups in Section  , allows us to show that there are non-Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups with interesting properties.    Let for an epimorphism. Then is not Kähler.  For and there is a non-Kähler full subdirect product with even first Betti number.  ">

In Sections   and   we construct large new classes of Kähler subgroups of direct products of surface groups, which we use to prove Thereoms   and  . In Section   we show that these examples are irreducible, i.e. are not virtually direct products, and derive there precise finiteness properties. In Section   we study homomorphisms from Kähler groups to direct products of surface groups and show Theorem   and Corollary  . In Section   we study the first Betti number of coabelian subgroups of direct products of groups and prove Corollary  . We apply the results of Section   to obtain additional constraints on homomorphisms from Kähler groups to direct products of surface groups. In Section   we consider the universal homomorphism from a Kähler group to a direct product of Riemann orbisurfaces and we explain why our constraints apply to it.
