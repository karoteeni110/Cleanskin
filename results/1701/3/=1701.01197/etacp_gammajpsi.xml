the transition</title>
    <abstract>Using 106 million events collected with the BESIII detector, we measure
multipole amplitudes for the decay beyond the dominant electric-dipole
amplitudes. The normalized magnetic-quadrupole amplitude for and the
normalized electric-octupole amplitudes for ,  are determined. The M2
amplitudes for and are found to differ significantly from zero and are
consistent with theoretical predictions. We also obtain the ratios of M2
contributions of and decays to , and , which agree well with theoretical
expectations. By considering the multipole contributions of , we measure
the product branching fractions for the cascade decays and search for
the process through . The product branching fraction for is 3 larger
than published measurements, while those of are consistent. No
significant signal for the decay is observed, and the upper limit of the
product branching fraction at the 90% confidence level is determined. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The processes and are dominated by electric-dipole (E1) amplitudes but allow for higher multipole amplitudes as well, such as the magnetic-quadrupole (M2) and electric-octupole (E3) transitions. The contributions of these higher multipole amplitudes give information on the anomalous magnetic moment of the charm quark  and on the admixture of - and -wave states . The normalized M2 contributions for and , which are referred to as and with the superscript representing , are predicted to be related to the mass of the charm quark, , and  . By assuming and ignoring the mixing of - and -wave states, the contributions and , corrected to first order in , where is the energy of in the rest frame of the mother charmonium state, are predicted  to be respectively. The ratio of the M2 contributions of to ( to ) is independent of the and of the charm quark to first order in and predicted to be and , respectively , where the dominant uncertainties come from ignoring contributions of higher-order in . Higher order multipole amplitudes can be obtained by investigating the angular distributions of the final-state particles . Several experiments have searched for higher-order multipole amplitudes . The CLEO experiment reported significant M2 contributions in and by analyzing 24 million decays . Recently, BESIII found evidence for the M2 contribution in with  .  The experimentally observed charmonium states and their decay can be reproduced reasonably well by calculations based on a potential model and by perturbative quantum chromodynamics . However, for the E1 radiative transitions of , there are significant discrepancies between different model predictions  and the Particle Data Group (PDG) average . The partial widths of are predicted to be 26, 29, and 24 keV, respectively, by using the Godfrey-Isgur model , which deviate by , , and from the averages of experimental measurements .  In this paper, we report on a measurement of the higher-order multipole amplitudes in the processes of , where the is reconstructed in its decay modes . The measurements make use of the joint distributions of the five helicity angles in the final-state. Using the invariant mass of , we obtain the product branching fractions of and search for produced through . In the measurement of the product branching fractions of , the multipole contributions of are considered for the first time. The results presented in this manuscript supersede the ones in Ref. . The analyses are based on a sample of 156  taken at a center-of-mass energy 3.686 GeV, corresponding to 106 million  . A   data sample taken at 3.773 GeV  and a 44 pb data sample taken at 3.65 GeV are used to estimate the backgrounds from QCD processes.">

<outline text="BESIII detector and Monte Carlo simulation" _note="The BESIII detector is described in detail in Ref. . It is an approximately cylindrically symmetric detector which covers 93% of the solid angle around the collision point. The detector consists of four main components: (a) a 43-layer main drift chamber provides a momentum resolution of 0.5% for charged tracks at 1 GeV/ in a 1 T magnetic field; (b) a time-of-flight system (TOF) is constructed of plastic scintillators with a time resolution of 80 ps (110 ps) in the barrel (end caps); (c) a 6240 cell CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) provides an energy resolution for photons of 3.0% (5.0%) around 0.3 GeV in the barrel (end caps) ; (d) a muon counter consisting of nine (eight) layers of resistive plate chambers in the barrel (end caps) within the return yoke of the magnet with a position resolution of 2 cm provides muon/pion separation. A [geant4]{}  based detector simulation package has been developed to model the detector response used in Monte Carlo (MC) generated events.  A MC simulated sample of 106 million generic decays (“inclusive MC”) is used for general background studies. The resonances are produced by the event generator [Kkmc]{} . The known decays are generated by [BesEvtGen]{}  with branching fractions taken from the PDG , while the remaining decays are generated according to the [Lundcharm]{} model . Exclusive MC samples for signal decays are generated to optimize the selection criteria and to determine the detection efficiencies. The decays are generated with angular distributions determined from data, and the decay is generated according to the [Helamp]{} model in [EvtGen]{} . To estimate the background contributions from decays, the exclusive MC samples are generated according to the [Helamp]{}, [Jpipi]{} , and [Phsp]{} models, respectively. To investigate QED processes backgrounds, radiative Bhabha and dimuon events () simulated with [Babayaga V3.5]{} , as well as and produced by [Kkmc]{} , are used together with the experimental data at 3.773 GeV.">

<outline text="Event selection" _note="The signal decay consists of two charged tracks and two photons. Events with exactly two oppositely charged tracks and from two up to four photon candidates are selected. Charged tracks are required to originate from the run-dependent interaction point within in the direction perpendicular to and within along the beam axis and should lie within the polar angular region of . The momentum of each track must be larger than 1 GeV/. The energy deposit in the EMC and of each track are used to identify muon or electron candidates. Tracks with GeV are taken as muons, and those with are identified as electrons. Events with both tracks identified as muons or electrons are accepted for further analysis. Photons are reconstructed from isolated showers in the EMC, where the angle between the positions in the EMC of the photon and the closest charged track is required to be larger than deg. The energy deposited in the EMC is corrected by the energy loss in nearby TOF counters to improve the reconstruction efficiency and the energy resolution. The energy of each photon shower is required to be larger than 25 MeV. The shower timing information is required to be in coincidence with the event start time with a requirement of  ns to suppress electronic noise and showers unrelated to the event.  A four-constraint (4C) kinematic fit is performed for the two lepton candidates and all possible two photon combinations with the initial 4-momentum as a constraint. If more than one combination is found in one event, the one with the smallest value is kept. The is required to be , where the requirement is determined by optimizing the statistical significance for the channel. Here, is the number of events in the signal region GeV/ ( denotes the photon with larger energy, and is the invariant mass with the energies and momenta updated with the 4C kinematic fit) obtained from the exclusive MC sample, and is the number of corresponding background events determined from the 106 million inclusive MC sample and a continuum data sample collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.65 GeV. The latter is normalized to the luminosity of the data sample. The branching fraction of the decay is assumed to be 1%.  To select events including the intermediate state, the invariant mass of the lepton pair is required to be in the region of GeV/. In addition, to remove and backgrounds, events with an invariant mass of the photon pair in the regions  GeV/ or  GeV/ are rejected. A MC study shows that this removes 97.9% of the events and almost 100% of the events, while the efficiencies of the signal channels for , and are 74.7%, 90.0%, 93.9%, and 88.0%, respectively.">

An unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the joint angular distribution for data is performed, and the corresponding angular distributions are depicted in Fig.   together with the relative residual spectra. The fit results are listed in Table  , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematical as described in Sec.  .  The statistical significance of a nonpure E1 transition is calculated to be 24.5 (13.5) for () by taking the difference of the log-likelihood values for the fits with higher-order multipole amplitudes included and fits based on a pure E1 transition, taking the change in the number of degrees of freedom, , into consideration. Similarly, the statistical significance of the E3 contribution for is 2.3, as obtained by comparing the log-likelihood values between the nominal fit and a fit based on the assumption that E3 contribution is zero.

<outline text="" _note="With the selected candidates, we measure the product branching fractions of the decay and search for the process . For the channel, additional requirements are applied to suppress the background from radiative Bhabha events  . Since the electron (positron) from radiative Bhabha tends to have a polar angle close to +1 (-1), we apply a requirement of and . These requirements suppress 77% of the Bhabha events with a reduction of the signal efficiency by one-third. The corresponding MC-determined efficiencies are listed in Table  .  A 4C kinematic fit has the defect that the energy of a fake and soft photon will be modified according to the topology of a signal event due to relatively large uncertainty, which results in a peaking background signature in the invariant-mass spectrum. To remove the peaking background, such as radiative Bhabha and radiative dimuon (), a three-constraint (3C) kinematic fit is applied, in which the energy of the soft photon () is left free in the fit. The detailed MC studies indicate that the 3C kinematic fit does not change the peak position of the invariant mass for signals and the corresponding resolutions are similar to those with the 4C kinematic fit.">

The second major source of background includes radiative Bhabha and dimuon processes, and . To precisely describe the shape, the background is divided up into two parts: with one radiative photon and with two radiative photons. For the background from , the ratio of event yields between the two parts () is obtained by a MC simulation. For the background from radiative Bhabha/dimuon processes, the ratio is obtained by a fit to a 928 pb data sample taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV. After the event selection imposed on the data, the remaining events are mainly radiative Bhabha/dimuon events, and a small contribution originates from and decays of produced in the ISR process. In the fit, the shapes of the distributions for the Bhabha/dimuon processes are determined from a MC sample by shifting the from to according to the formula , where GeV/ is the mass threshold of , and the coefficient shifts the events from 3.686 to 3.773 GeV.

<outline text="Systematic uncertainties" _note="The main sources of systematic uncertainty for the measurements of higher-order multipole amplitudes are the uncertainties in the efficiency, the kinematic fit procedure, the fit procedure of the combined angular distributions, statistical fluctuations of the MC sample, and the background contamination.  A simulated sample of events distributed uniformly in [PHSP]{} is used to normalize the function . A difference of detection efficiencies between the MC sample and the data will result in a shift in the measurement, which is taken as the systematic uncertainty. From the studies of the tracking efficiency for electrons and muons with the control samples of decays, and the photon efficiency with the control samples from decays and radiative dimuon events, the difference in the detection efficiencies between the data and MC is found to be polar angle dependent with the largest value , which may change the helicity angular distribution. The corresponding effect on the higher-order multipole measurement is estimated by varying the efficiency with an asymmetric function of and as  . Twice the difference with respect to the nominal result is taken as a systematic uncertainty. For the kinematic fit, the track helix parameters are corrected to reduce the difference in the distribution between the data and the MC simulation according to the procedure described in Refs. . These [PHSP]{} MC samples without and with the helix correction are used to normalize , respectively, and the resultant difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty.  To estimate the uncertainty from the fit procedure, 200 MC samples using the high-order multipole amplitudes are generated, followed by a complete detector simulation. Each sample has 165 thousand (90 thousand) selected events for , and the same multipole analysis procedure is applied for each sample. The differences in () between the input and fitted values are Gaussian distributed. The mean values of the Gaussians are , () and are taken as the systematic uncertainty. The statistics of the MC sample for the normalization, about 3.6 (1.8) million events, may affect the fit results. For the normalization function, Eq.( ), the variance for is     The standard deviation for each coefficient is . The largest change in parameters and by varying the coefficient by for the channel (, and for the channel) is taken as the systematic uncertainty.  The main backgrounds for the channel come from , which contribute about 0.7% of the candidates according to a MC study. For the channel, the main backgrounds come from , and the contribution is about 1%. In the nominal fit, the contribution of background is estimated by the inclusive MC samples. To estimate the systematic uncertainty, high-statistics MC samples for backgrounds are generated to redetermine the shape and the contribution according to previous measurements . The difference in the fit results is taken as the systematic uncertainty. All the systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table  . The total systematic uncertainties are calculated by adding the individual values in quadrature, thereby assuming that they are independent.  The systematic uncertainties of the branching fractions measurement include uncertainties from the number of events (0.9%) , the tracking efficiency (0.1% per lepton) , the photon detection efficiency (1.0% per photon) , the kinematic fit, the mass window, the other selection criteria (, veto and , particle identification, ), the branching fraction of (0.6%) , the interference between and nonresonant processes, and the fitting procedure.  The uncertainty from the kinematic fit is estimated by the same procedure as described in the multipole amplitude measurements. To estimate the uncertainty caused by the mass requirement, a control sample in the region GeV/ is used. For data, the only background is from , which is determined in fitting with the exclusive MC shape. The efficiency of selection (3.08,3.12) GeV is evaluated by comparing the number of signal events before and after the requirement, and the corresponding difference between the data and MC sample is 0.6% for the channel and 0.1% for the channel. To be conservative, we take 0.6% as the systematic uncertainty. With the same sample, the systematic uncertainties related to the selection criteria , veto, veto, and leptons identification are also determined. The overall difference in the efficiency between the data and MC sample for these criteria is 1.6% and is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The additional systematic uncertainty due to the polar angle selection for the channel is determined by varying the selection with and fitting simultaneously again. The largest changes on the fit results are taken as the systematic uncertainty.  To estimate the possible uncertainty from the interference between and , we repeat the simultaneous fit, taking the interference into account. The interference phase is found to be . The changes in the signal yields are taken as the systematic uncertainty. Since the signal shapes are determined from MC simulation, the corresponding systematic uncertainty is estimated by an alternative fit with varying the mass and width of with of the world average values  for the signal MC shape. To estimate the uncertainty due to the background of and the ratio of for Bhabha and dimuon backgrounds, alternative fits are performed in which the numbers of expected background events (see Table  ) and the ratio of are varied by . For , the largest differences in the signal yields from the nominal values are taken as the systematic uncertainty. For the case, to be conservative, the one corresponding to the largest upper limit is taken as the final result. All systematic uncertainties of the different sources are summarized in Table  . The total systematic uncertainties are obtained by adding the individual ones in quadrature, thereby assuming all these sources are independent.">

By using the most precise measurement of the M2 amplitudes and by taking  GeV/, the anomalous magnetic moment can be obtained from Eq. ( ), where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second uncertainty is systematic, and the third uncertainty is from  GeV.  Based on the multipole analysis, we measure the product branching fractions for to be , , and , respectively, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. In Fig.  , the product branching fractions are compared to previous results from BESIII , CLEO , and the world average . The world average refers to the product of the average branching fraction of and the average branching fraction of , where the results of BESIII and CLEO are not included in the world average values. For all , our results exceed the precision of the previous measurements. Compared to the previous BESIII result, the results are consistent within 1, but we have considered the higher-order multipole amplitudes and improved the systematic uncertainty due to a more precise measurement of the total number of produced  . In addition, our measurement for the channel is 3 larger than the result from CLEO and 3 larger than the world average value, while for the , our results are consistent with previous measurements. There are theoretical predictions for the branching fraction by several different models  without consideration of higher-order multipole amplitudes, which agree with each other poorly. The results in this measurement will provide a guidance for the theoretical calculations.  \  We also search for the decay through . No statistically significant signal is observed. Considering the systematic uncertainty, an upper limit on the product branching fraction is determined to be at the 90% C.L., where the systematic uncertainty is incorporated by a factor for conservative. Combining the result of obtained by BESIII , the upper limit of the branching fraction for is at the 90% C.L. Using the width of of  MeV/ , our upper limit implies a partial width of 0.50 MeV/. Although this result agrees with the prediction of LQCD (0.0013 MeV/) , it clearly has a very limited sensitivity to rigorously test the theory.
