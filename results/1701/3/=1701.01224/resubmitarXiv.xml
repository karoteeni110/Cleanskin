    <title>Swimmer-microrheology</title>
    <abstract>We discuss a locomotion of a three-sphere microswimmer in a viscoelastic
medium and propose a new type of active microrheology. We derive a
relation which connects average swimming velocity and
frequency-dependent viscosity of the surrounding medium. In this
relation, the viscous contribution can exist only when the time-reversal
symmetry is broken, whereas the elastic contribution is present only
when the structural symmetry of the swimmer is broken. The Purcellâ€™s
scallop theorem breaks down for a three-sphere swimmer in a viscoelastic
medium. </abstract>
