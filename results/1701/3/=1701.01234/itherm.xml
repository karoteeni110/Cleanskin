    <title>Failure of deterministic and stochastic thermostats to control
temperature of molecular systems</title>
    <abstract>We investigate the ergodicity and “hot solvent/cold solute" problems in
molecular dynamics simulations. While the kinetic moments and the
stimulated Nosé–Hoover methods improve the ergodicity of a
harmonic-oscillator system, both methods exhibit the “hot solvent/cold
solute" problem in a binary liquid system. These results show that the
devices to improve the ergodicity do not resolve the “hot solvent/cold
solute" problem. </abstract>
