<outline text="Introduction" _note="Metal-poor galaxies are less chemically evolved galaxies and provide ideal laboratory for investigating galaxy properties in extreme condition . Among them, extremely metal-poor galaxies (hereafter XMPGs), defined by their low oxygen abundance with , are the most promising young galaxy candidates in the local universe . These XMPGs are suspected to be primeval galaxies that are undergoing their first major mass assembly at the observed redshift . Studying these extreme objects can improve our understanding about the early stages of galaxy assembly.  The determination for abundance of elements are considered more reliable if the electron temperature can be measured directly, because the metallicity is anti-correlated with the electron temperature. The electron temperature can be obtained using the auroral line ratios, such as . This technique is often called the method . However, galaxies with metallicities derived from the method with detections above 3 are extremely rare. To date, only about 174 such objects has been found .  In order to enlarge the sample of metal-poor galaxies with 4363 detection, we carry out a systematic search for such objects in the LAMOST Data Release (DR3, DR4 Q1 and Q2). In Section  , we present our approach for detecting and measuring nebular emission lines, and the selection criteria used to identify the metal-poor galaxies. We describe the determination for the dust attenuation properties and the gas-phase oxygen abundances in Section  . In Section  , we describe the methods for estimating stellar masses and SFRs, and then compare the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-SFR relation with local -based relation in Section  . In addition, we discuss our results in the context of other studies in Section  . Finally, we summarize our main conclusions in Section  .  Throughout this paper, we adopt a flat cosmology with , , and km s Mpc to determine distance-dependent measurements. For reference, we adopt for metallicity measurements quoted against the solar value, .">

It is equipped with 4000 fibers, covering a wavelength range of 3800 9000 at a resolving power R 1800. The LAMOST Data Release 3 (DR3), Data Release 4 (DR4) Q1 and Q2, based on the past survey from October 2011 to February 2016, contain about three million spectra with limiting magnitude of 18.5 mag. The LAMOST 1D pipeline classifies spectroscopic targets as galaxies, stars, and QSOs by matching against observed SDSS spectral templates, see for detail. 92,510 objects from the LAMOST catalog are spectroscopically classified as galaxies (‘OBJTYPE’ = ‘GALAXY’).">

The wavelength calibration of each spectrum is accomplished by using arc lamp spectra lines, with an average calibration error less than 0.02. The accuracy of the relative flux calibration of LAMOST is above 90.  Assuming unimodal gaussian line profile, we obtain fluxes of strong emission lines such as , , , , and by fitting their line profile using the IDL package &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;mpfit&lt;/span&gt; . The expected location of emission lines are based on a priori redshift determined by the line.

  <outline text="Sample selection" _note="Among all the galaxies from the LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Surveys (LEGAS), we first select a subsample of metal-poor galaxies with emission line flux ratios , which consists of 665 galaxies. Among them, we identify 237 objects with detection at . We inspect these 237 objects visually, and find 73 of them are false detections. We also exclude 115 objects that are regions in nearby large galaxies using optical images with SDSS DR12 skyserver [^1]. Finally, we check the right ascension and declination of the remaining sources, and note that 1 object was observed twice by LAMOST. We keep the observation that has better spectral quality.  As a consequence, our final sample consists of 48 galaxies, making up only of all the LAMOST galaxies until DR4 Q2; this fraction is nearly the same as SDSS . The median S/N of is 6.1. We obtain the equivalent width (EW) by dividing the flux by continuum spectral flux intensity, which is assumed as the average value of observed flux intensities within 50 wide component around the line. All of the galaxy spectra in our sample show strong emission lines with a median (average) EW of of 42.9 (53.5) . The EW distribution of is shown in Figure  .  To exclude possible AGN contamination, we use the BPT diagram . Figure   shows the distribution of our sample in the BPT diagram. The grayscale 2D histogram shows the number density of LAMOST galaxies. The blue dots represent 48 galaxies in our final sample, and the black crosses represent 24 galaxies in our final sample that have also been spectrally detected by SDSS. Among these 24 galaxies detected with SDSS, 19 galaxy spectra also have the detections above 3; we will compare these 19 galaxy spectra from LAMOST and SDSS in Section  . The solid and dashed lines are the demarcation curves between SFGs and AGNs derived by and . Galaxies located between the two lines are usually classified as composite objects, which may host a mixture of star formation and AGN. It can be seen that all of the galaxies in our final sample are located in the star-forming region; however, this is unsurprising since we initially selected sources with .  Figure   shows example spectra for eight galaxies in our sample that have both been spectrally detected by LAMOST and SDSS. For each object, the left panel shows the LAMOST spectrum, while the right panel shows the SDSS spectrum. All of these spectra show strong emission lines such as (for all LAMOST spectra and part of SDSS spectra), , , and . The inserted panels show the zoomed spectra adjacent to lines. It can be seen that the weak lines are all detected in the spectra of these galaxies.  [^1]: http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/tools/chart/listinfo.aspx">

Generally, the underlying stellar absorption in the Balmer lines should be well determined to obtain a reliable emission line measurement . In this work, we first subtract the underlying stellar continuum and stellar absorption for each spectrum using the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;starlight&lt;/span&gt; spectral synthesis code . We assume the intrinsic flux ratio of under Case B recombination and use the reddening formalism to derive the color excesses , and then correct the emission line fluxes. In addition, we manually set the color excesses to zero when the ratios are less than 2.86.  The resulting reddening-corrected emission line fluxes relative to and color excesses are listed in Table 1.

  <outline text="Metallicity calculation" _note="With significant detection of , we can determine the metallicity using the so-called method. In this work, we use the python package &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;pyneb&lt;/span&gt; [^1] to calculate the electron densities () and electron temperatures (), which is evolved from the IRAF nebular package . have demonstrated that the electron temperatures would be overestimated, and thus the oxygen abundances would be underestimated when using older collision strength data and approximate temperature calibration methods from . Therefore, we need to set the atomic recombination data and atomic collision strength data before the calculation. We adopt the atomic recombination data of for , , and for . For collision strength data, we adopt those from for , for , and for .  As encouraged in , we use a cross-converging method to calculate the electron temperatures of regions () and electron densities () with ratios of and . Once the electron temperatures and densities are determined, we can obtain the ionic oxygen abundances using the ratios with the relation derived from . In order to derive the electron temperatures of regions, we follow an iterative method used in , where is the total oxygen abundance, . The temperature and abundance will converge within five iterations, starting by using the abundance as the total oxygen abundance. Here, the abundance is determined from and the ratio using the relation. Using other methods from or , we will get a higher about 0.02 dex and a lower metallicity about 0.05 dex given a . Similarly, we will get a higher about 0.03 dex and thus get a lower metallicity about 0.05 dex when adopt the standard two-zone temperature model from and . In our final sample, 31 galaxies also have the detections above 3. Using the ratios to derive , we will get lower and higher metallicities, the differences between these average values on and metallicities are about 360 and 0.06 dex, respectively.  To estimate the uncertainties of electron temperatures, electron densities and oxygen abundances, we repeat the calculation 2000 times. For every object, we produce a series of fluxes for each emission line with a Gaussian distribution, assuming its average is the measured line flux and standard deviation is the measured error. Then, our final temperature, density and oxygen abundance are deemed to be the median values of these 2000 calculations, and the corresponding errors are estimated as the half of range of their distributions. We list the final electron temperatures, electron densities and oxygen abundances of our sample in Table 1.  Figure   shows the distributions of color excesses, electron densities, electron temperatures and oxygen abundances. The electron densities and temperatures in our sample range from to and , with median values of and , respectively. Their oxygen abundances range from 7.63 to 8.46, with a median of 8.16. The only XMPG found in our sample is ID26 with , which has already been found by with . Interestingly, galaxy ID33, also named as RC2 A1228+12, was regarded as an XMPG in and , but the metallicity indicates it is not an XMPG. This judgement was also supported by and with metallicity measurements of and , respectively.  [^1]: http://www.iac.es/protecto/PyNeb/">

  <outline text="Stellar masses" _note="To determine the galactic stellar masses of our sample galaxies, we use the IDL code library &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/span&gt; developed by to perform the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/span&gt; compares the photometry measurements with stellar population synthesis models, based on the minimum template-fitting procedure, to determine mass-to-light ratios, which can be used to estimate the stellar masses of galaxies. We use the stellar templates of and a initial mass function (IMF) to synthesize magnitudes. These models span four metallicities (0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.05 ) and an exponentially decreasing star formation models (SFR ) with a step from . We assume the dust attenuation law from allowing to vary from 0.0 to 2.0 and stellar population ages ranging from 0 to 100 Gyr. To determine the uncertainties of stellar masses, we use the Monte Carlo simulations and define the number of simulations as 1000. We choose the confidence interval as 68.  Photometric measurements are collected from various survey catalogue. We adopt values of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;modelmag&lt;/span&gt; magnitudes of , and bands from SDSS DR12 photometry catalogue , magnitudes of , and bands from 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog (PSC) and 2MASS All-Sky Extended Source Catalog (XSC) , magnitudes of (3.4 ) and (4.6 ) from All WISE Source Catalog , and magnitudes of FUV and NUV from GR6/7 Data Release Catalog . However, not all of our sample galaxies have these photometric measurements. For example, 45 galaxies have FUV photometry, while 3 galaxies are not located in surveyed areas. For these three galaxies, we just use their magnitudes from band to band to perform the SED fitting. We find our sample galaxies spanning three orders with . We should note that we do not make the point spread function (PSF) matching for our photometric data using same observation aperture, which may lead to some uncertainties in stellar mass measurements. The average and median values on stellar mass measurement uncertainties are 0.14 dex and 0.12 dex, respectively. However, comparing our results with total stellar masses in MPA-JHU catalog for these galaxies included in MPA-JHU catalog, we find the differences of average and median values are about 0.1 dex and 0.03 dex, respectively.

  <outline text="MZR and FMR" _note="The MZR relation, which was established originally by and developed by , , , , , indicates that the metallicities of galaxies correlate with their stellar masses. Taking SFR into consideration, found that metallicity decreases with increasing SFR at low stellar mass, while does not depend on SFR at high stellar mass (). However, suggested that high-mass () galaxies have lower metallicities when their SFRs are lower. These different results may be caused by different metallicity calculation methods. In addition, the MZR is also affected by other physical parameters, such as stellar age and gas fraction. found that the metallicity is strongly dependent on the , which interpreted galaxies with older stellar ages as having higher metallicities at a fixed stellar mass. found that galaxies with higher gas fraction have lower metallicities at a fixed mass. and argued that the MZR is in fact a projection of FMR. In the past years, many efforts (e.g., ) have been made to explore the MZR and FMR feasibility from low mass to high mass, as well as the evolution with redshift. In the local universe, the metallicity increases with increasing stellar mass, and decreases with increasing SFR at a fixed stellar mass when . found that the metallicity is anti-corrected with specific SFR regardless of different metallicity indicators or methods used when , while the dependence is weak or absent for massive galaxies when . also demonstrated that the relative specific SFR is a more physically motivated second parameter for the MZR, and found that the overall scatter in the FMR relation does not significantly decrease relative to the dispersion in the MZR. Recently, reported that the FMR is between stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass instead of the SFR. In addition, measured the metallicity of star-forming galaxies based on and calibrations, and found that whether the FMR exists or not depend on the metallicity measurement method. The dependence on metallicity and SFR at high stellar mass is still in argument . For the intermediate redshift universe, showed clearly that the MZR evolves toward lower metallicity at fixed stellar mass with increasing redshift , and found a much weaker dependence of MZR on SFR than in the local universe.  In panel of Figure  , we colour-code our galaxy points with their SFRs. Figure   shows that most of galaxies in our sample have higher metallicities than that of galaxies in , but are consistent with the result in . The difference between our work and may be caused by difference in sample selection and calibrations for electron temperatures and . found that the scatter in MZR for the M-SFR stacks with -based metallicity is 0.22 dex, while the scatter in the FMR is 0.13 dex. The decrease of scatter value in reflects a strong SFR-dependence on the MZR. From visual examination, we do not find strong dependence of MZR on SFR. However, the scatter in FMR is 0.24 dex, lower than the 0.28 dex scatter in MZR, suggesting MZR is weakly dependent on SFR. We note that the average and median values of metallicity measurement uncertainties are 0.09 dex and 0.08 dex, respectively. The average and median values on stellar mass measurement uncertainties are about 0.14 dex and 0.12 dex, respectively. The larger scatters in MZR and FMR compared with relations may be caused by the small galaxy sample size, as well as the measurement uncertainties on stellar mass.">
