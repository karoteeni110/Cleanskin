    <title>A Generalization of Quasi-twisted Codes:\
Multi-twisted codes</title>
    <abstract>Cyclic codes and their various generalizations, such as quasi-twisted
(QT) codes, have a special place in algebraic coding theory. Among other
things, many of the best-known or optimal codes have been obtained from
these classes. In this work we introduce a new generalization of QT
codes that we call multi-twisted (MT) codes and study some of their
basic properties. Presenting several methods of constructing codes in
this class and obtaining bounds on the minimum distances, we show that
there exist codes with good parameters in this class that cannot be
obtained as QT or constacyclic codes. This suggests that considering
this larger class in computer searches is promising for constructing
codes with better parameters than currently best-known linear codes.
Working with this new class of codes motivated us to consider a problem
about binomials over finite fields and to discover a result that is
interesting in its own right. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction and Motivation" _note="Every linear code over a finite field has three basic parameters: the length (), the dimension (), and the minimum distance () that determine the quality of the code. One of the most important and challenging problems of coding theory is a discrete optimization problem: determine the optimal values of these parameters and construct codes whose parameters attain the optimal values. This optimization problem is very difficult. In general, it is only solved for the cases where either or is small. There is a database of best known linear codes with upper bounds on minimum distances that is available online . The database is updated as new codes are discovered and reported by researchers.  Computers are often used in searching for codes with best parameters but there is an inherent difficulty: computing the minimum distance of a linear code is computationally intractable (NP-hard) . Since it is not possible to conduct exhaustive searches for linear codes if the dimension is large, researchers often focus on promising subclasses of linear codes with rich mathematical structures. A promising and fruitful approach has been to focus on the class of quasi-twisted (QT) codes which includes cyclic, constacyclic, and quasi-cyclic (QC) codes as special cases. This class of codes is known to contain many codes with good parameters. In the last few decades, a large number of record-breaking QC and QT codes have been constructed (e.g. -). The search algorithm introduced in has been highly effective and used in several subsequent works (-).  In this work, we introduce a new generalization of QT codes that we call multi-twisted (MT) codes. It turns out that this class also generalizes more recently introduced classes of double cyclic codes (), QCT codes (), and GQC codes (). After deriving some of their algebraic properties and obtaining a lower bound on the minimum distance, we show that from this class we can obtain linear codes with best-known or optimal parameters that cannot be obtained from the smaller classes of constacyclic or QT codes.  Before introducing this new class of codes, we recall some fundamental results about constacyclic and QT codes that will be needed later.">

<outline text="Constacyclic and Quasi-twisted Codes" _note="Constacyclic codes are very well-known in algebraic coding theory. Let . A linear code over a finite field is called constacyclic with shift constant if it is closed under the constacyclic shift, i.e. for any , . When , we obtain the very important special case of cyclic codes. Many well-known codes are instances of cyclic codes.  Under the usual isomorphism , where , for , it is well-known that a constacyclic code is an ideal in the ring . Moreover, for every constacyclic code there is a unique, monic polynomial of least degree in that generates , i.e. . This standard generator is a divisor of , so that , for some which is called the check polynomial of . Note that the set of all codewords can be described as , i.e. the set is a basis for where .  A constacyclic code has many other generators as well and we have a complete characterization of them as follows.   Let be a constacyclic code of length and shift constant with canonical generator and check polynomial so that . Then if and only if is of the form with .  A linear code is said to be -quasi-twisted (-QT) if, for a positive integer , it is invariant under , that is, whenever , then as well. It is important to note that when we obtain constacyclic codes. We therefore assume that , the case corresponding to constacyclic codes.  It is well known that algebraically a QT code of length with shift constant is an -submodule of where . If has a single generator of the form then it is called a 1-generator QT code, otherwise a multi-generator QT code. Most of the literature on QT codes focuses on the 1-generator case. We will do the same in this work.  A certain type of 1-generator QT codes, sometimes called degenerate QT codes, is particularly useful and promising when searching for new linear codes. This is due to the lower bound on the minimum distance given in the following theorem.     Let be a -generator -QT code of length with a generator of the form: where , such that and is relatively prime to for each . Then is an -code where , , and denotes the minimum distance of the constacyclic code of length generated by .  A proof of this theorem is given in . In reality, the actual minimum distance of is often considerably larger than the lower bound given by the theorem. Researchers designed algorithms and conducted computer searches based on this theorem and discovered many new linear codes (-).">

<outline text="Multi-twisted Codes" _note="We propose an even more general class of linear codes, which we call MULTI-TWISTED (MT) codes. A MULTI-TWISTED MODULE is an -module of the form where and are (possibly distinct) positive integers. An MT code is an -submodule of a multi-twisted module . Equivalently, we can define an MT code in terms of the shift of a codeword. Namely, a linear code is multi-twisted if for any codeword its multi-twisted shift  is also a codeword. If we identify a vector with where , then the MT shift corresponds to .  Note that cyclic, constacyclic, QC, and QT codes are all (permutation equivalent to) special cases of MT codes. For example, QT codes are obtained as a special case when and . Moreover, more recently introduced classes of codes called generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes , QCT codes , and double cyclic codes can be viewed as special cases of MT codes.  An MT code is a one-generator code if it is generated by a single element of . This work will focus primarily on one-generator MT codes.  Our next goal about MT codes is to find a lower bound on the minimum distance of a 1-generator MT code similar to the one in Theorem  . This leads to considering the greatest common divisor of two binomials and . Working on this question, we discovered a result about the greatest common divisor of two binomials and over which we believe is a new result about polynomials over finite fields, and interesting in its own right. We state and prove this result in the next section.">

<outline text="A Result About Binomials over Finite Fields" _note="Considering generators of MT codes brings up the problem of determining the greatest common divisor of two binomials of the form and . We found that the of two such polynomials is either 1, or another binomial of the same form. The precise statement and a proof are as follows.    Let , Then for , [gcd]{} is either 1 or of the form , for some . In particular, [gcd]{} .  We will let denote the multiplicative order of , i.e. it is the smallest positive integer such that . For a non-zero element , denotes the order of in the multiplicative group of . Let and for some and non-zero elements with and . Let and . It is known that and split into linear factors in the extensions and , respectively. In order to find a common extension of these two fields, consider . We claim that , that is, and . Indeed, since , we have, in particular, . Since , it follows that . Similarly we obtain .  Let be a primitive th root of unity. Then and are primitive th and th roots of unity, respectively.  If and do not have a common root, then gcd, and we are done. Suppose now that there exists a common root of and , that is, is an th root of and th root of . It follows that the roots of are and the roots of are  The set of roots of is the intersection of the two sets above. Note that these sets are actually cosets of the multiplicative subgroups\  and of , respectively. It follows that the set of roots of is a coset of the intersection of these subgroups. Therefore, is a generator (primitive element) of the subgroup of the intersection where . Hence, the roots of are Therefore, . Finally, we show that to prove that is of the desired form , hence completing the proof. Write and for some relatively prime integers . Since , there exist integers such that . We know that and , which implies  Over , , and .  This theorem has some implications for constacyclic codes. Suppose and are such that for some non-zero and . Any constacyclic code of length with shift constant has a generator that divides , hence and . Therefore, we observe that the polynomial can also be regarded as the (standard) generator of a constacyclic code of length with shift constant as well as the generator of a constacyclic code of length with shift constant .">

Clearly, as well. If with parameters and with parameters , then we observe that has parameters . We formally prove this in the next theorem.    Let be such that . Let and with . Let and with parameters and , respectively. Then the MT code with generator has parameters , where , , and .  The assertions on length of the MT code is clear. To prove the assertion on dimension, we show that the set , where , is a basis for . Suppose that , Then and . Therefore, and . Since and are relatively prime (because ), we have , and hence . This implies the linear independence of vectors in .  It remains to show that is a set of generators for . For this it suffices to show that for every with there exists with such that So let be an arbitrary polynomial with . We can write as , for some where . It follows that Finally, to show that , let be a codeword of minimum weight in . Since , we have . Hence, for some (degree of which can be taken to be ). Letting and considering the codeword , we find a codeword of weight in . We can similarly show that there exists a codeword of weight in as well.  Given this result, we cannot hope to find codes with good parameters under the conditions of the above proposition. We need to look for alternative ways to construct MT codes with potentially high minimum distances. Before coming to more promising constructions, let us first disqualify another case where no MT codes with high minimum distances can be expected.    Let , be such that , for some and let and with , . Let be the MT code of length with generator , where and . Then has parameters with .  An argument identical to the one used in Proposition   shows that is a basis for , and hence proves the assertion about the dimension.  In order to see that minimum distance is at most 2, we first assume, w.l.o.g., that and observe that is also generated by . Then we note that , which is a codeword of weight .  Note that the theorem above points out a significant difference between QT and MT codes, since many good codes from the class of QT codes have generators of the form , where . Hence, we need to consider MT codes with generators of different form to look for codes with potentially high minimum distances. The next theorem presents such a subclass of MT codes. Afterwards we will introduce a class of promising subcodes of MT codes.    Let , be such that , for some and let and with , . Let be a constacyclic code with shift constant and parameters and let be a constacyclic code with shift constant and parameters . Then an MT code with a generator of the form , where for , has parameters , where .  The assertion on dimension can be proven as in the previous theorems. To see why , let , for some , be an arbitrary codeword in . We observe that the first component of is 0 if and only if if and only if the second component of is 0. Therefore, in there are no codewords with only 1 non-zero component, and hence .  We now give an example of an MT code with parameters of a best-known code, obtained using the theorem above. It shows that the actual minimum distance of an MT code can be significantly larger than the theoretical lower bound.  Let and in Theorem  . We have where . The constacyclic codes and generated by and as described in Theorem   have parameters and respectively. Then the MT code with a generator in the form given by the theorem has parameters with . We found that for and , the minimum weight is actually 36. Hence we obtain a ternary code which is a best known code for its parameters .  Another way to obtain codes with larger minimum distances is to consider subcodes of MT codes.    Let be a constacyclic code with shift constant and parameters and let be a constacyclic code with shift constant and parameters . Let and with . Then an MT code with a generator of the form , where for , has a subcode with parameters , where and .  We consider the subcode of of dimension , generated by  ,  where . We have that every codeword of is of the form where is a polynomial of degree . To prove , it suffices to show that for a non-zero polynomial both components of the codeword are non-zero. But this is true since and , and therefore does not divide . Similarly, does not divide .  Note that a straightforward generalization of the argument above proves the following  Let be a constacyclic code with shift constant and parameters for . Let with . Then an MT code with a generator of the form where for , has a subcode with parameters , where and .  Finally, we highlight a special case of Theorem   which may be useful.    Let , and , where . Let and be any two polynomials such that and . Let be the MT subcode generated by . Then has parameters , where , and , where is the minimum weight of the constacyclic code of length , shift constant , and generated by .">

<outline text="Examples" _note="Finally, we present a few examples of subcodes of MT codes with good parameters. All of these codes have parameters of a best-known code, and some of them are optimal. Moreover, some of them cannot be obtained as a constacyclic or QT code. Considering the class of MT codes and their subcodes in a computer search to discover new linear codes is both more promising and more challenging than in the QT case because the search space is larger.  Let , , , and . We have . By letting , , and in Corollary  , we obtain a code with parameters . According to the database , this is the parameters of a best-known code.  Let , , , and . We have . In this case, the gcd is greater than but we can still take as the generator of a constacyclic code so that is the trivial code . Let . Then and it generates a constacyclic code with parameters .

By Theorem   we know that an MT subcode generated by , where will have paramaters with . We have found that for the resulting code has parameters , which is the parameters of a best known code . We would like to point out that since is a prime number, it is not possible to obtain a code of length 53 and dimension 18 from the class of QT codes with index greater than 1. Moreover, from the factorization of the polynomial , for any , we see that it is not possible to obtain a code with these parameters from the class of constacyclic codes either.  Let , , , and .

From the factorizations of and we observe that neither a cyclic nor a constacyclic code exists for length 33 and dimension 12. Moreover, since , a 1-generator QT code with these parameters does not exist either.">
