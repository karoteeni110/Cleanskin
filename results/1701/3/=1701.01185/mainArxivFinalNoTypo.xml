    <abstract>This paper shows how to carry out efficient asymptotic variance
reduction when estimating volatility in the presence of stochastic
volatility and microstructure noise with the realized kernels (RK) from
and the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) studied in . To obtain
such a reduction, we chop the data into blocks, compute the RK (or QMLE)
on each block, and aggregate the block estimates. The ratio of
asymptotic variance over the bound of asymptotic efficiency converges as
increases to the ratio in the parametric version of the problem, i.e.
1.0025 in the case of the fastest RK Tukey-Hanning 16 and 1 for the
QMLE. The impact of stochastic sampling times and jump in the price
process is examined carefully. The finite sample performance of both
estimators is investigated in simulations, while empirical work
illustrates the gain in practice. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Over the past decades, the availability of high frequency data has led to a better understanding of asset prices. The main object of interest, the quadratic variation, can be used for example as a proxy for the spot volatility or the volatility parameter of a time-varying model. Moreover, forecasts of future volatility can be improved with it. Without microstructure noise, the realized variance (RV) estimator (e.g. , , ) is both consistent and efficient. The convergence rate and the asymptotic variance (AVAR) were established in , and (see also and ).  Under market frictions, the RV is no longer consistent. bring forward the Two-Scale Realized Volatility nonparametric estimator, the first consistent estimator in the presence of noise and with a relatively slow convergence rate of . modifies it to provide the Multi-Scale Realized Volatility (MSRV) which features the optimal rate of convergence as documented in . Other approaches consist in and are not limited to: pre-averaging (PAE) the observations (), advocates for the realized kernels (RK) and studies the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) which was originally considered in when volatility is constant. Those three approaches share the optimal rate property and only differ through edge-effects which impact their respective AVAR.  The nonparametric AVAR bound of efficiency is equal to , where stands for the time horizon and corresponds to the noise variance. This was shown in under the deterministic volatility and Gaussian noise setting, but it is commonly assumed that it stays true under stochastic volatility. Subsequently, in a recent breakthrough paper, found an estimator based on the spectral approach introduced in which reaches the bound in a very general situation. More recently, proposed an adapted version of the pre-averaging estimator using local estimates as in which gave rise to estimators that are within 7% of the bound.  To be fair when comparing several estimators, we need the candidates to be equipped with the same technology. Following closely the local technique used in and more recently in , we aim to adapt accordingly the RK and the QMLE. Indeed, although both estimators behave remarkably well when volatility is constant, i.e. in the parametric case the ratio of AVAR over the bound of asymptotic efficiency is 1.0025 when considering the most efficient Tukey-Hanning 16 RK and 1 for the QMLE, they can actually be highly inefficient in the non-parametric setting as documented in the following of this introduction and in Section 2. Under time-varying volatility, we aim to reduce significantly their AVAR and make them efficient. Although it would reduce the AVAR the same way, we did not implement the local version of the MSRV. In fact, MSRV and RK are asymptotically equivalent in the sense that they share the same asymptotic variance when considering the same kernel (see Section 2.2 in ).  To reduce the variance, we divide the interval into non-overlapping regular blocks , , , . We then compute the RK (QMLE) on each block, and take the sum of the estimates. We show that the nonparametric ratio of AVAR over the bound of efficiency converges to the parametric ratio as increases. More importantly for practical applications, the convergence is very fast, and the gain is already important in the case blocks.  As an example, we focus on the RK Tukey-Hanning 16 and consider the (apparently innocuous) block constant model for and for . When choosing the optimal bandwidth, [^1] showed that the AVAR is equal to where is defined as with and where are constant functions of the kernel. We fix and we compute in that case , and . Thus, the bound of efficiency is equal to , whereas . This can be expressed as a loss of , which is to be compared to the loss in the parametric case[^2] . When fixing , the volatility on each block is constant and thus yields on the first block and on the second block. As both estimates are uncorrelated[^3], we obtain that the global AVAR is equal to , i.e. .25 % loss which corresponds exactly to the parametric loss.  From ( ), we can see that the theoretical loss can be expressed as a deterministic function of the already well-known measure of volatility constancy and another connected quantity which we denote Details can be found in Section 2, along with an expression for the QMLE loss as well. In the previous example where the loss was about , the corresponding setting can be computed as and . Volatility on real data is moving more than on this toy example, corresponding to lower and . In their empirical study, daily estimate and find that the typical value is around 1.3, and about 1.6 when restricting to the top 10% days in terms of intraday variation of volatility. This corresponds respectively to estimates of as and . When taking respectively those two realistic values, the corresponding RK and QMLE losses are expected to be around 20% (can go up to 100 %), depending on the other parameter value . With such highly inefficient estimators, we believe that there is a practical need for variance reduction. This is especially the case on days when the volatility is moving a lot.  Clearly this estimator is related to local parametric methods in high-frequency data, i.e. aggregating local parametric estimates. For example, investigated the ex post adjustment involving asymptotic likelihood ratios to make when assuming constant local volatility. showed the asymptotic equivalence in Le Cam’s sense between the non-parametric and locally constant volatility experiment. To estimate quarticity and other functionals of volatility, estimated the volatility locally and plugged the value into the sum. Our work includes , , .  The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 stretches the limitations of the global approach by expressing the loss as a function of and . In Section 3, we provide the model, investigate the RK and the QMLE and their corresponding limit theory. Section 4 investigates what happens to both methods when considering stochastic arrival times and adding jump in the price process. Section 5 performs a Monte Carlo experiment to assess finite sample performance and AVAR reduction. Section 6 provides an empirical illustration where we quantify the expected gain in practice. Theoretical details and proofs can be found in the Appendix.  [^1]: see pp. 1494-1495 for more details.  [^2]: Details can be found on Table II (p. 1495, ).  [^3]: if we remove end-effects.">

<outline text="Limitations of the global approach" _note="This section documents the performance of the global RK and QMLE. In particular, we show how it deteriorates as a function of heteroskedasticity. Finally, we diagnose the reasons and provide the solution to this relative failure.  One crucial feature common to both estimators is that they behave remarkably well when volatility is constant. Indeed, the QMLE is efficient and the RK Tukey-Hanning 16 almost efficient in that case. Even the RK Tukey-Hanning 2, with an AVAR over the bound of efficiency ratio of less than 1.04, can be considered as “practically efficient”. To study what happens when volatility is time-varying, it is useful for to define to be measures of heteroskedasticity. In the following, we will be using and in place of and . The quantity was already introduced in and plays an important role in the AVAR of both RK and the QMLE. (Figure 1, p. 241) expresses the quotient of both AVARs as a function of , but does not assess their respective performance when compared to the (conjectured) bound of efficiency defined as In contrast, the other quantity is introduced to investigate that relative performance. More precisely, is needed to express the AVAR over the bound of efficiency ratio for both approaches since the AVAR does not feature the tricity, i.e. the integrated third moment of volatility, which is key in the bound of efficiency. Evidently, both measures and are very much connected and we can actually show that we have that  Note that the equality for all corresponds to the parametric case. In particular, Eq. ( ) implies that for any given , the value is a.s. in a small boundary around . This is of particular interest because as far as the authors know under noisy observations the literature on quarticity estimation[^1] is far more abundant than the corresponding work on estimating tricity [^2], which implies that in practice can be estimated relatively easily, whereas would require more effort. From (Figure 7, p. 41), when taking a pre-averaging window equal to one minute (chosen consistently with their recommendation in Section 5.2.4 on p. 34 where the authors argue that a reasonable choice of window should lie between 30 seconds and 2 minutes) we infer that the estimates of are about , and when considering respectively the bottom 10% days in terms of intraday variation of volatility, all days and the top 10% days in terms of intraday variation of volatility. Correspondingly, we will be using , , to refer respectively to high, regular and low values of throughout the rest of the paper. It is not surprising to find such low values on stocks data as it has been understood for several decades now that many stylized facts describe volatility as time-varying (see, e.g., , ).  When using the optimal bandwidth, is defined as where we have with constant functions of the kernel. Correspondingly, we give the formal definition of the RK loss as Obvious computations lead to . If we see as a function of , is equal to in the parametric case. The parametric values for several kernels can be directly inferred from (Table II, p. 1495) and the loss is equal to .25 % when considering the Tukey-Hanning 16, 3.625 % for the Tukey-Hanning 2, 6.75 % for the Parzen and 13 % for the Cubic kernel. We have that is an increasing function of , and thus the effect of and are reverse. Next we consider the AVAR of the QMLE expressed via The formula can actually be found in Box V (p. 240, ). The corresponding QMLE loss is defined in analogy with ( ) and can be expressed as Figure   plots the feasible loss region for three typical RK, the QMLE and the PAE with triangle kernel. It is clear that they highly lose efficiency when is decreasing. The QMLE is dominated by the RK approach when is low, which was observed on Figure 1 (p. 241, ).  The problem behind this potentially high loss can be intuitively explained as follows. For the RK, although the optimal tuning parameter is robust to time-varying volatility, it suffers from the fact that one day[^3] is too long to “stay optimal”. This is a very similar situation to the PAE, which also features a tuning parameter. Subsequently, used block estimations to heavily reduce variance. As for the QMLE, which in contrast is designed in a parametric way yielding no choice of tuning parameter, the smaller and are, the further the misspecified model deviates from the truth. It is by nature a different estimator, but local methods are expected to reduce the misspecification as in . Thus, we aim to reduce the non-parametric loss into the parametric loss using adapted local methods. As we can see on Figure  , the QMLE will benefit the most as it is efficient in the parametric case and deteriorates more than the RK in the non-parametric case.  [^1]: see, e.g., , , , and .

As pointed out in (p. 431), any deterministic grid satisfies the above conditions. Actually, this model can be considered as more general than the time deformation proposed by (Section 5.3, pp. 1505-1507) in the sense that more complex arrival times, such as a Poisson process independent of the other quantities fall under the model. On the contrary, assuming the existence of the quadratic variation of time (see, e.g., Assumption A on p. 1939 in ) is too general as our proofs require the existence of the quadratic covariation of time lags for all lags[^2].  Since the price process features possible jumps, the two estimators are no longer consistent to the integrated volatility, but they converge to the quadratic variation where corresponds to the size of the jump if there is a jump at time and 0 otherwise.

  <outline text="Simulation design" _note="We implement the above procedures for Monte Carlo simulations of intraday returns on the time interval , year (that is working day). One working day is in turn subdivided in seconds corresponding to hours of trading activity. For each model, the corresponding trajectories are generated from a classical Euler scheme based on intervals, that is one observation every seconds. We simulate more observations prior and post main trading period in order to compute properly different that are necessary for the RK. Indeed, using their truncated versions tend to generate a non-negligible bias as pointed out in (see Table 2 on p. 243), so that we prefer to overcome this issue with a few minutes of out-of-sample data. Finally, we also use observations based on sparsely sampled versions of the original trajectories, for a number of intervals taking on the values , , and , the latter corresponding to having one observation every seconds, which still corresponds to a fairly heavily traded stock. We do not report the results for lower frequencies, but the theory still kicks in for sparser samplings too.  We consider three stochastic volatility models to simulate the intraday returns, along with three levels of mean noise-to-signal ratios , and . The three values are empirically corroborated in , where the authors report empirical values of for several stocks ranging from to (see Table 3 on p. 147). We introduce now the volatility models, which have been designed to reflect different average values of ranging from (corresponding to a high value) for Model 1, (corresponding to a regular value) for Model 2 to (corresponding to a low value) for Model 3 as reported on Table  . The three models can all be represented as a Heston stochastic volatility model (SV) with U-shape intraday volatility pattern and a possible jump whose occurrence time is picked up uniformly randomly on a subinterval of . Except for the jump component, this general model is directly inspired from Model 4 in , and (see Section 6.1 on p. 242). We assume that the log price process and the volatility process follow the dynamics with Here and are two standard Brownian motions with . Note that jumps at time , that we define as a uniform random variable on . controls the size of the jump. The choice of making jumps, instead of the global volatility , is merely a way to ensure that remains positive. Finally, the drift parameter and the stochastic volatility part remain constant for each model.

Such robustness proved to be crucial in our procedure as it is well known that estimators for the quarticity can be unstable in finite sample when the amount of data is not large.

Here we generate different values of as a function of the jump time, which we restrict to be in so that each can be associated to a distinct jump time on that interval. We choose this particular model because the sample mean of is .77 which corresponds to a regular value, and the panel of generated values is sufficiently large compared to the other two models.

If we consider the lower value , the QMLE losses for the first four values of are equal to , , and . The corresponding RK values are , , and . This suggests that the convergence to the loss bounds (which we recall to be equal to when considering the RK Tukey-Hanning 2 and for the QMLE) is very fast for both approaches. Actually for any reasonable taken to be between 0.5 and 1, choosing is big enough for the loss to stay within (or ), and it is usually far below this threshold with regular and high values of .  Moreover, we can see on the left lower panel in Figure   that when is relatively high, the QMLE outperforms the RK approach when considering , and the gap gets bigger as we increase . In contrast when , the QMLE is outperformed when considering only one block, but eventually makes it back when incrementing the value of . The actual value required to fill up the gap is getting bigger as decreases. This suggests that both approaches are complementary to each other. Finally, the lower left panel in Figure   documents that both approaches dominate the PAE regardless of the number of blocks.  [^1]: Useful details on this model can be found in Section      .">

  <outline text="Results" _note="We first report the finite sample properties of the four statistics in Table  -  for Model 2 under the noise level . We can see that the results are promising at any level of sampling, as the RMSE of the -statistic does not suffer much from the increasing in the number of blocks, especially for the QMLE for which the RMSE of stays closely in line with . The results also indicate that the asymptotic theory eventually kicks in for all the estimators as the standard deviation of the statistics decreases to when the sampling frequency increases. Nevertheless, we can see a slight over dispersion compared to what was reported in and . For the QMLE, this is due to the strong difference with the noise-to-signal ratio that was used in where . Concerning the RK, the difference in the studentization is due to the fact that the authors in do not employ for the studentization, but a non-asymptotic variance as documented in Section 4.4 (pp. 1496-1498) of their work. The feasible statistics are slightly biased, and this is due to the estimation of the AVAR procedure.  We then report the theoretical loss values and the empirical loss for two levels of sampling and , and three levels of noise-to-signal ratios , and in Table  . First, we can note that the theoretical loss behaves in a very similar way as in Section   for the three models. In particular, this implies that neither the SV part nor the steep U component seems to have a bad impact for the local method. Also, one can see that when choosing the theoretical loss is at most more than the parametric loss (which we recall to be equal to 3.625 % for the RK Tukey-Hanning 2 and 0% in the case of the QMLE), which are in line with the threshold found in Section  .  Second, the loss due to the finite sample behaves in a very proper way when increases. For any setting and both estimators, it is roughly constant as a function of , although suffering more when is higher and smaller. This is perfectly in line with the findings in Table   and Table  . In particular for Model 2 and Model 3, the finite sample effect is almost not moving as increases. For Model 1, this is basically the same picture for the QMLE, but the empirical loss seems to stagnate between and when using the RK. This is not surprising as the RK suffers more from the finite sample effect than the QMLE as seen in Table   and Table  .  Third, note that the decomposition where denotes the sample variance of based on the Monte Carlo simulations, is numerically well-verified and gives an intuitive interpretation of the main sources of deviation from the bound in practice. For instance, consider on Model 2, with , . In that case, the previous decomposition ( ) gives for the left hand side, and for the right hand side which is very close to the other value indeed.  Finally, this simulation study indicates that the local version of RK and the QMLE perform very well in practice, with the QMLE slightly more robust to the values of and as free of tuning parameters.">

<outline text="Empirical illustration" _note="We conclude this study by the application of our method on transaction log prices of Intel Corporation (INTC) shares recorded on the NASDAQ stock market over the year 2015. We exclude January 1, the day after Thanksgiving and December 24 which are less active, thus this leaves us with 250 trading days of data. Moreover, we only keep transactions that were carried out between 9:30am and 4pm. Finally, we consider the data in tick time, for an average of daily trades. The most active days include more than trades.  We first estimate the theoretical gain in AVAR. As for the numerical study, we do not cap by . Across the days, values of and blocks corresponding to an overall of 5,250 estimates, the value was crossed only a few times. We report in Table   key statistics for AVAR reduction. We get a global estimate of around , which is very close to . Across the year the estimates of ranged from around to , and actually crossed for two days where it reached and . When increases, we find as expected that , the mean estimated value of across days and blocks, also increases to reach a value of for blocks. Accordingly, the mean estimated ratios of AVAR decreases from to for the QMLE, and from to for the RK. Moreover, we find that those ratios are consistently smaller than for the 250 days and different values of bigger than 1, so that the local method never deteriorates the AVAR of the estimator. Note that the same ratios for Model 2 in our simulation study range from to for the QMLE and from to for the RK. The slight disparity between the empirical study and Model 2 can be explained in several ways. For example, it is likely that we still under-evaluate the difference between and , or that the theoretical model is a little too optimistic about how fast gets close to on local blocks. To sum up, the results are approximately in line with what was expected, and present a substantial gain in terms of AVAR for both the QMLE and the RK.  The last column in Table   shows the empirical correlation between the correction terms and for several values of . The positive correlation indicates that the local method tends to correct the global estimates in the same direction for both the QMLE and the RK. Moreover, increasing the number of blocks amplifies the phenomenon. Table   shows the empirical mean and standard deviation of the estimators. Note that the main source of randomness being the target value itself, it is not surprising to find the mean and standard values very close to each other. We have reported in the last column the correlation between each estimator and the global QMLE. We find results very close to for all estimators. One should note that the global RK is less correlated to the QMLE than all the local QMLE . This indicates that the order of magnitude of the correction induced by the local method is smaller than the difference between the two global estimators.  Finally, Figure   shows daily 95% theoretical confidence intervals for , , and in May 2015. We can see that the confidence intervals for the local estimators are often shorter than their counterpart. Moreover, over the year the global and the local estimates confidence intervals always overlap, corroborating the fact that the local estimates are in line with their global versions.">

<outline text="Conclusion" _note="In this paper, we have looked at the efficiency of local methods to estimate integrated volatility. We have shown that for the RK and the QMLE, if we chop the data into blocks we can reduce the AVAR when is fixed and retrieve the parametric loss when goes to infinity. We have also seen that the theoretical gain is mostly preserved when looking at finite sample results. Finally, we have documented that the gain is substantial in practice.  Given how simple to implement the methodology is, we expect that it will be very helpful for practitioners. Our hope is that this simple and natural technique will be used on the QMLE and the RK, but also considered for a wider class of estimators. It is clear that the theory would work for the PAE and the MSRV, but econometricians should also try it on their own favorite estimator. Actually, the technique can be applied to other problems, such as the high-frequency covariance estimation, the estimation of functions of volatility, the leverage effect, the volatility of volatility, etc.">

We further define the diagonal scaling matrix \_n = [diag]{.nodecor}(N\_n\^[1/2]{},N\_n), and consider for the scaled score functions We start by showing the consistency of the QMLE. Before stating the result, we give a few definitions. For a matrix , we associate the matrix and whose components respectively satisfy \_[i,j]{} = a\_[i+1,j]{} - a\_[i,j]{}, and \_[i,j]{} = \_[i,j+1]{} - \_[i,j]{} = a\_[i+1,j+1]{} - a\_[i,j+1]{} + a\_[i,j]{} - a\_[i+1,j]{}, with the convention when or . This will be useful to disentangle some quadratic expressions using the following result.    Let , with , . We define , and the same way. Then we have the by-part summation identities  We now show a preliminary lemma to get the consistency of the QMLE.    (Asymptotic score) For any , let \_() = ł(  -ł(\_0\^T\_s\^2ds+ \_[0&amp;lt;sT]{}J\_s\^2 -\^2T)-ł(a\^2-a\_0\^2)\ ł(a\^2-a\_0\^2)  ). We have  \_ ł|\_n()-\_()| 0.    We start by treating the case where the jump part . We have the decomposition with R\_n() &amp; = &amp; ł(  ł{ Y\^T Y - [tr]{.nodecor} ł( ł{\_0\^c + \_0\^d })}\ ł{ Y\^T Y - [tr]{.nodecor} ł( ł{\_0\^c + \_0\^d })}  ). By a straightforward adaptation of the proof of Lemma 1-2 and Theorem 4 in , we have immediately that uniformly in the parameters since the step size of the observation grid by ( ). Thus it is sufficient to show that we have Equality ( ) is then a direct consequence of equations (38) and (40) pp. 247-248 in that are obtained following exactly the same proof as pp.247-248 for an irregular grid such that .  When there are jumps, there is an additional term in ( ) which is equal to A\_n() = ł(  ł{ł(J\^n)\^T J\^n + 2ł(J\^n)\^T ł{\^n + \^n} }\ ł{ł(J\^n)\^T J\^n + 2ł(J\^n)\^T ł{\^n + \^n} }  ), so that it is sufficient to show that we have \_ ł|A\_n()+ł(  \_[0&amp;lt;sT]{}J\_s\^2\ 0  )| 0. We first compute the limit of the term . Recalling that is the -th index of , we provide the following decomposition: ł(J\^n)\^T J\^n = \_[i = 1]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł(J\_[i]{}\^n)\^2 + \_[1 j &amp;lt; i N\_n]{}[ J\_[i]{}\^nJ\_[j]{}\^n]{}. Now, we define the jump times of , where is the random number of jumps of on . Since is finite, there exists a random number such that for we have \_[i = 1]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł(J\_[i]{}\^n)\^2 = \_[k=1]{}\^[N\^J]{} J\_[\_k]{}\^2. By direct calculation from the expression of the coefficients of in (28) p. 245 in , we easily deduce that for each we have uniformly in . Since the sum is finite, this yields the uniform convergence \_[ł| ł(J\^n)\^T J\^n + \_[0&amp;lt;sT]{}J\_s\^2 |]{} 0. By a similar argument, we also have for that exponentially so that we have uniformly. As for , on the one hand the same computation yields that the leading term of is \_[k=1]{}\^[N\^J]{} \_[O\_(1)]{} J\_[\_k]{} \_[o\_(1)]{}, where , so that as the sum is finite the expression is negligible. On the other hand, we also have by Lemma   that the leading term of the noise part is -\_[k=1]{}\^[N\^J]{} \_[O\_(N\_n\^[-1/2]{})]{} J\_[\_k]{} \_[O\_(1)]{} since by direct calculation. Finally, similar reasoning shows that the second component of is negligible because of the scaling in instead of , and we are done.  Now we turn to the consistency of the QMLE.  (consistency). If is the QMLE, we have  \_n \_0:= ł(\_0\^2, a\_0\^2),   where we recall that .

Given the form of , the equality is immediate. Note also that the left hand side inequality of ( ) will be automatically satisfied if we show that as soon as by a continuity argument since is compact. Let us then take such that , and assume first that . In that case, we have which leads to a contradiction. Similarly, the first component of leads to the domination so that we can conclude .  We now turn to the convergence of the Fisher information related to our likelihood field. Let and be the scaled Hessian matrices of the likelihood fields, defined for any as  H\_n() = -\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_n\^[-1/2]{} [and]{.nodecor} \_n() = -\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_n\^[-1/2]{}.    (Asymptotic Fisher information)   Let be the matrix (\_0) = ł(  &amp; 0\ 0 &amp;  ). We have, for any ball centred on , shrinking to , \_[\_n V\_n]{} ł H\_n(\_n) - (\_0) 0.  First note that a small adaptation of Lemma 1-2 with second order derivatives of from yields since . Now, , bottom of p. 247 and after equation (41) on p. 248, can be easily adapted to our case replacing by as in the previous lemma, so that we have \_ ł{\_n() - \_()} 0, with \_() := ł(  + + &amp;0\ 0&amp;-  ). It is immediate to check that \_(\_0) = ł(  &amp;0\ 0&amp;  ).  We now adopt similar notations to in the proof of Lemma 3 (p. 248) and define the processes involved in the derivation of the central limit theorem. For , and , we define M\_[1]{}\^[()]{}(t) &amp; := &amp; \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n(t)]{}[ł{ł(X\_[i,t]{}\^n)\^2 - \_[t\_[i-1]{}\^n t ]{}\^[t\_[i]{}\^n t]{}[\_s\^2ds]{} - \_[t\_[i-1]{}\^n t &amp;lt;s t\_[i]{}\^n t]{} J\_s\^2}]{},  \ M\_[2]{}\^[()]{}(t) &amp; := &amp; \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n(t)]{} ł{\_[1 j &amp;lt; i]{} X\_[j,t]{}\^n} X\_[i,t]{}\^n,  \ M\_[3]{}\^[()]{}(t) &amp; := &amp;- 2\_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n(t)]{} ł{\_[j = 1]{}\^[N\_n(t)]{} X\_[j,t]{}\^n} \_[t\_i\^n]{},  \ M\_[4]{}\^[()]{}(t) &amp; := &amp; \_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n(t)]{}[ł{\_[t\_i\^n]{}\^2 - a\_0\^2} ]{} + 2\_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n(t)]{} ł{\_[0 j &amp;lt; i]{} \_[t\_j\^n]{}} \_[t\_i\^n]{},   where in all the definitions ( )-( ), the terms involving the parameters such as , , , are evaluated at point , for some .

In the next few lemmas we investigate the limit of each one of those terms. In the presence of jumps and random observation times, we will see that they are not mere extensions of Lemma 3 in and that additional variance terms appear in the limits. We start by .    We have  \_n\^[-1/2]{} M\_1(T) 0.  We have to show and . We start with the case where . We are going to show that for any we actually have .

Moreover, , thus by Lemma 2.2.11 in , it is sufficient to show that .

In the presence of jumps, it remains to show that the additional terms and are negligible. From the finite activity property, note that the first one is identically for sufficiently large. Again, for sufficiently large, defining the finite number of jumps of on , we can write the second term as 2N\_n\^[-1/4]{}\_[k=1]{}\^[N\^J]{}\_[O\_(N\_n\^[1/2]{})]{} J\_[\_k]{} \_[O\_(n\^[-1/2+1/2]{})]{} 0. where is such that , and where we have used **(H)**. This concludes the proof.    We have -stably in law that  N\_n\^[-1/4]{} M\_[2]{}\^[(\^2)]{}(T) ł( 0, \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}ł{\_0\^T[\_s\^4 \_sds]{} + \_[0 s T]{} J\_s\^2 (\_s\^2\_s + \_[s-]{}\^2\_[s-]{}) }) and N\_n\^[-1/2]{} M\_[2]{}\^[(a\^2)]{}(T) 0.  As usual, we start by the case with no jumps, that is . We show the result for . The proof is conducted in three steps.  **Step 1.** We consider , and we define as \_2\^[(\^2)]{}(t) := \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł{\_[(i- L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} \_[j,i-L\_n-1,t]{}\^n} \_[i,i-L\_n-1,t]{}\^n,   that is when the increments are replaced by variables of the form , where is the value of the volatility process at the beginning of the truncated sum. We show that we have . We decompose N\_n\^[-1/4]{}ł{M\_2\^[(\^2)]{} -\_2\^[(\^2)]{} } = R\_n\^[(1)]{}+R\_n\^[(2)]{}+R\_n\^[(3)]{}, with R\_n\^[(1)]{} &amp; = &amp; N\_n\^[-1/4]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{}\_[1 j &amp;lt; i - L\_n]{} X\_[j,t]{}\^n X\_[i,t]{}\^n,  \ R\_n\^[(2)]{} &amp; = &amp; N\_n\^[-1/4]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{}\_[(i- L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i ]{} X\_[j,t]{}\^n (X\_[i,t]{}\^n - \_[i,i-L\_n-1,t]{}\^n),  \ R\_n\^[(3)]{} &amp; = &amp; N\_n\^[-1/4]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{}\_[(i- L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} ( X\_[j,t]{}\^n - \_[j,i-L\_n-1,t]{}\^n ) \_[i,i-L\_n-1,t]{}\^n.   Now, proving that is negligible is immediate because when , we have the domination for some so that by an easy application of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and estimates from Lemma   we get . Now we show the negligibility of . Assume first that has no jumps, i.e . being a sum of martingale increments, it is sufficient to show that where .

We have by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality P\_n\^[(1)]{} &amp;&amp; N\_n\^[-1/2]{}\_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[(i- L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} ł()\^2 ł(\_ ł  \_  )\^[1/2]{},\ &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[-1/2]{}n\^[-3+3]{}L\_n \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[(i- L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} ł()\^2\ &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[2]{}n\^[-3+3]{}L\_n 0, as by ( ), and by the same estimate as for ( ) for the Itô semimartingale . For , we first note that for we have ł|\_ł | &amp;&amp; \_ł ds | \]\ &amp;&amp; L \_ł ds| \]\ &amp;&amp; L n\^[-3 + 3]{} L\_n\^[1/2]{}, where the last step is obtained using **(H)** as for the previous estimates. Overall, we get P\_n\^[(2)]{} &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[-1/2]{}n\^[-3 + 3]{} L\_n\^[1/2]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[(i-L\_n) 1 j k &amp;lt; i]{}\ &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[-1/2]{}n\^[-3 + 3]{} L\_n\^[3/2]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[(i-L\_n)1 j &amp;lt; i]{} ł()\^2\ &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[2]{}n\^[-3 + 3]{} L\_n\^[3/2]{} 0. Finally, when , we write the same decomposition as ( ), and we note that the exact same calculation as in the case for remains valid. Moreover, following closely the calculation above, we get by orthogonality of the Brownian motions and . When has jumps of finite activity, we easily show as for previous calculations that an additional negligible term appears in , and thus combining all those results we have . Finally, is proven following the same line of reasoning as for .\  **Step 2.** We are going to apply Theorem 2-1 p. 238 from to the continuous martingale . Condition (2.8) is automatically satisfied with . We now show the variance condition (2.9). This boils down to showing that there exists an increasing limit process such that for any  ł\_2\^[(\^2)]{},\_2\^[(\^2)]{} \_t C\_t,   and . We introduce L\_n\^[(1)]{} &amp; := &amp; N\_n\^[-1/2]{}\_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{}\_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} [ł()\^2 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4ł(W\_[j,t]{}\^n)\^2[t\_[i,t]{}\^n]{}]{},\ L\_n\^[(2)]{} &amp; := &amp; N\_n\^[-1/2]{}\_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j k &amp;lt; i]{} [\_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4W\_[j,t]{}\^nW\_[k,t]{}\^n [t\_[i,t]{}\^n]{}]{}.\ we have , so that our strategy to show ( ) will be to prove that L\_n\^[(1)]{} &amp; &amp; C\_t  \ L\_n\^[(2)]{} &amp; &amp; 0.  For , we have directly that is equal to N\_n\^[-1]{} \_\_ \_ł  t\_[j,t]{}\^n t\_[k,t]{}\^n t\_[i\_1,t]{}\^nt\_[i\_2,t]{}\^n, where we have used that for , we have when and , and the expectation is null otherwise. Now, using the boundedness of and the fact that by assumption **(H)**, we obtain \_ł  L N\_n\^[-1]{}n\^[-4+4]{}\_\_, which by direct calculation on the coefficients yields \_ł  &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[-1]{} n\^[-4+4]{} N\_n\^4 L\_n\ &amp;&amp; N\_n\^[7/2 +]{}n\^[-4+4]{}0, for and small enough. Now we turn to ( ). We define , and we further decompose into L\_n\^[(1)]{} - C\_t = \_[i=1]{}\^[6]{} B\_n\^[(i)]{}, with B\_n\^[(1)]{} &amp; = &amp; N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} [ł()\^2 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 ł(ł(W\_[j,t]{}\^n)\^2 - t\_[j,t]{}\^n)ł([t\_[i]{}\^n]{}t - [t\_[i-1]{}\^n]{}t)]{},\ B\_n\^[(2)]{} &amp; = &amp;N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_n \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} [ł()\^2 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 ł(\_[[t\_[j-1]{}\^n]{}]{}-\_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{})U\_j\^nł([t\_[i]{}\^n]{}t - [t\_[i-1]{}\^n]{}t)]{},\ B\_n\^[(3)]{} &amp; = &amp; N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_n \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} [ł()\^2 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{} ł(U\_j\^n - 1 )ł([t\_[i]{}\^n]{}t - [t\_[i-1]{}\^n]{}t)]{},\ B\_n\^[(4)]{} &amp; = &amp; \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł{N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_n\_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} [ł()\^2 - \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}]{}} \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{} ł([t\_[i]{}\^n]{}t - [t\_[i-1]{}\^n]{}t),\ B\_n\^[(5)]{} &amp; = &amp; \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}\_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{}[ł{\_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{} - \_[[t\_[i]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 \_[[t\_[i]{}\^n]{}]{} } ł([t\_[i]{}\^n]{}t - [t\_[i-1]{}\^n]{}t)]{},\ B\_n\^[(6)]{} &amp; = &amp; \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}ł{\_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{}[\_[[t\_[i]{}\^n]{}]{}\^4 \_[[t\_[i]{}\^n]{}]{} ł([t\_[i]{}\^n]{}t - [t\_[i-1]{}\^n]{}t)]{} - \_0\^t[\_s\^4\_sds]{}}. Using that if , and otherwise, we obtain the estimate \_ł  L N\_n\^[3]{}L\_n n\^[-4+4]{} 0. Moreover, by the same deviation inequality as ( ) for (recall that is an Itô semimartingale) we have so that we obtain easily . Similar computation to that of shows that since and when . is a direct consequence of the fact that by a direct calculation we have uniformly in that and that by ( ), recalling that . is, again a simple consequence of the deviation inequality ( ) for the Itô semimartingale , and finally is just the convergence of the Riemann sum toward the integral limit, and we are done. We show condition (2.10), i.e. that N\_n\^[-1/4]{} \_2\^[(\^2)]{}, W \_t 0. Note that N\_n\^[-1/4]{} \_2\^[(\^2)]{}, W \_t = N\_n\^[-1/4]{} \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_[ (i-L\_n) 1 j &amp;lt; i]{} \_[[t\_[i-L\_n-1]{}\^n]{}]{}\^2 W\_[j,t]{}\^n t\_[i,t]{}\^n, so that by a straightforward calculation on the Brownian motion increments we have \_ł  L N\_n\^2 L\_n n\^[-3+3]{} 0. Moreover, condition (2.11) is satisfied because is continuous. Finally we show condition (2.12). But note that for any bounded martingale orthogonal to we have directly \_2\^[(\^2)]{}, \_t = 0 by ( ), so that all the conditions required for the theorem hold.  **Step 3.** In the presence of jumps, for large enough, an additional term appears in . First, since is of finite activity and by the Grigelionis decomposition for Itô-semimartingales (see e.g. Theorem 2.1.2 in ), we can assume without loss of generality that the jump times of are a subset of the support of a Poisson random measure on for some arbitrary Polish space, adapted to , and with finite intensity measure . Let thus , ,, be an exhausting sequence for the jumps of . Since is of finite activity, for sufficiently large we cannot have more than a single jump on intervals of the form because by assumption **(H)**. Therefore, if is large enough, after a simple rearrangement of the terms that contain jumps, and by the previous calculation in the continuous case, we can write under the form M\_[2]{}\^[(\^2)]{}(t) = \_2\^[(\^2)]{}(t) + A\_n\^+(t) + A\_n\^-(t) + o\_(1),   with A\_n\^+(t) = \_[p 1]{}[J\_[\_p]{}\_[j = i\_p + 1]{}\^[i\_p + L\_n]{} \_[j,t]{}\^n ]{} [and]{.nodecor} A\_n\^-(t) = \_[p 1]{}[J\_[\_p]{}\_[j = i\_p - L\_n ]{}\^[i\_p - 1 ]{} \_[j,t]{}\^n ]{}, where is such that . We define  M\_n\^+(t,p) = \_[j = i\_p + 1]{}\^[i\_p + L\_n]{} \_[j,t]{}\^n [and]{.nodecor} M\_n\^-(t,p) = \_[j = i\_p - L\_n ]{}\^[i\_p - 1 ]{} \_[j,t]{}\^n, along with the following infinite dimensional vector such that , and are i.i.d standard normal random variables. We can assume that and are rich enough to include such random variables information without loss of generality, since we can always construct a very good filtered extension as explained in pp. 36-37 of . Now define V\_:= \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}, M\_\^+(p) := \_[\_p]{}\_[\_p]{}\^[1/2]{}V\_\^[1/2]{}R\_\^+(p) [and]{.nodecor} M\_\^-(p) := \_[\_p-]{}\_[\_p-]{}\^[1/2]{}V\_\^[1/2]{} R\_\^-(p), and := C\_T\^[1/2]{} G, where was defined in ( ). We are going to show that -stably in law, we have the convergence N\_n\^[-1/4]{} (\_[2]{}\^[(\^2)]{}(T), (M\_n\^+(T,p),M\_n\^-(T,p))\_[p 1]{}) (, (M\_\^+(p),M\_\^-(p))\_[p 1]{}).   As the subset of finite dimensional cylinders is a convergence determining class for the product topology of , it is sufficient to show that the above convergence holds for all finite families of the form , . Now, let us consider the filtration which is the smallest filtration containing and the jump times of , . By independence of and the Wiener process , is also a continuous Itô process with respect to the filtration , so that is a multi-dimensional continuous -martingale. Now, for large enough and by the finite activity property, we have for any , M\_n\^+(.,p\_i), M\_n\^+(.,p\_j) \_t = M\_n\^-(.,p\_i), M\_n\^-(.,p\_j) \_t = 0 [a.s,]{.nodecor} and M\_n\^+(.,p\_i), M\_n\^-(.,p\_i) \_t = 0 [a.s.]{.nodecor} Moreover N\_n\^[-1/2]{}M\_n\^+(.,p\_i),M\_n\^+(.,p\_i)\_t = N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_[j = i\_p +1]{}\^[i\_p + L\_n]{} ł()\^2 \_[[t\_[j-1]{}\^n]{} t]{}\^[[t\_[j]{}\^n]{} t]{}[\_s\^2ds]{}, since the random index is -measurable. By a similar (but easier) calculation than for above, we have N\_n\^[-1/2]{}M\_n\^+(.,p\_i),M\_n\^+(.,p\_i)\_T \_[\_[p\_i]{}]{}\^2\_[\_[p\_i]{}]{} \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}, and also N\_n\^[-1/2]{}M\_n\^-(.,p\_i),M\_n\^-(.,p\_i)\_T \_[\_[p\_i]{}-]{}\^2\_[\_[p\_i]{}-]{} \_0\^T[\_s\^[-1]{}ds]{}. Finally we show the negligibility of and . We have  N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_2\^[(\^2)]{} ,M\_n\^+(.,p\_i)\_t = N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_[j=i\_p + 1]{}\^[i\_p + L\_n]{} \_[k=(j-L\_n) 1 ]{}\^[j-1]{} \_[k,t]{}\^n \_[j-L\_n-1]{}\^2 t\_[j,t]{}\^n, so that by Assumption **(H)** we have bounded by &amp; &amp; L N\_n\^[-1]{} n\^[-2+2]{} \_[j\_1,j\_2 = i\_p + 1]{}\^[i\_p + L\_n]{} \_[k = (j\_1 j\_2) - L\_n 1 ]{}\^[j\_1 j\_2 -1]{} \_ł \ &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^[-1]{} n\^[-3+3]{}\_[j\_1,j\_2 = i\_p + 1]{}\^[i\_p + L\_n]{} \_[k = (j\_1 j\_2) - L\_n 1 ]{}\^[j\_1 j\_2 -1]{}\ &amp;&amp; L N\_n\^2 L\_n n\^[-3+3]{} 0, and thus the bracket is negligible. By a similar calculation we get that the bracket involving is also negligible. Moreover, the convergence of was shown in ( ). Finally, as above we easily check the bracket of each martingale with either or a bounded martingale orthogonal to is negligible so that by another application of Theorem 2-1 in we have ( ). From the representation N\_n\^[-1/4]{}M\_2\^[(\^2)]{}(T) = N\_n\^[-1/4]{} ł{\_2\^[(\^2)]{}(T) + \_[p 1]{} J\_[\_p]{} (M\_n\^+(T,p)+M\_n\^+(T,p)) } + o\_(1), along with the fact that is finite, we deduce by the stable convergence ( ) that (and A FORTIORI ) stably in law N\_n\^[-1/4]{}M\_2\^[(\^2)]{}(T) + \_[p 1]{} J\_[\_p]{} (M\_\^+(p)+M\_\^-(p)), which is equal to the claimed distribution.  Finally, to show the convergence , note that and are equivalent up to a constant term so that all the above computations apply, and thus the scaling in instead of yields the negligibility of this term.  Before turning to the limiting distribution of the other terms, we recall that for a -field , a random vector and a sequence of random vectors in , we say that converges in law toward conditioned on if we have for any  ł  ł . Moreover, we recall in the following proposition a key result to combine stable convergence and conditional convergence. The proof of the result can be consulted in (proof of Proposition 5 on p. 1524).    Let be a given sub--field, and let and be sequences of random vectors, such that each is -measurable and the sequence converges -stably toward a limiting distribution , and converges in law conditioned on to some . Then -stably in distribution.    We have conditioned on the convergence in distribution N\_n\^[-1/4]{} M\_[3]{}\^[(\^2)]{}(T) ł( 0, ), and N\_n\^[-1/2]{} M\_[3]{}\^[(a\^2)]{}(T) 0,   where we recall the definition .  We start with . We apply a conditional version of Theorem 5.12 from (p. 92). Accordingly, we note that can be written as N\_n\^[-1/4]{}M\_[3]{}\^[(\^2)]{}(T) = \_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n]{} \_i\^n, where , are rowwise conditionally independent and centered given . To get the theorem, it is thus sufficient to show that \_[i=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł  ł{\_0\^T\_s\^2ds + \_[0sT]{}J\_s\^2},   and the Lindeberg condition, for any , \_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł  0. For ( ), we can write with T\_n\^[(1)]{} = 4a\_0\^2 N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n]{}\_[j=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} ł()\^2ł(X\_j\^n)\^2, and T\_n\^[(2)]{} =4a\_0\^2 N\_n\^[-1/2]{} \_[i=0]{}\^[N\_n]{}\_[jk=1]{}\^[N\_n]{} X\_j\^nX\_k\^n, and using same techniques as for the proof of Lemma   we easily get by direct calculation on the coefficients that we have , and . As for the Lindeberg condition, it is sufficient to notice that by independence of the Brownian increments and similar computation we have . Finally, for , all the previous calculation holds but now the scaling in implies that .    We have conditioned on the convergence in distribution \_n\^[-1/2]{} M\_4(T) ł(0,ł(  &amp;0\ 0&amp; +  )).  This is an immediate adaptation of (45) and (47) pp.248-249 in conditioned on in lieu of , since is independent of .  We consider now the general case , and accordingly we define for the local QMLE , and , the score functions on the block where all quantities are taken in the time interval . We also introduce the notation , and . The next lemma states the limit distribution of the vector . Finally we introduce the scaling factors along with the global scaling matrix .    We have for any , taking , stably in , the convergence in distribution  \_n\^[1/2]{}ł{\_n() - \_n()} ł(0,ł(  V\_[(1)]{} &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; V\_[(2)]{} &amp; 0 &amp;\ &amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 0&amp;&amp;&amp;V\_[(B)]{}  )), where for , is the two dimensional matrix defined by V\_[(i)]{} := ł(  ł(+ + ) &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; +  ), with and we recall that  First, for , we define the processes following the definitions ( )-( ) adapted to the time interval of length . Accordingly, for , we denote by the vector process , and we note that we have the decomposition  2\_n\^[1/2]{}ł{\_n() - \_n()} = \_n\^[-1/2]{} ł{\_1(T)+2\_2(T)+\_3(T)+\_4(T) }. For , we consider the two terms and . By independence of with the other processes we deduce that the conditional covariance term between those two processes is null. We use this fact along with the marginal convergences obtained in Lemma   and Lemma   to obtain the convergence in law conditioned on  \_[n,(i)]{}\^[-1/2]{} ł{M\_[3,(i)]{}(T)+M\_[4,(i)]{}(T) } ł(0,ł(  ł( + ) &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; +  )), where . Now, by Slutsky’s lemma, Lemma   and Lemma   we also have the -stable convergence in distribution Finally, by application of Proposition   with sub--field since is -measurable, we deduce the joint -stable convergence of hence the convergence of toward a mixed normal distribution of random variance . Finally, as blocks are non overlapping, we deduce that for any , for any the martingales and are orthogonal so that we have automatically the joint convergence of to a mixed normal with block diagonal random variance matrix whose submatrices are , and we are done.  Finally, we derive a central limit theorem for to the limit , and as a byproduct Theorem   (and Theorem  ).  We have -stably in law that \_n\^[1/2]{}ł{\_n-\_0 }ł(0,ł(  V\_[(1)]{}\^[’]{} &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; V\_[(2)]{}\^[’]{} &amp; 0 &amp;\ &amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 0&amp;&amp;&amp;V\_[(B)]{}\^[’]{}  )), where for , is the two dimensional matrix defined by V\_[(i)]{}\^[’]{} := ł(  a\_0ł( + ) &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; 2a\_0\^[4]{} + [cum]{.nodecor}\_4 \  ). In particular, Theorem   (and Theorem  ) hold.  First, note that we can easily extend Lemma   to get a central limit theorem at the point for by a generalization of Slutsky’s Lemma for stably convergent sequences (see e.g. Theorem 3.18 (b) in ), where now the submatrices in the asymptotic variance of the mixed normal distribution have the form  V\_[(i)]{} = ł(  ł(+ ) &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; +\  ). To derive the CLT for the -dimensional estimator , we follow the standard procedure and expand the score function around . Thus, starting from the first order conditions on the score functions, we have  0 = \_nł(\_n ) = \_n(\_0) + \_n\^[-1/2]{} \_n(\_n)\_n\^[1/2]{}(\_n - \_0),   for some , and where is the block diagonal matrix with submatrices , and for , is the scaled Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood field on block , defined as in ( ) adapted to the time interval . In the same way, we define as the block diagonal matrix whose subcomponents are where \_[(i)]{}(\_[0,(i)]{}) := ł(  &amp; 0\ 0 &amp;  ), and . We can rewrite ( ) as (\_0)\^[-1]{}\_n(\_n)\_n\^[1/2]{}(\_n - \_0) = - (\_0)\^[-1]{} \_n\^[1/2]{}ł{\_nł(\_0) -\_nł(\_0 ) } + \_n\^[1/2]{} \_n(\_0).   Note that, again, by a direct adaptation of (38) and (40) in (pp. 247-248) to the case of an irregular grid with and on the interval we automatically get that each so that is negligible. Now, is consistent by application of Theorem   to each on block . Therefore, , and by virtue of Lemma   applied to each submatrix , we conclude on the one hand that where is the identity matrix, and on the other hand by Slutsky’s Lemma and the stable CLT for that the left-hand side of ( ) tends -stably in law to a mixed normal distribution of block diagonal random variance matrix with submatrices of the form  ł(  &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; 4a\_0\^8\  ) &amp;&amp; ł(  ł(+ ) &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; +\  )\ &amp;=&amp; ł(  a\_0ł( + ) &amp; 0\ 0 &amp; 2a\_0\^[4]{} + [cum]{.nodecor}\_4 \  )\ &amp;=&amp;V\_[(i)]{}\^[’]{}, and thus we have shown the CLT for . Now to get Theorem  , it is sufficient to notice that where has the form and from here we easily conclude that the left-hand side of ( ) admits a CLT with the claimed asymptotic variance. Finally Theorem   is a particular case of Theorem  .">

We further define the estimate on the th block and we aggregate the local estimates to define the adapted version of as We follow the same line of reasoning as in the proof of Theorem 4 (p. 1530, ). Accordingly, we just need to show an adapted version of Theorem 3 (p. 1492). Theorem   will then follow from Lemma 1 (p. 1523) and Proposition  .

The proof for ( ) can adapt directly from the cross-term part in the proof of Theorem 3 (p. 1528, ). Indeed, on each block we have the convergence discussed on p. 1525, and it is clear that as the block terms are uncorrelated to each other conditioned on , we obtain the convergence of the vector block estimates, with correlation limit between two different block terms equal to 0.  We aim to show now ( ). In view of (A.3) on p. 1528 in , we have where and and is due to end-effects. We have that and for some normally distributed variables and from the proof on p. 1529 in .

Thus we can get rid of the terms for which is contained into because \_[i J\_B]{} AVAR\_[ ]{}\^[(RK,c\_i\^\*,2)]{} |J\_B| \_B T\^[1/2]{}a\_0 \^3 0, and similarly g(1) a\_0 T\^[1/2]{}\_[i J\_B]{} \_[\_[i-1]{}]{}\^[\_i]{} \_u\^3 du 0. Thus, the proposition will be proved if we show \_[i J\_B]{}[AVAR\_[ ]{}\^[(RK,c\_i\^\*,2)]{}]{} - g (1) a\_0 T\^[1/2]{}\_[i J\_B]{} \_[T\_[i-1]{}]{}\^[T\_i]{} \_u\^3 du 0.  As the continuous part of is assumed to be an Itô process with bounded components, some calculation shows that for any , and uniformly in we have the following expansion \_[\_[i-1]{}]{}\^[\_i]{}[\_u\^p du]{} = \_[T\_[i-1]{}]{}\^p\_B+ O\_[\^q]{}(\_B\^[3/2]{}), where , means that is bounded. Thus, using again ( ), we also obtain the expansions , , and to get finally the estimate AVAR\_[ ]{}\^[(RK,c\_i\^\*,2)]{} = g(1) a\_0 T\^[1/2]{} \_[T\_[i-1]{}]{}\^[T\_i]{} \_u\^3 du + O\_[\^q]{}(\_B\^[3/2]{}) uniformly in . At this stage we have thus proved that \_[i J\_B]{}[AVAR\_[ ]{}\^[(RK,c\_i\^\*,2)]{}]{} - g(1) a\_0 T\^[1/2]{}\_[i J\_B]{} \_[T\_[i-1]{}]{}\^[T\_i]{} \_u\^3 du = O\_[\^q]{}(\_B\^[1/2]{}). To get the almost sure convergence to 0, we define as the left hand side of the previous equality and note that for any . This gives us that and so , which completes the proof.">
