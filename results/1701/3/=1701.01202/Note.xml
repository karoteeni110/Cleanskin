<outline text="Introduction" _note="Ringel introduced the Hall algebra of a finite dimensional algebra over a finite field. By the works of Ringel and Green , the twisted Hall algebra, called the Ringel–Hall algebra, of a finite dimensional hereditary algebra provides a realization of the positive (negative) part of the corresponding quantum group. In order to obtain a Hall algebra description of the entire quantum group, one considers the Hall algebras of triangulated categories (for example, , , ). In , Xiao gave a realization of the whole quantum group by constructing the Drinfeld double of the extended Ringel–Hall algebra of any hereditary algebra.  In 2013, Bridgeland considered the Hall algebra of 2-cyclic complexes of projective modules over a finite dimensional hereditary algebra , and achieved an algebra, called the (reduced) Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of , by taking some localization and reduction. He proved that there is an algebra embedding from the Ringel–Hall algebra of to its Bridgeland’s Hall algebra. Moreover, the quantum group associated with A can be embedded into the reduced Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of . This provides a realization of the full quantum group by Hall algebras. In , Bridgeland stated without proof that the Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of each finite dimensional hereditary algebra is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of its extended Ringel–Hall algebra. Later on, Yanagida proved this statement in . With the purpose of generalizing Bridgeland’s construction to a bigger class of exact categories, Gorsky defined the so-called semi-derived Hall algebra of the category of bounded complexes of for each exact category satisfying certain finiteness conditions. In particular, if every object in has finite projective resolution, he gave a similar construction to the category of 2-cyclic complexes of . Recently, inspired by the works of Bridgeland and Gorsky, Lu and Peng have generalized Bridgeland’s construction to any hereditary abelian category which may not have enough projectives, and defined an algebra for the category of 2-cyclic complexes of , called the modified Ringel–Hall algebra of . They also proved that the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double Hall algebra of .  The key step in the proof that the Bridgeland’s Hall algebra or modified Ringel–Hall algebra of a hereditary abelian category is isomorphic to its Drinfeld double Hall algebra is to check the (Drinfeld) commutator relations. The method used in is to make the summations on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the commutator relations symmetric by some analysis of the structure of the category of 2-cyclic complexes of projectives in , as well as some complicated calculations. It seems that the process of the proof is not too intuitive. While Lu and Peng gave a characterization of some coefficients in the commutator relations by introducing two sets, and obtained the proof by means of the coincidence of the cardinalities of these two sets. Nevertheless, their characterization is a bit complicated. In this note we use the associativity formula of Hall algebras to give a more intuitive and simpler proof that the Bridgeland’s Hall algebra of is isomorphic to its Drinfeld double Hall algebra. Similarly, based on , we give a simplification of the key step in the proof of Theorem 4.11 in . Explicitly, we prove the commutator relations therein by using the associativity formula of Hall algebras rather than Lemma 4.10 in .  Let us fix some notations used throughout the paper. is always a finite field with elements and set . is always a finitary hereditary abelian -category with enough projectives unless otherwise stated, we also assume that the image of in the Grothendieck group is nonzero for any nonzero object in (cf. ).

In this note, we explicitly work out the coefficients in the summation via Hall numbers. While, Lu and Peng introduced orbit sets and express the coefficients by . For the conclusive part, we are reduced to use the associativity formula of Hall algebras, and Lu and Peng introduced once more two sets and give a characterization of the cardinalities of these sets (), then they are reduced to the equality of the cardinalities of these two sets. In some sense, we avoid computing the cardinalities of the sets defined by Lu and Peng, this work seems to be equivalent to the proof of the associativity of Hall algebras. However, the advantage of their proof is that we have better understanding of the essence of the coefficients in the commutator relation .">
