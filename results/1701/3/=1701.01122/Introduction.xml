    <abstract>We investigate the connection between the star formation rate (SFR) of
galaxies and their central black hole accretion rate (BHAR) using the
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We find, in striking concurrence
with recent observational studies, that the –BHAR relation for an AGN
selected sample produces a relatively flat trend, whilst the –SFR
relation for a SFR selected sample yields an approximately linear trend.
These trends remain consistent with their instantaneous equivalents even
when both SFR and BHAR are time-averaged over a period of 100 Myr. There
is no universal relationship between the two growth rates. Instead, SFR
and BHAR evolve through distinct paths that depend strongly on the mass
of the host dark matter halo. The galaxies hosted by haloes of mass grow
steadily, yet black holes (BHs) in these systems hardly grow, yielding a
lack of correlation between SFR and BHAR. As haloes grow through the
mass range BHs undergo a rapid phase of non-linear growth. These systems
yield a highly non-linear correlation between the SFR and BHAR, which
are non-causally connected via the mass of the host halo. In massive
haloes ( ) both SFR and BHAR decline on average with a roughly constant
scaling of SFR/BHAR . Given the complexity of the full SFR–BHAR plane
built from multiple behaviours, and from the large dynamic range of
BHARs, we find the primary driver of the different observed trends in
the –BHAR and –SFR relationships are due to sampling considerably
different regions of this plane. </abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="Substantial effort has been dedicated both observationally and theoretically to identifying the link between the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes (BHs). However, the nature of this relationship remains poorly understood. Indirect evidence of a causal connection has been suggested empirically based on the INTEGRATED properties of galaxies and their BH counterparts. For example, galaxy bulge mass () and the mass of the central BH () exhibit a tight, approximately linear correlation for bulge masses in excess of . However, at lower bulge mass, a steeper trend has been advocated . Additionally, the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR) densities broadly trace one another through time .  A simple interpretation for these global relationships is that the growth rates that build these properties (i.e. the SFR of the galaxy and accretion rate of the BH) are proportional throughout their evolution, thus growing the two components in concert. More complex evolutionary scenarios have also been proposed. For example, a simple time-averaged relationship built from a common fuel reservoir of cold gas , a rapid build up of galaxy and BH mass via merger induced starburst/quasar activity or a mutual dependence on the mass or potential of the dark matter halo . In these scenarios the SFR and BHAR do not necessarily trace each other directly and the observed correlations may only appear in massive galaxies due to an averaging of very different histories. Furthermore, and go as far as to suggest there is no causal connection of any kind, with correlations only appearing as result of a random walk.  To test these scenarios, numerous observational studies have attempted to identify a direct link between the intrinsic growth rates of galaxies and their central BHs. Studies that investigate the mean SFR () as a function of BHAR consistently find no evidence for a correlation for moderate-luminosity sources . For high-luminosity sources (&amp;gt;  erg s) however, there has been significant disagreement as to if this relation becomes positively correlated , negatively correlated or continues to remain uncorrelated . These disparities between various works at the high-luminosity end are likely due to small number statistics and sample variance , and indeed, recent studies using large sample sizes confirm the extension of a flat trend to higher luminosities .  A flat trend for the –BHAR relation could potentially be interpreted as revealing an absence of a connection between SFR and BHAR. However, studies that have investigated the mean BHAR () as a function of SFR consistently find a POSITIVE relationship . Within the paradigm of a linear – relation due to a universal co-evolution of BH and galaxy growth, both approaches are expected to produce a consistent, similarly linear result (see   for a derivation of why this is). proposes a potential solution, suggesting that SFR and BHAR are connected ON AVERAGE over a period of 100 Myr, with a linear scaling. This relationship disappears when measured instantaneously owing to the rapid variability timescale of AGN, with respect to that of galactic star formation.  From a theoretical perspective, many simulations have focussed on the growth of BHs in galaxy mergers . Whilst both star formation and BH accretion are typically enhanced during the merger proper, the extent of the connection between SFR and BHAR pre- and post-merger event remains unclear. demonstrate through the use of a semi-analytical model that the observed correlations between galaxies and their central BHs can be reproduced when BH growth occurs only during merger induced starbursts. This could explain the lack of a correlation between growth rates in low-luminosity systems whilst allowing for mutual enhancement during the merger events themselves. investigate the impact of various feedback models on the SFR–BHAR parameter space in a set of equal mass merger simulations. They find a complex evolution for individual systems, even when averaged over 20 Myrs. Any correlation found is strongly dependant on the feedback model chosen, with the post-merger phase showing the strongest evidence for a positive connection. Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical merger suite, find BHAR and galaxy-wide SFR to be typically temporally uncorrelated. They suggest in that the observed discrepancy between the –BHAR and –SFR relations seen observationally are a result of sampling two different projections of the full bi-variate SFR–BHAR distribution whose build up is constructed from different behaviours between SFR and BHAR before, during and after the merger event.  It is now possible to extend these investigations to within a full cosmological context. Using the semi-analytical code , find a negative SFR–AGN luminosity correlation at low AGN luminosities, this then transitions to a strong positive correlation at high AGN luminosities. In the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation , find a single trend in the SFR–BHAR relationship embedded in a large scatter, particularly in BHAR. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have the advantage of probing the entire galaxy population within a self consistent variety of environments with a diverse range of accretion and merger histories. Here we investigate to what extent galaxy and BH growth rates are connected within the [^1] [^2] simulation. Adopting physical prescriptions for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, BH accretion, BH mergers and both stellar and AGN feedback, reproduces many observed properties of galaxies, BHs and the intergalacic medium with unprecedented fidelity .  The paper is organised as follows. In   we provide a brief overview of the simulation suite, including the subgrid model prescription and simulation output. The results are presented in  . We examine the predictions of the –BHAR relationship for an AGN selected sample and the –SFR relationship for a SFR selected sample in  , finding good agreement to recent observational findings. To investigate why these trends might be different, we explore the effect of time-averaging each growth rate and examine potential sampling biases in  .   examines the influence of the host dark matter halo on both SFR and BHAR, finding that each exhibits a strong connection. Finally in  , we discuss the changing relationship between SFR and BHAR as the halo grows and in  , we present our conclusions.
