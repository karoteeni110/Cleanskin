<outline text="Discussion" _note="Throughout this investigation we have consistently found no evidence supporting a simple underlying relationship between the rate of a galaxy’s star formation and the accretion rate of its central BH. Instead, a mutual dependence of each property upon the mass of the host halo yields a more complex connection. It is interesting to examine, then, how the relation between the SFR and BHAR evolves for individual objects. In the following discussion, we will provide a physical interpretation based on the (hereafter B16) model for BH growth . However, we stress the simulation results are themselves independent of any physical interpretation.    equates the median trends of the SFR and BHAR histories shown in  . This specifies the 100 Myr average SFR as a function of the 100 Myr average BHAR in equal spacings of halo mass. Three distinct trends between SFR and BHAR emerge as the halo evolves: the STELLAR FEEDBACK REGULATED phase (shaded blue), the NON-LINEAR BH GROWTH phase (shaded green) and the AGN FEEDBACK REGULATED phase (shaded red).  REGION A - THE STELLAR FEEDBACK REGULATED PHASE: From the time of their seeding until they are hosted by haloes of mass the BH accretion rates are negligible (on average). By contrast, SFRs increase steadily with halo mass. This behaviour produces the uncorrelated (yet causally connected) vertical trend in region A, creating an imbalance of growth within these systems. As a result, BHs remain close to their seed mass whilst the halo/galaxy continues to grow around them (see the low-mass region of  ).  B16 interpret galaxies in this regime as being in a state of regulatory equilibrium. Energy injected by stars heats the ISM within the stellar vicinity, ejecting it, and causing it to rise buoyantly in the halo. This in turn creates an outflow of material balancing the freshly sourced fuel from the cosmic web, and as such prevents large gas densities from building up within the inner regions of these low-mass galaxies. Such low densities, coupled with the relatively low mass BHs living within these galaxies (BHAR ), ensures that BHs fail to grow substantially.  REGION B - THE NON-LINEAR BH GROWTH PHASE: Both galaxies and BHs grow through the halo mass range . However, whereas the SFRs continue to increase steadily with increasing halo mass, BHs rapidly transition to a non-linear phase of growth. This creates a highly non-linear INDIRECT correlation between SFR and BHAR, connected through the host halo mass.  The physical interpretation posited by B16 is that haloes that grow to the transition mass, , have become sufficiently massive to stall the regulatory outflow. Due to (what is now) the halos’ hot coronae, heated gas ejected by stellar feedback loses the capability to rise buoyantly and therefore returns to the galaxy centre. Densities in the central regions of the galaxy are no longer kept low and a to non-linear BH growth is triggered.  REGION C - THE AGN FEEDBACK REGULATED PHASE: For haloes with masses above SFRs and BHARs both decline on average, correlated with an approximately linear trend (compare to green dashed line, see also bottom panel of  ).  B16 argue that BHs in these haloes have become sufficiently massive (through their rapid non-linear growth) to efficiently regulate the gas inflow onto the galaxy themselves via AGN feedback. This again creates an equilibrium state, for which a fluctuating low level of (specific) BH accretion is maintained, keeping the outer halo hot and evaporating much of the new cold material trying to enter the system from the intergalactic medium.  Galaxies and their central BHs within the simulation transition through multiple stages of growth as their host dark matter halo evolves, creating three distinct behaviours between SFR and BHAR. This is a stark contrast to a simple model where SFR and BHAR correlate globally via a linear relation, on average and for all halo masses. Whilst the underlying trend is only revealed when each growth rate is time-averaged (given the inherent noise of instantaneous growth rates), we only find an approximately linear correlation for the most massive systems ( ).  In this paper we have emphasised the role of the halo and how its interaction with both SFR and BHAR shapes the growth rate relationship. However, additional factors may also contribute to the form this relationship takes. For example, find using a suite of isolated merger simulations at fixed halo mass, that alternate behaviours between SFR and BHAR before, during and after the merger proper collectively contribute to form a complex two-dimensional plane. Additionally, reveal the particular importance differing merger histories can have on significantly altering the growth rate history of both that of the galaxy and the central BH. However, the global influence of mergers upon galaxy and BH growth rates in a full cosmological context remains open for debate, and will be the subject of a future paper.">
