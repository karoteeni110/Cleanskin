<outline text="Simulations &amp;amp; Subgrid model" _note="is a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations comprising a range of periodic volumes, numerical resolutions and physical models. The simulations are run using a substantially modified version of the N-body TreePM smoothed particle hydrodynamics code -3 , referred to as . For this study we focus on the largest run (Ref-L0100N1504), a cubic periodic volume of 100 comoving megaparsecs (cMpc) on each side, containing dark matter particles of mass  and an equal number of baryonic particles with an initial mass of  . The subgrid parameters are those of the reference () model, described fully by . Cosmological parameters are those inferred by , namely: , , , and .">
  <outline text="Subgrid model" _note="Processes operating below the numerical resolution of the simulation are treated as , implemented as a series of physical models. A detailed description of the full subgrid prescription is given by , with consideration to their influence on the reference model given by . Here we give only a brief overview:  RADIATIVE COOLING AND PHOTO-IONISATION HEATING is implemented as per , tracing 11 elements in the presence of the cosmic microwave background and the evolving, spatially uniform UV/X-ray background of .  STAR FORMATION is implemented as a pressure dependent relation that reproduces the Kennicutt-Schmidt law described by . The subsequent STELLAR MASS LOSS via winds of massive stars and supernovae is computed as per .  STELLAR FEEDBACK is injected thermally and stochastically following the method of .  BH SEEDING follows the prescription first introduced by , whereby BHs are introduced as collisionless sink particles placed in the centres of dark matter haloes more massive than , which do not already contain one. BHs enter the simulation with a seed mass and subsequently grow via accretion of surrounding gas or mergers with other BHs.  BHS GROW VIA ACCRETION of nearby material at a rate estimated from the modified Bondi-Hoyle formalism introduced in . In short, the model is an extension of the spherically symmetric case of accounting now for the circularisation velocity of the surrounding gas, capped at the Eddington limit. Contrary to , we do not use an additional boost factor ().  AGN FEEDBACK is implemented as a single mode, where it is injected thermally and stochastically into the surrounding interstellar medium as per . Feedback is performed assuming a single efficiency, independent of halo mass and accretion rate.  As described by , the subgrid model parameters are calibrated to reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes and normalisation of the – relation at .">

    <outline text="Halo and galaxy identification" _note="Outputs are stored as 29 between redshifts and at which the complete state of every particle is recorded. In addition, 400 data-lite are produced, with a typical temporal separation of 40-60 Myr. Bound structures are identified in post processing. First, dark matter haloes are identified using the (FOF) algorithm with linking length of times the mean interparticle separation . Then, bound substructures (or ) within these haloes are identified with the program applied to the full particle distribution (dark matter, gas, stars and BHs). We associate the baryonic component of each subhalo with a galaxy, defined to be the CENTRAL galaxy if it hosts the particle with the minimum gravitational potential and the remainder being classified as SATELLITES.  Halo mass, , is defined as the total mass enclosed within , the radius at which the mean enclosed density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe. Galaxy mass, , is defined at the total stellar content belonging to a subhalo within a 30 pkpc spherical aperture as per .">

    <outline text="Constructing histories of individual galaxies" _note="In order to accurately trace the evolution of individual galaxies and their central BH for the analysis in  , we require histories of a higher temporal resolution than is provided by the snipshot output. To do this, we follow galaxies and their central BH through cosmic time. As a galaxy descendant may have multiple progenitors, we trace the progenitor galaxy that is hosted along the of the merger tree as defined by , the branch containing the greatest total mass along its history.  BHARs are recorded at each timestep with a typical spacing of  yr, yielding an rate. These can then be time-averaged over longer durations. Quoted SFRs are taken from the snapshot output, where they are computed based on the current star forming state of the gas contained within the galaxy. Time-averaged SFR histories are constructed from the stellar particles born within the main progenitor that reside in the galaxy at the present day. As these particles store both their birth time and initial mass, collectively they create a robust history of star formation for that galaxy. However, as these histories are sensitive in their resolution to the number of particles sampled, only galaxies containing more than 200 particles ( ) are considered for this study.    shows an example history of an individual galaxy’s SFR (top panel) and accretion rate of the central BH (bottom panel) through cosmic time taken from the methods described above. We show each growth rate time-averaged over 5 Myr (blue and green lines) and 100 Myr (red and black lines) to highlight the large difference in variability scatter between the two timescales. This is particularly severe for BHAR, where values recorded over short timescales do not return a good approximation of the long term average rate, differing in value by as much as 4 dex. We have adopted 100 Myr as our long averaging duration as it reflects an estimate of the effective timescale for empirical indicators of star formation using the far-infrared . Although there are similar features between SFR and BHAR through time for this individual case (for example a common peak at a lookback time of 12 Gyr), globally the two histories are quite different.">

  <outline text="The – relation" _note="  shows the – relation for central galaxies at . We have plotted as a function of halo mass rather than bulge or total stellar mass due to the crucial connection that has with both SFR and BHAR (see   onwards). We note that the – relation also follows the same behaviour and throughout this description and can be interchanged. The overlaid two dimensional bins are for the continued investigation in  , where they are fully described.  The empirical relationship between BH mass and that of the classical bulge is well described by a single power law at high mass . Indeed, one of the calibration parameters of the simulation is to match the normalisation of this relationship. However, whereas traditionally this trend has been linearly extrapolated to lower-mass systems, predicts a steepening of the trend. As a consequence, the relation between BH mass and the mass of the host galaxy or halo is not well described by a single power law. Interestingly, a steeper slope at intermediate masses is supported by recent observations of bulge (or pseudobulge) systems . When total stellar mass is considered as the independent variable, predict Seyfert-like systems yield and alternate – relationship to previously measured early-type systems. However, each trend is consistent with a linear relation, with Seyfert-like systems harbouring a lower normalisation.  For , BHs in massive systems ( ) follow an approximately linear trend with halo mass (compare to the black dashed black line in  ), but those hosted by haloes with mass follow a much steeper relation and those in the lowest mass systems ( ) plateau at the seed BH mass.   argue that multiple physical processes drive the relation between and . In low (high) mass systems stellar (AGN) feedback regulates the baryonic inflow to the galaxy, suppressing BH (continued stellar) growth. There is a critical transition halo mass ( , hereafter ) separating these two regulatory regimes. Within haloes, neither feedback process is dominant, and as a result BHs grow at a highly non-linear rate. These phases create the flat, supra-linear and linear regimes of BH growth seen in the integrated quantities of   and have important consequences for the galaxy and BH growth rates investigated throughout this study.">

  <outline text="Absolute calibration of SFRs" _note="When comparing to the observed cosmic SFR density, found an almost constant -0.2 dex offset for redshifts . There is however continued uncertainty as to the absolute calibration of SFR indicators on which these observations rely. For example, find upon revisiting this calibration with the addition of WISE photometry to the full SDSS spectroscopic galaxy sample that the SFRs of local galaxies along the main-sequence are systematically lower than previously estimated by  dex, yielding good agreement with the prediction .  As the observational datasets compared to in   utilise an earlier calibration, we REDUCE all observed SFRs by 0.2 dex. The magnitude of this recalibration is shown as a red arrow in  . This serves to remove the known global systematic offset, making it simpler to focus on the trends with BHAR that are the topic of this paper.">
