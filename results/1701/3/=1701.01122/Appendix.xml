<outline text="Predictions from the integrated quantities" _note="The major motivation for linking the growth of galaxies to the growth of their central BH has arisen empirically from the strong correlations seen in their integrated properties (the primary example being the tight – relation). We therefore require an evolutionary model that suitably fits this end point. In the simplest case, where BHs and their host galaxy grow in concert (or co-evolve), the relational form between their growth rates can be easily predicted. Given a functional form of the – relation described via  where is the gradient of the slope and is the intercept, the predicted relation between the growth rates is simply found by differentiating with respect to time, i.e,  In the trivial case where (i.e, a linear relation) this reduces to  Within this scenario, growth rates are directly proportional to one another scaled by the intercept, , of the – relation. Therefore, if the functional form between the growth rates is described via  where again and are the slope and intercept values, we would expect and in the case where .  Throughout this study we will test the hypothesis that there exists a broadly linear co-evolution between galaxies and their central BHs, a plausible scenario fitting the empirical – relation. We refer throughout to as the gradient of the slope between the integrated properties (–) and to as the slope between each growth rate (–), both in log space.">
