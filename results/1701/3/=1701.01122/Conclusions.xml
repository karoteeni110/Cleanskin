<outline text="Conclusions" _note="We have investigated the relationship between the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) of the central black hole (BH) using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Our main conclusions are as follows:  We compared predictions to two recent observational studies in  . The simulation reproduces both the flat trend of the mean SFR () as a function of BHAR found in the AGN selected study of and the approximately linear trend of the mean BHAR () as a function of SFR found in the SFR selected study of .  There is a moderate difference in the –BHAR relationship when time-averaging each growth rate over a 100 Myr period for an AGN selected study ( ). However, this change was not found to be sufficient as to revert the trend to an underlying linear relationship as has been proposed by previous theoretical studies.  Examining the complete SFR–BHAR plane in  , we found no evidence for a simple universal global relationship between the two instantaneous growth rates. The difference between the trends found for the –BHAR and –SFR relations from AGN and SFR selections respectively, is due to sampling different regions of this complex plane. The complexity of this plane results from both the rate of galactic star formation and the accretion rate of the central BH holding an evolving connection to the host dark matter halo ( ).  For a discrete redshift, the characteristic SFR of a halo increases smoothly with increasing halo mass ( ). BHs in haloes of mass accrete at a rate (). They then transition through haloes of mass to a rate () in haloes of mass . However, the scatter in the BHAR at fixed halo mass is very large (up to  dex). Galaxies with SFRs far below the characteristic SFR all contain massive BHs ( ).  The median evolutionary trend for a galaxy’s SFR and the accretion rate of its central BH, averaged over 100 Myr, are insensitive to the final properties of the system ( ). By equating these trends together we found that the 100 Myr average SFR as a function of the 100 Myr average BHAR can be split into three regimes, separated by the halo mass ( ). BHs hosted by haloes below the characteristic transition mass, , fail to grow effectively, yet the galaxy continues to grow with the halo. Once the halo reaches there is a non-linear of BH growth that rapidly builds the mass of the BH. In the most massive haloes ( &amp;gt; ) both SFR and BHAR decline on average, with a roughly constant scaling of SFR/BHAR .">
