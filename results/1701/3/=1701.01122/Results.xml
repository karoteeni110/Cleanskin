  <outline text="Comparison to observations" _note="   We begin by comparing the predicted relationship between galaxy and BH growth rates to two recent observational studies using different selection criteria. Firstly, we explore the versus BHAR relation for the AGN SELECTED sample presented by . Secondly, we explore the versus SFR relation for the SFR SELECTED sample presented by . Together they represent two of the largest sample sizes of their respective selection techniques, spanning multiple epochs. Large sample sizes such as these are key in overcoming the uncertainties inherent to low number statistics and in mitigating the potential redshift evolution biases that could be misinterpreted as an underlying trend.  As mentioned in  , SFRs obtained via FIR tracers most likely probe the recent star formation history of a galaxy, rather than an instantaneous value. Therefore the comparative SFRs of galaxies used in the analysis of   are the time-averaged rate over the 100 Myr preceding the instantaneous BHAR measurement. However, when performing the equivalent analysis using the instantaneous values of SFR at the time of the BHAR measurement we find no difference in the result, attesting to the stability of star formation as a process.">

To compare to the data we convert their quoted bolometric AGN luminosities (derived from X-ray luminosities) to BHARs via  where is the speed of light and is the radiative efficiency of the accretion disk, which is assumed to be 0.1 . To emulate the sample selection of this study, we choose galaxies based on a redshift independent detection limit of   yr, corresponding to  erg s according to   and is equivalent to  erg s using the conversion methods outlined in Section 3.2 of .  The results are presented in  , showing the MEAN SFR as a function of BHAR, represented by a solid black line. We see that for each redshift range the gradient of the relation remains shallow (note the same dynamic range is used for both axes), ranging in values (see  ) and is in striking agreement with the relation reported by . This is considerably flatter than one would predict for a linear – relation from a co-evolution of growth, which we represent as a dashed green line[^1] (see  ). The dynamic range of SFRs is modest, with a scatter of  dex for all redshifts. The normalisations of in the three lowest redshift ranges () are in good agreement with the observational estimates (within  dex). However, the values in the highest redshift range () are systematically under predicted by  dex over and above the recalibration discussed in  . We note that this highest bin is potentially subject to the largest systematic over estimate ( dex) due to the large fraction (%) of undetected FIR sources (included as upper limits) in the observations .

    <outline text="BHAR as a function of SFR for a SFR selected sample" _note="The study of consists of star-forming galaxies detected out to . The selection limits in SFR are redshift dependent, corresponding to 0.2, 1.0, 3.0, 8.0 and 25.0 for the five redshift ranges covered by this study from low to high respectively. We note that the data points from are segregated also in stellar mass, however for simplicity we make no such distinction.  The comparison is shown in  , showing the MEAN BHAR as a function of SFR as the solid black line. Again, shows a good consistency with the observational measurements (shown in red), only over predicting in the lowest redshift range (). However, mentions that the limited co-moving volume of this study at low redshift could potentially exclude the most luminous sources. The behaviour of the –SFR relation is quite different from the –BHAR relation seen in  , adhering much closer to a linear trend. We see, uniformly, gradients close to unity (, see  ) in good agreement with the linear – relation expected for a co-evolution of growth, shown as a dashed green line (note again the same dynamic range is used for both axes). An additional difference is the spread of values in the minimisation axis (for this figure). The distribution of SFRs in   span a relatively narrow dynamic range, whereas here, BHARs vary as much as  dex in the percentile region. In fact, the dynamic range of BHARs is so large that the small fraction of galaxies whose values dominate the mean are able to pull it outside this percentile range entirely in some places, suggesting the median to be a more suitable statistic to measure this trend.  Overall the agreement between and the observations is excellent, particularly given that no information regarding this relation was considered during the calibration procedure. The difference in behaviour found empirically via alternate selection criteria is well reproduced by the simulation. We find, consistent with the model and findings by , that –BHAR for an AGN selected sample exhibits a relatively flat trend (), whilst that of with respect to SFR for a SFR selected sample is substantially steeper and close to unity (). However, within the paradigm of a linear – relation created through co-evolution of growth these results are both predicted to be linear (i.e, for both, see  ). Therefore either the underlying relationship itself is fundamentally non-linear, or a fuller understanding of the two processes is required. In the next section we continue to examine potential reasons as to the cause of this difference.">

  <outline text="Understanding the BHAR-SFR relationship" _note="In this section we explore two potential reasons why the –BHAR and –SFR trends are not each consistent with a linear relationship. We examine the hypothesis that (1) growth rates have an underlying linear connection only on average, which is masked when the unstable growth rate is observed instantaneously and (2) how selection biases due to the inability to probe the complete SFR–BHAR plane may play a role.">
    <outline text="A time-averaged SFR–BHAR connection" _note=" suggested that an underlying correlation held between a stable (galactic star formation) and unstable (BH accretion) process ON AVERAGE could be washed out if the unstable property is measured instantaneously. That is to say, if one could observe X-ray luminosities of AGN sources over prolonged periods, the underlying relationship between the two properties would begin to emerge. Indeed, with a simple model that assumes SFR and BHAR are connected on average with a linear scaling over a period of 100 Myr, reproduce the empirical behaviours of both the –BHAR and –SFR relationships whilst retaining a scenario consistent with a linear co-evolution between galaxies and their central BHs. While it is not possible to test observationally due to the length of these timescales, we are able to test this hypothesis using the simulation.    is similar to the upper left panel of  . The region in blue, with the black solid line, shows the original analysis of the –BHAR relation for the redshift range using instantaneous BHARs and SFRs that are time-averaged 100 Myr before the BH event. Overlaid in red, with the mean represented by a dashed line, is the same selection of galaxies (i.e, instantaneous ) with each growth rate now time-averaged over 100 Myr. Interestingly, although the high BHARs shift systematically to lower values on average[^1], both the dynamic range and slope of the mean remain broadly consistent with their instantaneous equivalents (, see  ). This behaviour remains for each redshift range explored by (see  ). An alternate approach is to select galaxies in excess of on average (rather than instantaneously as done above) or indeed to prolong the averaging timescale to  Myrs. However in each case, and for all redshift intervals, the gradient values remain well below unity (). This leads us to conclude that the average galaxy and BH growth rates for an AGN selected sample do not harbour an underlying global linear relationship.  [^1]: The shift (0.5 dex) to lower values in BHAR when averaging over     100 Myr arises due to the most luminous commonly residing in peaks     of the accretion rate history.">

    <outline text="Sampling different regions of the entire SFR-BHAR plane" _note="As observational surveys are subject to various flux limitations, they can only sample particular regions of the full SFR–BHAR plane. If the global underlying relation is linear, and each property exhibits a moderate scatter, each sub sample should also return a linear result. However, as the findings of previous sections do not to support an underlying linear relation, and because the scatter is large, it is important to investigate the effect of this sampling.    shows the complete SFR–BHAR plane for all central galaxies at . In order to eliminate any potential bias incurred via redshift evolution in either growth rate we consider a discrete redshift rather than the continuous ranges of  . Each data point represents the INSTANTANEOUS state of a single galaxy and its central BH, coloured by the halo mass. Values that are below  for and  for are treated as and are clipped to these values. The approximate flux limit of the AGN selected sample by is shown as a solid vertical line and the approximate flux limit of the SFR selected sample by is shown as a horizontal solid line.  It is further apparent that the global relationship between SFR and BHAR is not simply linear (reference with the dashed green line). Instead, a complicated relationship arises due to an amalgamation of three distinct behaviours of BH growth dependent on the mass of the host dark matter halo (see next section). It is therefore crucial to consider the particular region sampled before arriving at a particular conclusion. AGN selected samples, such as that of , currently probe a relatively limited region at the tip of the SFR–BHAR plane. With the exception of a few sources with rates , galaxies satisfying this selection criteria are distributed over a relatively narrow range of SFRs. As such, each bin of BHAR yields a very similar value of , creating an approximately flat trend. SFR selected samples, such as that of , sample a not too dissimilar distribution of SFRs (this time due to the flux limit), however, the distribution of BHARs is much wider. This in turn yields a steeper relation. We note, that whilst the mean SFR provides a good proxy of the median SFR for an AGN selected study (compare columns 3 and 6 of  ), the mean BHAR for a SFR selected study is not a good proxy of the median value due to the distribution of BHARs having such a large scatter (compare columns 8 and 10 of  ). Although only the results from have been shown here, when investigated we find the results remain true independent of redshift.  We therefore conclude that the different behaviour found for the –BHAR and –SFR relations recovered by observational studies is due to sampling considerably different regions of the full (not universally linear) SFR–BHAR plane. We now continue to investigate the nature of this relationship in the simulation and its evolution through time.">

  <outline text="The connection to the host dark matter halo" _note="The relationship between SFR and BHAR seen in   is complicated, seemingly not adhering to a simple universal trend. However, there is evidence that each property has a link with the mass of the host dark matter halo, highlighted in the change of the data point colours, which transition smoothly from blue to red with increasing SFR, and systematically shift rightward in BHAR (with a large scatter) at high halo mass.  To examine this in more depth we sub categorize the central galaxies into five continuous ranges of halo mass, showing the growth rates in  . Here we find, in fact, that the global make up of the SFR–BHAR plane in   is resolved into a collection of two dimensional strips, wide in their dynamic range of BHAR ( dex) yet generally much more compact in their SFR ( dex). Each strip hosts a characteristic value of SFR (defined as the mode of the distribution, shown as a horizontal solid red line) that continuously increases with increasing halo mass. This is in line with the , where galaxies of increased stellar mass are seen to host larger SFRs . Interestingly, the rate of change with for this characteristic SFR does not remain constant, initially increasing by dex between and reducing to almost zero in the regime . This is potential evidence that SFRs in massive systems are not keeping pace with the increasing baryonic inflow rates for increasing halo mass at fixed redshift . BHARs show a less continuous behaviour however, broadly categorized by two rudimentary states: BHs residing in haloes below are typically accreting at a rate ( ); BHs residing in haloes more massive than tend to be accreting at a rate ( ). The fraction of galaxies with for a given halo mass bin is 3%, 21%, 55%, 70% and 78% from to respectively. Those in haloes between the mass range are in an intermediate state.  A fraction of galaxies hosted by haloes with harbour extremely low, or even zero SFRs. As all of these galaxies host massive BHs ( , green dots), we are most likely seeing the effect of recent episodes of violent AGN feedback that have severely reduced the current star-forming capabilities of these systems. The cause, prevalence and impact of these feedback events will be the subject of a future paper.  We now investigate if the growth rate to halo connection evolves. To do this we return to the – relation shown for in  . The population is sub divided into two-dimensional bins, 0.5 dex on a side and outlined as squares. Here we investigate nine bins that lie along the median track through a continuous range spanning in halo mass and in BH mass, each outlined with a unique colour to reference their histories in  .    shows the evolution of the time-averaged SFR (top panel) and time-averaged BHAR (bottom panel) as a function of halo mass for all galaxies that come to reside in one of these two-dimensional bins at the present day (each solid black line is an individual history). We time-average both SFR and BHAR over 100 Myr in order to remove the inherent noise when considering instantaneous growth rates, and unveil the average trend. To eliminate galaxies that were previously classified as satellites of a more massive halo, we only consider central galaxies that have evolved monotonically in their halo mass (this excludes only of the centrals population). We see, that although individual histories can be quite different, on average galaxies and their central BHs do follow a well defined path. The median SFR and BHAR of this population subset for a given halo mass are over-plotted in yellow, annotated by the median redshift at which they were hosted by haloes of that particular mass. As expected, an increasing halo mass corresponds to a decreasing redshift.  There is a striking difference in behaviour seen between the two growth rates as the halo grows. Initially the SFR increases steadily with halo mass. As the halo grows more massive than the SFRs begin to fluctuate between high and low values, yet overall there is a gradual decline of the median trend after this mass. Similarly, BHARs also change their behaviour around , rapidly transitioning from a low () to high () rate. As with SFRs, BHARs decline a similar amount after the halo mass (note the many orders of magnitude difference in the scale of the growth rate axis between the two panels). We interpret therefore, given that the decline of SFR coincides with the peak of the rapid increase in BHAR, that AGN feedback is impeding the continued rise of SFRs in the most massive systems (see   for an individual example of SFR reduction after the peak AGN activity at lookback time ). We note that the decrease in halo mass accretion rate with declining redshift and the dependence of halo cooling rates on halo mass will play ADDITIONAL roles in shaping these histories. However, given the severity of the SFR reduction seen immediately after the BHAR peak, AGN feedback appears to be a dominant factor in hindering further galaxy growth.    extends this analysis to each of the highlighted two-dimensional bins in  , now showing only the median lines for clarity. Remarkably, the evolutionary behaviour is similar regardless of the final position in the – plane. The normalisation of each history is set by the evolving baryonic inflow rate at fixed halo mass. As this rate decreases with redshift , so does the normalisation of both the SFR and BHAR seen here (as each population reaches a particular halo mass at different times). We include also in the bottom panel of   the median ratio between SFR and BHAR shown in the two panels above. This shows that galaxy growth is dominant over BH growth by many orders of magnitude in low mass haloes ( ). As BHARs settle to their rate in haloes of a mass above , the ratio between SFR and BHAR plateaus to an approximately constant value of . Note the trends of both   are not directly observable as they rely on median time-averaged growth rates in both SFR and BHAR of 100 Myr whilst also being binned by halo mass.">
