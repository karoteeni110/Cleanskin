    <title>A Whole-Body Software Abstraction layer for Control Design of
free-floating Mechanical Systems</title>
    <abstract>In this paper, we propose a software abstraction layer to simplify the
design and synthesis of whole-body controllers without making any
preliminary assumptions on the control law to be implemented. The main
advantage of the proposed library is the decoupling of the control
software from implementation details, which are related to the robotic
platform. Furthermore, the resulting code is more clean and concise than
ad-hoc code, as it focuses only on the implementation of the control
law. In addition, we present a reference implementation of the
abstraction layer together with a Simulink interface to provide support
to Model-Driven based development. We also show the implementation of a
simple proportional-derivative plus gravity compensation control
together with a more complex momentum-based bipedal balance controller. </abstract>
