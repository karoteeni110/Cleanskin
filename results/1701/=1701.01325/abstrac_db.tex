The problem of outlier detection is extremely challenging in many
domains such as text, in which the attribute values are typically
non-negative, and most values are zero. In such cases, it often
becomes difficult to separate the outliers from the  natural
variations in the patterns in the underlying data.  In this paper,
we present a matrix factorization method, which is naturally able to
distinguish the anomalies with the use of low rank approximations of
the underlying data.  Our iterative algorithm TONMF is based on
block coordinate descent (BCD) framework. We define blocks over the
term-document matrix such that the function becomes solvable. Given
most recently updated values of other matrix blocks, we always
update one block at a time to its optimal. Our approach has
significant advantages over traditional methods for text outlier
detection. Finally, we present experimental results illustrating the
effectiveness of our method over competing methods.
