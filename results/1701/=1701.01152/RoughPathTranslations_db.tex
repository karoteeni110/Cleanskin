\begin{abstract}
We revisit (higher-order) translation operators on rough paths, in both the geometric and branched setting.  As in Hairer's work on the renormalization of
singular SPDEs we propose a purely algebraic view on the matter. Recent advances in the theory of regularity structures, especially the Hopf algebraic 
interplay of positive and negative renormalization of Bruned--Hairer--Zambotti (2016), are seen to have precise counterparts in the rough path context, even with a similar formalism (short of polynomial decorations and colourings). Renormalization is then seen to correspond precisely to (higher-order) rough path translation.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Rough paths and regularity structures}

The theory of rough paths deals with controlled
differential equations of the form%
\[
dY_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{d}f_{i}\left( Y_{t}\right) dX_{t}^{i}\equiv f\left(
Y_{t}\right) dX_{t}
\]%
where $X:\left[ 0,T\right] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a continuous path
of low, say $\alpha $-H\"{o}lder, regularity for $0<\alpha \leq 1$. As may
be seen by formal Picard iteration, solution can be expanded in terms of
certain integrals. Assuming validity of the chain-rule, these are just
iterated integrals of the form $\int dX^{i_{1}}\cdots dX^{i_{n}}$ with
integration over a~$n$-dimensional simplex. In geometric rough path theory
one postulates the existence of such integrals, for sufficiently many words $%
w=\left( i_{1},\dots ,i_{n}\right) $, namely $\left\vert w\right\vert =n\leq %
\left[ 1/\alpha \right] $, such as to regain analytic control: the
collection of resulting objects%
\[
\left\langle \mathbf{X},w\right\rangle =\int \dots \int dX^{i_{1}}\dots
dX^{i_{n}}\text{ (integration over }s<t_{1}<\dots <t_{n}<t\text{, }\forall
0\leq s<t\leq T\text{)}
\]%
subject to suitable analytic and algebraic constraints (in particular, \textit{%
Chen's relation}, which describes the recentering $s\rightarrow \tilde{s}$ )
is then known as a (level-$n$) \textit{geometric rough path} \cite{Lyons98, LyonsQian02, Lyons07, FrizVictoir10}.
Without assuming a chain-rule (think:\
It\^o), iterated integrals of the form $\int X^{i}X^{j}dX^{k}$ appear in the expansion,
the resulting objects are then naturally indexed by trees, for example
\[
\left\langle \mathbf{X},\tau \right\rangle =\int X^{i}X^{j}dX^{k}\text{ with 
}\tau =\left[ \bullet_i \bullet_j \right] _{\bullet_k} \equiv 
\tikzexternaldisable  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2,baseline=0.1cm]
        \node at (0,0)  [dot,label= {[label distance=-0.2em]below: \scriptsize  $ k $} ] (root) {};
         \node at (1,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ j $}] (right) {};
         \node at (-1,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ i $} ] (left) {};
            \draw[kernel1] (right) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root); \draw[kernel1] (left) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root);
     \end{tikzpicture} \tikzexternaldisable .
\]%
The collection of all such objects, again for sufficiently many trees, $%
\left\vert \tau \right\vert =\#$nodes $\leq \left[ 1/\alpha \right] $ and
subject to algebraic and analytic constraints, form what is known as
a {\it branched rough path} \cite{Gubinelli10, HairerKelly15}; every geometric rough path can
then be canonically viewed as a branched rough path. A basic result -
known as the \textit{extension theorem} \cite{Lyons98, Gubinelli10} - asserts that
all "higher" iterated integrals, $n$-fold with $n>\left[ 1/\alpha \right] $,
are automatically well-defined, with validity of all algebraic and analytic
constraints in the extended setting.\footnote{This entire ensemble of iterated integrals is called the {\it signature} or the {\it fully lifted rough path}.} Solving differential equations driven
by such rough paths can then be achieved, following
\cite{Gubinelli04}, see also \cite{FrizHairer14}, by formulating a fixed point problem in a space
of controlled rough paths, essentially a (linear) space of good integrands
for rough integration (mind that rough path spaces are, in contrast,
fundamentally non-linear due to the afore-mentioned algebraic constraints).
Given a rough differential equation (RDE) of the form%
\[
dY=f\left( Y\right) d\mathbf{X}
\]%
it is interesting to see the effect on $Y$ induced by higher-order
perturbations on $\mathbf{X}$. For instance, one can use It\^{o} integration
to lift a Brownian motion to a (level-2) random rough path, $\mathbf{X}=%
\mathbf{B}^{\Ito}\left( \omega \right) $ of regularity $\alpha \in \left(
1/3,1/2\right) $, in which case the above RDE corresponds to a classical It{\^o}
SDE. However, we may perturb $\mathbf{B}^{\Ito}=\left( B,\mathbb{B}%
^{\Ito}\right) $ via $\mathbb{B}_{s,t}^{\Ito}\mapsto \mathbb{B}_{s,t}^{\Ito}+%
\frac{1}{2}I\left( t-s\right) =:\mathbb{B}_{s,t}^{\Strat}$, without touching
the underlying Brownian path $B$. The above RDE then becomes a Stratonovich
SDE, the effect of this perturbation is then given in terms of an
It{\^o}-Stratonovich correction, here of the form $\frac{1}{2}%
\sum_{i=1}^{d}\nabla _{f_{i}}f_{i}$. Examples from physics (Brownian motion
in a magnetic field) suggest second order perturbation of the form $\mathbb{B%
}_{s,t}^{\Strat}\mapsto \mathbb{B}_{s,t}^{\Strat}+a\left( t-s\right) $, for
some $a\in \mathfrak{so}\left( d\right) $, the SDE then sees an additional drift
vector-field of the form $\sum_{i,j}a^{ij}\left[ f_{i},f_{j}\right] $. All
these examples are but the tip of an iceberg: higher order perturbations
(which can be traced back to Sussmann's work on ODEs driven by highly
oscillatory signals)\ were studied from a\ SDE/RDE perspective in
\cite{FrizOberhauser09}, see also \cite{FrizVictoir10}. The situation is
actually similar for (non-singular, though non-linear) stochastic/rough PDEs: as noted
in  \cite{CFO11}, tampering with higher-levels of the lifted noise affects the structure of the SPDE/RPDE
in a way as one would expect from the methods of ``rough'' characteristics. 

\bigskip \textbf{From rough paths to regularity structures.} The theory of
regularity structures \cite{Hairer14} extends rough path theory and then provides a
remarkable framework to analyse (singular) semi-linear stochastic partial differential
equations, e.g. of the form%
\[
\left( \partial _{t}-\Delta \right) u=f\left( u,Du\right) +g\left( u\right)
\xi \left( t,x,\omega \right) 
\]%
with $\left( d+1\right) $-dimensional space-time white noise. The demarche
is similar as above: noise is lifted to a {\it model}, whose algebraic properties
(especially with regard to recentering) are formulated with the aid of the
{\it structure group}. Given an (abstract) model, a fixed point problem is solved and gives a solution flow in a
(linear) space of {\it modelled distributions}. The abstract solution can then be mapped (``{\it reconstructed}\hspace{0.4mm}'') into an actual Schwartz distribution. In fact,
one has the rather precise correspondences as follows (see \cite{FrizHairer14} for explicit
details in the level-2 setting): 

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|lll|}
\hline
    rough path                   &      $\longleftrightarrow$                 &  model \\ \hline
     Chen's relation                  &      $\longleftrightarrow$           & structure group \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\\
\caption{Basic correspondences: rough paths $\longleftrightarrow$  regularity structures}
\label{my-label}

\end{table}
\noindent Furthermore, one has similar results concerning continuity properties of the solution
map as a function of the enhanced noise:%

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
   continuity of solution in (rough path $\longleftrightarrow $ model) topology \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent Unfortunately mollified lifted noise - in infinite dimensions - in general does not converge (as a model), hence {\it renormalization} plays a fundamental role in regularity structures.  The algebraic formalism of how to conduct this renormalization then relies on heavy Hopf algebraic considerations \cite{Hairer14}, pushed to a (seemingly) definite state of affairs in \cite{BHZ16}, see also \cite{Hairer16} for a
summary. Our investigation was driven by two questions:%

{\it

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Are there meaningful (finite-dimensional) examples from stochastics
which require renormalization?
\item[(2)] Do we have algebraic structures in rough path theory comparable
with those seen in regularity structures? 
\end{itemize}

}

In contrast to common belief, perhaps, the answer to question (1)\ is yes: despite
the fact that reasonable approximations to Brownian motion -- including
piecewise linear - mollifier - Karhunen-Loeve type - and random walk
approximations -- all converge to the (Stratonovich) Brownian rough path,
there are perfectly meaningful (finite-dimensional, and even $1$%
-dimensional!)\ situations which require renormalization. We sketch these in
Section \ref{sec:introex} below, together with precise references. The main part of this
work then deals with, and towards, question (2): Following \cite{BHZ16}, the algebraic formalism in
regularity structures relies crucially on two Hopf algebra, $\TT_{+}$ and $%
\TT_{-}$ (which are further in ``cointeraction''). The first one helps to
construct the structure group which, in turn, provides the recentering
("positive renormalization" in the language of \cite{BHZ16}) and hence constitutes
an abstract form of Chen's relation in rough path theory. In this sense, $%
\TT_{+}$ was always present in rough path theory, the point being enforced in
the case of branched rough paths \cite{Gubinelli10, HairerKelly15} where $%
\TT_{+}$ is effectively given by the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. (Making this
link precise and explicit seems a worthwhile undertaking in its own right,
we accomplish this {\it en passant} in the sequel.) 

Question (2) is then reduced to the question if $\TT_{-}$, built to carry
out the actual renormalization of models, and subsequently SPDEs, ("negative
renormalization" in the language of \cite{BHZ16}), has any correspondence in rough
path theory. Our answer is again affirmative and, very loosely speaking, 
a main insight of this paper is:

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
   translation of rough paths $\longleftrightarrow$ renormalization of models \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Several remarks are in order. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Much of this paper can be read from a rough path perspective only.
That is, despite the looming goal to find a connection to regularity
structures, we first develop the algebraic renormalization theory for rough paths
in its own right; analytic considerations then take place in Section \ref{sec:RDE}. 
The link to regularity structures and its renormalization
theory is only made in Section \ref{sec:renorm}.

\item  In applications to (singular) SPDEs, {\it renormalization} is typically a must-do (with some surprising exceptions such as the motion of a random loop \cite{Hairer16}),
whereas in typical SDE situations, renormalization/translation is a can-do (and hence better called {\it translation}). That said, in the next section we present several examples, 
based on finite- (and even one-) dimensional Brownian motion, which do require genuine renormalization. 


\item Our approach actually differs from the work of Hairer and coauthors \cite{Hairer14,BHZ16}, for
we are taking a \textbf{primal view }which, in the case of branched rough paths,
leads us to make crucial use of pre-Lie structures (a concept not present in
\cite{BHZ16}). Only after developing the corresponding \textbf{dual view}, and
further restricting our general setup, do we start to see precise
correspondences to \cite{BHZ16}. (In Section \ref{sec:12} below we introduce
primal resp. dual view in an elementary setting.) 

\item We have an explicit understanding of the renormalization group in
terms of the Lie algebra associated to the Butcher group, equipped with
vector space addition. (In particular, despite non-commutativity of the
Butcher group, our renormalization group turns out to be abelian, corresponding to addition in the Lie algebra.)

\item The existence of a finite-dimensional renormalization group is much
related to the stationarity of the (lifted) noise, see \cite{Hairer14} and forthcoming work
\cite{ChandraHairerForth}. In the rough path context, this amounts to saying that a
random (branched) rough path $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{X}\left( \omega \right) $,
with values in a (truncated) Butcher (hence finite-dimensional Lie) group $\GG$%
, actually has independent increments with respect to the Grossmann-Larson
product $\star$ (dual to the Connes-Kreimer coproduct $\Delta _{\star}$). In
other words, $\mathbf{X}$ is a (continuous) $\GG$-valued L\'{e}vy process.
This invites a comparison with \cite{FrizShekhar14,Chevyrev15} and in Section \ref{sec:levy} 
we shall see how L\'{e}vy triplets behave under renormalization. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Higher-order translation and renormalization in finite-dimensions}  \label{sec:introex}

\bigskip \textbf{Physical Brownian motion in a (large) magnetic field.} It
was shown in \cite{FGL15} that the motion of a charged Brownian particle, in the
zero mass limit, in a magnetic field naturally leads to a perturbed second
level, of the form $\mathbb{\bar{B}}_{s,t}=\mathbb{B}_{s,t}^{\Strat}+a\left(
t-s\right) $ for some $0\neq a\in \mathfrak{so}\left( d\right) $. Here $a$ is
proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. One can set up the
evolution of the physical\ (finite mass $\varepsilon $) system, with
trajectories $B^{\varepsilon }$, in a way that the magnetic field scales
as a power of $1/\varepsilon $, as a method to model magnetic fields which are very large
in comparison to the (very small) mass. Doing so leads to approximations $%
B^{\varepsilon }$ of Brownian motion, whose canonical rough path lifts $%
\mathbf{B}^{\varepsilon }$ do not converge in rough path space (due to
divergence of the L\'{e}vy's area). This can be rectified by replacing $\mathbf{B%
}^{\varepsilon }$ with a translated rough path $M_{v^{\varepsilon }}\mathbf{B}^{\varepsilon }$, with a
suitable second-level perturbation $v^{\varepsilon }\in \mathfrak{so}\left( d\right) $,
so that $M_{v^{\varepsilon }}\mathbf{B}^{\varepsilon }$ converges in rough
path space. Moreover, $v^{\varepsilon }$ can be chosen so that the renormalized
limit is indeed $\mathbf{B}^{\Strat}$. Details of this second-level renormalization can be found in \cite{BCFForth}. We also point out that higher order renormalization can be expected in the presence of highly oscillatory fields, which also points to some natural connections with homogenization theory.

\textbf{Higher-order Feynman-Kac theory.} Building on works of V. Yu. Krylov, the forthcoming work by Sina Nejad \cite{NejadForth} constructs higher order analogues to the classical Feynman-Kac formula, which utilises a notion of $\Lip^\gamma$ functions on paths inspired by the work of Lyons-Yang~\cite{LyonsYang16}. Switching between non-divergence form (It{\^o})
and sum-of-squares (Stratonovich) generators then has an analogue for higher
order operators, for which a formulation in terms of our rough path translation
operators naturally appear. 

\textbf{Rough stochastic volatility and robust It{\^o} integration.}
Applications from quantitative finance recently led to the pathwise study of the
(1-dimensional)\ It{\^o}-integral,%
\[
\int_{0}^{T}f (  \hat{B}_{t} ) dB_{t}\text{ with }\hat{B}%
_{t}=\int_{0}^{t}\left\vert t-s\right\vert ^{H-1/2}dB_{s}
\]%
where $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is of the form $x \mapsto \exp \left( \eta
x \right) $. When $H\in \left( 0,1/2\right) $, the case relevant in applications, this
stochastic integration is singular in the sense that the mollifier approximations
actually diverge (infinite It{\^o}-Stratonovich correction, due to infinite
quadratic variation of $\hat{B}$ when $H<1/2$).  The integrand $f( B_{t}^{H} )$, which plays the role of a stochastic volatility process ($\eta >0$ is a volatility-of-volatility parameter)
is {\it not} a controlled rough path, nor has the pair $(\hat B,B)$ a satisfactory rough path lift
(the It\^o integral $\int \hat B dB$ is well-defined, but $\int B d \hat B$ is not). The correct ``It\^o rough
path'' in this context is then an $\R^{n+1}$-valued ``partial'' branched rough path of the form 
\[
\left( B,\hat{B},\int \hat{B}d\hat{B},...\int \hat{B}^{n}dB\right) 
\]%
where $n \sim 1/H$. Again, mollifier approximations will diverge but
it is possible to see that one can carry out a renormalization which restores
convergence to the It\^o limit. (Note the similarity with SPDE situations like KPZ.) % from multiplicative stochastic heat equation and KPZ.).
See the forthcoming work \cite{BFGMSForth} for details.

\bigskip \textbf{Fractional delay / Hoff process }Viewed as two-dimensional
rough paths, Brownian motion and its $\varepsilon $-delay, $t\mapsto
(B_{t},B_{t-\varepsilon })$, does not converge to $\left( B,B\right) $, with
- as one may expect - zero area. Instead, the quadratic variation of
Brownian motion leads to a rough path limit of the form $\left( B,B;A\right) 
$ with area of order one. It is then possible
to check that, replacing $B$ by a fBm with Hurst parameter $H<1/2$, the same
construction will yield exploding L\'{e}vy area as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. 
The same phenomena is seen in lead-lag situations, popular in time series
analysis. As in the case of physical Brownian motion in a (large) magnetic
field, these divergences can be cured by applying suitable (second-level)
translation / renormalization operators. See e.g. \cite[Ch.13]{FrizVictoir10}, \cite{Flint16} for the Brownian case,
\cite{BCFForth} for the (singular) fractional case $H<1/2$.

\subsection{Translation of paths: primal vs. dual description} \label{sec:12}

Consider a $d$-dimensional path $X_{t}$, written with respect to the
standard basis $e_{1},\dots ,e_{d}$ of $\R^{d}$,%
\[
X_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{d}X_{t}^{i}e_{i}.
\]%
We are interested in constant speed perturbations, of the form%
\[
T_{v}X_{t}:=X_{t}+tv,\,\,\,\text{\ with }v=\sum_{i=1}^{d}v^{i}e_{i}\in \R^{d}%
\text{.}
\]%
In coordinates, $\left( T_{v}X_{t}\right) ^{i}=X_{t}^{i}+tv^{i}$ for $%
i=1,\dots ,d$, which is just the \textit{dual point of view},%
\[
\left\langle T_{v}X,e_{i}^{\ast }\right\rangle =\left\langle
X_{t},e_{i}^{\ast }\right\rangle +\left\langle tv,e_{i}^{\ast }\right\rangle
.
\]%
For a \textit{primal point of view}, take $e_{0},e_{1},\dots ,e_{d}$ to be the
standard basis of $\R^{1+d}$, and consider the $\R^{1+d}$-valued ``time-space'' path 
$$\bar{X}%
_{t}=X_{t}+X_{t}^{0}e_{0}=\sum_{i=0}^{d}X_{t}^{i}e_{i}
$$ with scalar-valued $%
X_{t}^{0}\equiv t$. We can now write%
\[
T_{v}\bar{X}_{t}=\bar{X}_{t}+tv=X_{t}+X_{t}^{0}\left( e_{0}+v\right) 
\]%
which identifies $T_{v}$ as linear map on $\R^{1+d}$, which maps $%
e_{0}\mapsto e_{0}+v$, and $e_{i}\mapsto e_{i}$ for $i=1,\dots ,d$. This is
our primal view. We then can (and will) also look at general endomorphisms
of the vector space $\R^{1+d}$, which we still write in the form  
\begin{eqnarray*}
e_{j} &\mapsto &e_{j}+v_{j},\,\,j=0,\dots \,,d \\
v_{j} &=&\sum_{i=0}^{d}v_{j}^{i}e_{i}\in \R^{1+d}.
\end{eqnarray*}%
(The initially discussed case corresponds to $\left( v_{0},v_{1},\dots
,v_{d}\right) =\left( v_{0},0,\dots ,0\right) $, with $v_{0}\perp
e_{0}^{\ast }$, and much of the sequel, especially with regard to the dual
view, will take advantage of this additional structure.)

\bigskip

We shall be interested to understand how such perturbations propagate to higher level iterated integrals, whenever $X$ has sufficient structure to make this meaningful.

For instance, if $X=B(\omega)$, a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, an object of interest would be, with repeated (Stratonovich) integration over $\{ (r,s,t): 0 \le r \le s \le t \le T \}$,
$$
    (T_v B)^{ijk} :=  \int \circ (dB^i + v^i\, dr ) \circ (dB^j + v^j\, ds)  \circ (dB^k + v^k\, dt) =  B_t^{ijk} + ... $$
where the omitted terms (dots) can be spelled out in terms of contractions of $v$ (resp. tensor-powers of $v$) and iterated integrals of $(1+d)$-dimensional time-space Brownian motion ``$(t,B)$''. (Observe that we just gave a dual description of this perturbation, as seen on the third level, yet the initial perturbation took place at the first level: $v$ is vector here.)

There is interest in higher-level perturbations. In particular, given a $2$-tensor $v = \sum_{i,j=1}^d v^{ij} e_i \otimes e_j$, we can consider the level-2-perturbation with no effect on the first level, i.e., $(T_v B_t)^{i} \equiv B_t^{i}$, while for all $i,j=1,...,d$,
$$
        (T_v B_t)^{ij} = B_t^{ij} + v^{ij}\, t
$$
For instance, writing $B^{I;w}$ for iterated It\^{o} integrals, in contrast to $B^w$ defined by iterated Stratonovich integration, we have with $v := \frac{1}{2} I^d$ where $(I^d)^{ij} = \delta^{ij}$, i.e., the identity matrix,
$$
       (T_v B_t )^{I;ij} = B_t^{ij}.
$$
This is nothing but a restatement of the familiar formula $\int_0^t B^i \circ dB^j = \int_0^t B^i dB^j +\tfrac{1}{2} \delta^{ij} t $.
It is a non-trivial exercise to understand the It\^{o}-Stratonovich correction at the level of higher iterated integrals, cf.~\cite{BenArous89} and a ``branched'' version thereof briefly discussed in Section \ref{subsec:ItoStrat} below. Further examples were already given in the previous section, notably the case $\bar B^{ij} = (T_a B_t)^{ij}$ with an anti-symmetric $2$-tensor $a = (a^{ij})$ which arises in the study of Brownian particles in a magnetic field. 


\subsection{Organization of the paper}


This note is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:TgRP}, we first discuss renormalization/translation in the by now well established setting of geometric rough paths. The algebraic 
background is found for instance in~\cite{Reutenauer93}. We then, in Section \ref{sec:TbRP},  move to branched rough paths~\cite{Gubinelli10}, in the notation and formalism from Hairer-Kelly~\cite{HairerKelly15}. In Section \ref{sec:Ex} we illustrate the use of the (branched) translation operator (additional examples were already mentioned in Section 
\ref{sec:introex}.), while in Section \ref{sec:RDE} we describe the analytic and algebraic effects of such translations on rough paths and associated RDEs. Lastly, Section~\ref{sec:renorm} is devoted to the systematic comparison of the translation operator and ``negative renormalization'' introduced in \cite{BHZ16}.

\section{Translation of geometric rough paths} \label{sec:TgRP}

{\it We review the algebraic setup for geometric rough paths, as enhancements of $X=(X_0,X_1, ... , X_d)$, a signal with values in $V=\R^{1+d}$. Recall the natural state-space of such rough paths is $T((V))$, a space of tensor series (resp. a suitable truncation thereof related to the regularity of $X$). Typically $\dot X \equiv (\xi_0,\xi_1,..., \xi_d)$ models noise. Eventually, we will be interested in $X_0 (t) = t$, so that $X$ is a time-space (rough) path, though this plays little role in this section. 
}


\subsection{Preliminaries for tensor series}\label{subsec:TensorPrelims}

We first establish the notation and conventions used throughout the paper. Most algebraic aspects used in this section may be found in~\cite{Reutenauer93} and~\cite{FrizVictoir10} Chapter~7.

Throughout the paper we let $\{e_0, e_1,\ldots, e_d\}$ be a basis for $\R^{1+d}$. Let
\[
(\GDual, \tensor ,\Deltashuff, \alpha)
\]
denote the Hopf algebra of tensor series equipped with tensor product $\tensor$, the coproduct $\Deltashuff$ which is dual to to the shuffle product $\shuffle$ on $\GPrimal$, and antipode $\alpha$. Recall that $\Deltashuff$ is explicitly given as the unique algebra morphism such that
\begin{align*}
\Deltashuff &: \GDual \mapsto \GDual\otimes\GDual \\
\Deltashuff &: v \mapsto v\otimes 1 + 1\otimes v, \; \; \forall v \in \R^{1+d}.
\end{align*}
We shall often refer to elements $e_{i_1}\tensor\ldots \tensor e_{i_k}$ as words consisting of the letters $e_{i_1}, \ldots, e_{i_k} \in \{e_0,\ldots, e_d\}$, and shall write $e_{i_1,\ldots, i_k} = e_{i_1}\tensor\ldots \tensor e_{i_k}$.


We likewise denote by
\[
(\GPrimal, \shuffle, \Delta_\tensor, \tilde \alpha)
\]
the shuffle Hopf algebra. Recall that by identifying $\R^{1+d}$ with its dual through the basis $\{e_0,\ldots, e_d\}$, there is a natural duality between $\GPrimal$ and $\GDual$ in which $\shuffle$ is dual to $\Delta_\shuffle$, and $\tensor$ is dual to $\Delta_\tensor$.


We let $G(\R^{1+d})$ and $\LL((\R^{1+d}))$ denote the set of group-like and primitive elements of $\GDual$ respectively. Recall that $\LL((\R^{1+d}))$ is precisely the space of Lie series over $\R^{1+d}$, and that
\[
G(\R^{1+d}) = \exp_\tensor(\LL((\R^{1+d}))).
\]
%Note that we shall always consider $G(\R^{1+d})$ over $\R^{1+d}$, and thus do not write $\R^{1+d}$ in our notation for the group-like elements.

For any integer $N \geq 0$, we denote by $T^N(\R^{1+d})$ the truncated algebra obtained as the quotient of $\GDual$ by the ideal consisting of all series with no words of length less than $N$ (we keep in mind that the tensor product is always in place on $T^N(\R^{1+d})$). Similarly we let $\G^N(\R^{1+d}) \subset T^N(\R^d)$ and $\LL^N(\R^{1+d}) \subset T^N(\R^{1+d})$ denote the step-$N$ free nilpotent Lie group and Lie algebra over $\R^{1+d}$ respectively, constructed in analogous ways.
%By an abuse of notation, we also denote by $T^N(\R^{1+d})$ the subspace of $T((\R^{1+d}))$ spanned by words of length at most $N$.

Finally, we identify $\R^d$ with the subspace of $\R^{1+d}$ with basis $\{e_1,\ldots, e_d\}$. From this identification, we canonically treat all objects discussed above built from $\R^d$ as subsets of their counterparts built from $\R^{1+d}$.
%, and shall add the symbol $(\R^d)$ to distinguish them.
For example, we treat the algebra $T((\R^d))$ and Lie algebra $\LL^N(\R^d)$ as a subalgebra of $\GDual$ and a Lie subalgebra of $\LL^N(\R^{1+d})$ respectively.


\subsection{Translation of tensor series}\label{subsec:TensorTranslate}


\begin{definition}
For a collection of Lie series $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d)\subset \LL((\R^{1+d}))$, define the algebra morphism $T_v : \GDual \mapsto \GDual$ as the unique extension of the linear map
\begin{align*}
T_v &: \R^{1+d} \mapsto \LL((\R^{1+d})) \\
T_v &: e_i \mapsto e_i + v_i, \; \; \forall i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}


In the sequel we shall often be concerned with the case that $v_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\ldots, d$ and $v_0$ takes a special form. We shall make precise whenever such a condition is in place by writing, for example, $v = v_0 \in \LL^N(\R^{d})$.

%In the sequel we shall mostly be concerned with the case that $v_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\ldots, d$ and $v_0 \in \LL^N(\R^d)$ for some integer $N \geq 1$, i.e., $v_0$ contains neither words with the letter $e_0$ nor words of length greater than $N$, as we shall see this gives rise to a specific type of perturbation of rough paths. Whenever this condition is in place, we shall write $v = v_0 \in \LL^N(\R^d)$.

We observe the following immediate properties of $T_v$:

\begin{itemize}
\item Since $T_v$ is an algebra morphism which preserves the Lie algebra $\LL((\R^{1+d}))$, it holds that $T_v$ maps $G(\R^{1+d})$ into $G(\R^{1+d})$;

%\item $T_v(g \otimes h) = T_v(g) \otimes T_v(h)$ for all $g,h \in T((\R^{1+d}))$;

\item $T_v \circ T_u = T_{v + T_v(u)}$, where we write $T_v(u) := (T_v(u_0),\ldots, T_v(u_d))$. In particular, $T_{v+u} = T_v \circ T_u$ for all $v = v_0,u = u_0 \in \LL((\R^{d}))$;
%, i.e., $v$ and $u$ do not contain words with the letter $e_0$;

\item For every integer $N \geq 0$, $T_v$ induces a well-defined algebra morphism $T^N_v : T^N(\R^{1+d}) \mapsto T^N(\R^{1+d})$, which furthermore maps $\G^N(\R^{1+d})$ into itself.
\end{itemize}

The following lemma moreover shows that $T_v$ respects the Hopf algebra structure of $\GDual$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:HopfMorph}
The map $T_v : \GDual \mapsto \GDual$ is a Hopf algebra morphism. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By construction, $T_v$ respects the product $\tensor$. To show that $(T_v \otimes T_v) \Delta_\shuffle = \Delta_\shuffle T_v$, note that both $(T_v \otimes T_v) \Delta_\shuffle$ and $\Delta_\shuffle T_v$ are algebra morphisms, and so they are equal provided they agree on $e_0,\ldots, e_d$. Indeed, we have
\[
\Delta_\shuffle T_v (e_i) = \Delta_\shuffle (e_i + v_i) = 1 \otimes (e_i + v_i) + (e_i + v_i) \otimes 1
\]
(here we used that each $v_i$ is a Lie element, i.e., primitive in the sense $\Delta_\shuffle v_i = 1 \otimes v_i + v_i \otimes 1$) and
\[
(T_v \otimes T_v) \Delta_\shuffle (e_i) = (T_v\otimes T_v) (1\otimes e_i + e_i\otimes 1) = 1 \otimes (e_i + v_i) + (e_i + v_i) \otimes 1,
\]
as required. So far, we have shown $T_v$ is a bialgebra morphism. It remains to show that $T_v$ commutes with the antipode $\alpha$. Actually, this is implied by general principles (\cite{Preiss16} Theorem~2.14), but as it is short to spell out, we give a direct argument: consider the opposite algebra $(\GDual)^{\op}$ (same set and vector space structure as $\GDual$ but with reverse multiplication). Then $\alpha : \GDual \mapsto (\GDual)^{\op}$ is an algebra morphism, and again it suffices to check that $\alpha T_v$ and $T_v \alpha$ agree on $e_0,\ldots, e_d$. Indeed, since $v_i \in \LL((\R^{1+d}))$, we have $\alpha(v_i) = -v_i$, and thus
\[
\alpha T_v(e_i) = \alpha(e_i + v_i) = -e_i - v_i
\] 
and
\[
T_v \alpha(e_i) = T_v(-e_i) = -e_i - v_i.
\]
\end{proof}


\subsection{Dual action on the shuffle Hopf algebra $T(\R^{1+d})$}  \label{subsec:DualMapGeom}


We now wish to describe the dual map $T_v^* : \GPrimal \mapsto \GPrimal$ for which
\[
\gen{T_v x, y} = \gen{x, T_v^* y}, \; \; \forall x \in \GDual, \; \; \forall y \in \GPrimal.
\]
We note immediately that Lemma~\ref{lem:HopfMorph} implies $T^*_v$ is a Hopf algebra morphism from $(\GPrimal, \shuffle, \Delta_\tensor, \tilde \alpha)$ to itself.

%We note immediately that since $T_v : \GDual \mapsto \GDual$ is a Hopf algebra morphism by Lemma~\ref{lem:HopfMorph}, it follows that $T^*_v$ is likewise a Hopf algebra morphism from $(\GPrimal, \shuffle, \Delta_\tensor, \tilde \alpha)$ to itself.

For simplicity, and as this is the case most relevant to us, we only consider in detail the case $v = v_0 \in \LL((\R^{1+d}))$, i.e., $v_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\ldots, d$ (but see Remark~\ref{remark:generalGeom} for a description of the general case).


%{\color{red} Let $\SSS = S(\bigoplus_{k=1}^\infty (\R^{1+d})^{\tensor k})$ denote the symmetric algebra over $\bigoplus_{k=1}^\infty (\R^{1+d})^{\tensor k}$, i.e., the unital free commutative algebra generated by the non-empty words $e_{i_1,\ldots,i_k} = e_{i_1}\tensor \ldots\tensor e_{i_k}$ in $\GPrimal$.}

Let $\SSS$ denote the unital free commutative algebra generated by the non-empty words $e_{i_1,\ldots,i_k} = e_{i_1}\tensor \ldots\tensor e_{i_k}$ in $\GPrimal$. We let $\mathbf{1}$ and $\cdot$ denote the unit element and product of $\SSS$ respectively. For example, 
\begin{align*}
e_{0,1} \cdot e_2 &= e_2 \cdot e_{0,1} \in \SSS, \\
e_0 \cdot e_{1,2} &\ne e_0 \cdot  e_{2,1} \in \SSS.
\end{align*}


For a word $w \in \GPrimal$, we let $D(w)$ denote the set of all elements
\[
w_1\cdot\ldots \cdot w_k \otimes \tilde w \in \SSS \otimes T(\R^{1+d})
\]
where $w_1,\ldots,w_k$ is formed from disjoint subwords of $w$ and $\tilde w$ is the word obtained by replacing every $w_i$ in $w$ with $e_0$ (note that $\mathbf{1} \otimes w$, corresponding to $k=0$, is also in $D(w)$).


Consider the linear map $S : \GPrimal \mapsto \SSS \otimes \GPrimal$ defined for all words $w \in \GPrimal$ by
\[
S(w) = \sum_{w_1\cdot\ldots \cdot w_k \otimes \tilde w \in D(w)} w_1\cdot\ldots \cdot w_k \otimes \tilde w.
\]
For example
\begin{align*}
S(e_{0,1,2}) =& \mathbf{1} \otimes (e_{0,1,2,}) \\
&+ (e_0)\otimes (e_{0,1,2}) + (e_1)\otimes(e_{0,0,2}) + (e_2) \otimes (e_{0,1,0}) \\
&+ (e_0 \cdot e_1) \otimes (e_{0,0,2}) + (e_0 \cdot e_2)\otimes (e_{0,1,0}) + (e_1 \cdot e_2) \otimes (e_{0,0,0}) \\
&+ (e_0 \cdot e_1 \cdot e_2)\otimes (e_{0,0,0}) + (e_{0,1})\otimes (e_{0,2}) + (e_{1,2}) \otimes (e_{0,0}) \\
&+ (e_{0,1} \cdot e_2) \otimes (e_{0,0}) + (e_0 \cdot e_{1,2}) \otimes (e_{0,0}) \\
&+ (e_{0,1,2}) \otimes (e_0).
\end{align*}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:adjointTv}
Let $v = v_0 \in \LL((\R^{1+d}))$. The dual map $T_v^* : \GPrimal \mapsto \GPrimal$ is given by
\[
T_v^* w = (v \otimes \id) S(w),
\]
where $v(w_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot w_k) := \gen{w_1,v}\ldots\gen{w_k, v}$ and $v(\mathbf{1}) := 1$.
\end{proposition}

In principle, Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointTv} can be proved algebraically by showing that the adjoint of $\Phi := (v \otimes \id) S$ is an algebra morphism from $T((\R^{1+d}))$ to itself, and check that $\Phi^*(e_i) = T_v(e_i)$ for every generator $e_i$. Indeed this is the method used in Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapBranched} to prove the analogous result for the translation map on branched rough paths. However in the current setting of geometric rough paths, we can provide a direct combinatorial proof.

\begin{proof}
Note that the claim is equivalent to showing that for every two words $u, w \in \GPrimal$ (treating $u \in \GDual$)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tensorSum}
\gen{T_v u, w} = \sum_{w_1\cdot\ldots \cdot w_k \otimes \tilde w \in D(w)} \gen{w_1,v} \ldots \gen{w_k, v} \gen{\tilde w, u}.
\end{equation}
Consider a word $u =e_{i_1}\tensor \ldots \tensor e_{i_k} \in \GPrimal$. Then
\[
T_v(u) = e_{i_1} \tensor \ldots \tensor (e_0 +v) \tensor \ldots \tensor e_{i_k},
\]
where every occurrence of $e_0$ in $u$ is replaced by $e_0 + v$. We readily deduce that for every $w \in \GPrimal$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wiSum}
\gen{T_v(u),w} = \sum_{\substack{w_1\cdot\ldots \cdot w_k \otimes \tilde w \in D(w) \\ u=\tilde w}} \gen{w_1,v} \ldots \gen{w_k, v}.
\end{equation}
For example, with $v = [e_1,e_2] = e_{1,2} - e_{2,1}$ and $u = e_{0,1,2}$, we have
\[
T_v(u) = e_{0,1,2} + e_{1,2,1,2} - e_{2,1,1,2},
\]
and we see that indeed for
\[
w \in A := \{e_{0,1,2}, e_{1,2,1,2}, e_{2,1,1,2}\},
\]
the right hand side of~\eqref{eq:wiSum} gives $\gen{T_v(u),w}$, whilst $\gen{w_1,v}\ldots\gen{w_k,v} = 0$ for all $w \in \GPrimal \setminus A$ and $w_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot w_k \otimes \tilde w \in D(w)$ such that $u= \tilde w$. But now~\eqref{eq:wiSum} immediately implies~\eqref{eq:tensorSum}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:generalGeom}
A similar result to Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointTv} holds for the general case $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d)$. The definition of $S$ changes in the obvious way that in the second tensor, instead of replacing every subword by the letter $e_0$, one instead replaces every combination of subwords by all combinations of $e_i$, $i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}$, while in the first tensor, one marks each extracted subword $w_j$ with the corresponding label $i \in \{0, \ldots, d\}$ that replaced it, which gives $(w_j)_i$ (so the left tensor no longer belongs to $\SSS$ but instead to the free commutative algebra generated by $(w)_i$, for all words $w \in \GPrimal$ and labels $i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}$). Finally the term $\gen{w_1,v}\ldots\gen{w_k, v}$ would then be replaced by $\gen{(w_1)_{i_1}, v_{i_1}}\ldots \gen{(w_k)_{i_k}, v_{i_k}}$.
\end{remark}

\section{Translation of branched rough paths}   \label{sec:TbRP}
\label{sec:Branched}

{\it In the previous section we studied the translation operator $T$, in the setting relevant for geometric rough path. Here we extend these results to the branched rough path setting, calling the translation operator $M$ to avoid confusion. Our construction of $M$ faces new difficulties, which we resolve with pre-Lie structures. The dual view then leads us to an extraction procedure of subtrees (a concept familiar from regularity structures, to be explored in Section~\ref{sec:renorm}).
}

\subsection{Preliminaries for forest series}\label{subsec:PrelimsForest}

As in the preceding section, we first introduce the notation used throughout the section. We mostly follow the notation of Hairer-Kelly~\cite{HairerKelly15} and refer the reader to~\cite{GraciaBondia01} Chapter~14 for relevant algebraic material.

We let $\BB$ denote the real vector space spanned by the set of unordered rooted trees with vertices labelled from the set $\{0,\ldots, d\}$. We denote by $\BB^*$ its algebraic dual, which we identify with the space of formal series of labelled trees. We canonically identify with $\R^{1+d}$ the subspace of $\BB$ (and of $\BB^*$) spanned by the trees with a single vertex $\{\bullet_0,\ldots, \bullet_d\}$.

We further denote by $\BPrimal$ the vector space spanned by (unordered) forests composed of trees (including the empty forest denoted by $1$), and let $\BDual$ denote its algebraic dual which we identify with the space of formal series of forests. We canonically treat $\BB^*$ as a subspace of $\BDual$. Following commonly used notation (e.g.,~\cite{HairerKelly15}),
%p.217),
for trees $\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n \in \BB$ we let $[\tau_1\ldots\tau_n]_{\bullet_i} \in \BB$ denote the forest $\tau_1\ldots\tau_n \in \BPrimal$ grafted onto the vertex $\bullet_i$.

We equip $\BDual$ with the structure of the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra
\[
(\BDual, \star, \Delta_\poly, \alpha)
\]
and $\BPrimal$ with the structure of the dual graded Hopf algebra (the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra)
\[
(\BPrimal, \poly, \Delta_\star, \tilde\alpha).
\]
In other words, $\BPrimal$ is the free commutative algebra over $\BB$ equipped with a coproduct $\Delta_\star$, and graded by the number of vertices in a forest. We shall often drop the product $\poly$ and simply write $\tau\poly \sigma = \tau \sigma$.

The coproduct $\Delta_\star$ may be described in terms of admissible cuts, for which we use the convention to keep the ``trunk'' on the right: for every tree $\tau \in \BB$
\[
\Delta_\star \tau = \sum_c \tau^c_1\ldots \tau^c_k \otimes \tau^c_0,
\]
where we sum over all admissible cuts $c$ of $\tau$, and denote by $\tau^c_0$ the trunk and by $\tau^c_1\ldots \tau^c_k$ the branches of the cut respectively.


In the sequel, we shall also find it convenient to treat the space $\BPrimal$ equipped with $\star$ as a subalgebra of $\BDual$, in which case we explicitly refer to it as the algebra $(\BPrimal,\star)$.

Recall that the space of series $\BB^*$ is exactly the set of primitive elements of $\BDual$. We let $\GG$ denote the group-like elements of $\BDual$, often called the Butcher group, for which it holds that
\[
\GG = \exp_\star (\BB^*).
\]

All the objects introduced above play an analogous role to those of the previous section. To summarise this correspondence, it is helpful to keep the following picture in mind
\footnote{The reader may wish for a more unified notation of these spaces. However, it does not appear wise to deviate from established notation in the geometric rough path literature,
nor do we want to change notation from \cite{HairerKelly15}, which is our main source for branched rough paths.

Also, our use of the adjectives ``primal'' and ``dual'' is motivated by viewing the rough path state space as primal, see Section \ref{sec:12}, whereas words/trees are viewed as dual objects. This is somewhat the other way round in \cite{HairerKelly15}, wherer these spaces were introduced as $\BDual$ and $\BPrimal$, respectively. No confusion will arise of this.}

\begin{align*}
&\text{``Primal space'' ...} &&\BDual &\longleftrightarrow &&\GDual \\
&\text{``Dual space'' ...} && \BPrimal &\longleftrightarrow &&\GPrimal \\
&\text{Lie elements ...} &&\BB^* \subset \BDual  &\longleftrightarrow && \LL((\R^{1+d})) \\
&\text{Group-like elements ...} &&\GG \subset \BDual &\longleftrightarrow && G(\R^{1+d}).
\end{align*}


As in the previous section, for any integer $N \geq 0$ we let $\BPrimal^N$ denote ``truncated'' algebra obtained by the quotient of $\BDual$ by the ideal consisting of all series with no forests having less than $N$ vertices (we keep in mind that the product $\star$ is always in place for the truncated objects). Similarly we let $\GG^N \subset \BPrimal^N$ and $\BB^N \subset \BPrimal^N$ denote the step-$N$ Butcher Lie group over $\R^{1+d}$ its and Lie algebra respectively, constructed in analogous ways.


Finally, as before, we use $(\R^{d})$ to denote the analogous objects built from $\R^d$, and which we treat as subsets of their ``full'' counterparts built from $\R^{1+d}$ (by identifying $\R^d$ with the subspace of $\R^{1+d}$ with basis $\{e_1,\ldots, e_d\}$). For example, we treat $\BDual(\R^d)$ and $\BB^N(\R^d)$ as a subalgebra of $\BDual$ and a Lie subalgebra of $\BB^N$ respectively.


%
%{\color{green} 
%In Section~\ref{subsubsec:PreLie} we shall discuss a universal property of $\BB$ which allows us to canonically extend linear maps $M : \R^{1+d} \mapsto \BB$ to algebra morphisms $M : \HH \mapsto \HH$.
%
%We now wish to extend the construction from the previous section to the setting of branched rough paths over $\R^{1+d}$, which we recall take values in the Butcher group $\GG_N$. 
%
%Recall that $\BB \subset \HH$ denotes the vector space of series of trees. A typical element of $\BB$ is given by
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:treeSum}
%\sigma = \sum_{n \geq 1} \sum_{|\tau| = n} \lambda_\tau \tau,
%\end{equation}
%where $\lambda_\tau \in \R$ and the second sum runs over all rooted labelled trees $\tau \in \HH$ with $n$ vertices.
%
%For $v \in \BB$, we aim to define an algebra morphism $M_v : \HH \mapsto \HH$ analogous to the map $T_v$ from the previous section. For this purpose, we first recall a universal property of $\BB$.}

\subsection{Translation of forest series} 
\label{subsec:transBranched}

\subsubsection{Non-uniqueness of algebra extensions}

In the previous section, we defined a map $T_v$ which ``translated'' elements in $\GDual$ in directions $(v_0,\ldots,v_d) \subset \LL((\R^{1+d}))$, and which mapped the set of group-like elements $\G(\R^{1+d})$ into itself. In the same spirit, we aim to define a map $M_v$ which translates elements in $\BDual$ in directions $(v_0,\ldots,v_d) \subset \BB^*$, and which likewise maps $\GG$ into itself.

Note that our construction of $T_v$ relied on the fact that any linear map $M : \R^{1+d} \mapsto \GDual$ extended uniquely to an algebra morphism $M : \GDual \mapsto \GDual$ (for the product $\tensor$). We note here that no such universal property holds for $\BDual$; indeed, there exists a canonical injective algebra morphism
\begin{align}
\begin{split}\label{eq:tensorForestEmbed}
\imath &: \GDual \mapsto \BDual \\
\imath &: e_i \mapsto \bullet_i
\end{split}
\end{align}
which embeds $\GDual$ into a \emph{strict} subalgebra of $\BDual$. 

Specifically, we can see that $\imath$ is injective by considering the space $\BB^*_\ell \subset \BB^*$ of linear trees, i.e., trees of the form $[\ldots[\bullet_{i_1}]_{\bullet_{i_2}}]\ldots]_{\bullet_{i_k}}$. Then there is a natural projection $\pi_\ell : \BDual \mapsto \BB^*_\ell$, and one can readily see that $\pi_\ell \circ \imath$ is a vector space isomorphism (this is the same isomorphism described in Remark~2.7 of~\cite{HairerKelly15}). To see further that the image of $T((\R^{1+d}))$ under $\imath$ is not all of $\BDual$, it suffices to observe that the linear tree $[\bullet_i]_{\bullet_j}$ is not in the algebra generated by $\{\bullet_i\}_{i=1}^{1+d}$.

\begin{remark}
The embedding $\imath$ arises naturally in the context of branched rough paths as this is essentially the embedding used in~\cite{HairerKelly15} to realise geometric rough paths as branched rough paths (though note $\imath$ in~\cite{HairerKelly15} denotes $\pi_\ell \circ \imath$ in our notation).
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}\label{remark:freeAlgebra}
While the above argument shows that $(\BB, [\cdot,\cdot])$ is clearly not isomorphic to $\LL(\R^{1+d})$ as a Lie algebra, it is a curious and non-trivial fact that $(\BB, [\cdot,\cdot])$ \emph{is} isomorphic to a free Lie algebra generated by another subspace of $\BB$. Correspondingly, $(\HH,\star)$, being isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of $\BB$, is isomorphic to a tensor algebra (see~\cite{Foissy02} Section~8, or~\cite{Chapoton10}).
\end{remark}

It follows form the above discussion that given a map $M : \R^{1+d} \mapsto \BDual$, even one whose range is in $\BB^*$, there is in general no canonical choice of how to extend $M$ to elements outside $\imath(\GDual)$ if we only demand that the extension $M : \BDual \mapsto \BDual$ is an algebra morphsim (moreover, without calling on Remark~\ref{remark:freeAlgebra}, it is {\it a priori} not even clear that such an extension always exists).

\begin{example}
Consider the $1+d = 1$ (i.e., a single label $0$), and the map $M : \{\bullet_0, [\bullet_0]_{\bullet_0}\} \mapsto \BB^*$ given by
\begin{align*}
M &: \bullet_0 \mapsto \bullet_0 \\
M &: [\bullet_0]_{\bullet_0} \mapsto \bullet_0.
\end{align*}
Since
\[
\bullet_0 \star \bullet_0 = [\bullet_0]_{\bullet_0} + 2 \bullet_0 \bullet_0,
\]
we may extend $M$ to an algebra morphism on the truncated space $\HH^2 \mapsto \HH^2$ by setting
\[
M(\bullet_0\bullet_0) = \frac{1}{2}\left( [\bullet_0]_{\bullet_0} + 2\bullet_0\bullet_0 - \bullet_0 \right).
\]
This example shows that, on the level of the truncated algebras, there is not a unique algebra morphism above the identity map $\id : \bullet_0 \mapsto \bullet_0$.

Of course it is not clear from the above that the identity map $\id : \bullet_0 \mapsto \bullet_0$ can extend in a non-trivial way to an algebra morphism on all of $\BDual \mapsto \BDual$, but such extensions will always exist due to Remark~\ref{remark:freeAlgebra}.
\end{example}

In what follows, we address this non-uniqueness issue by demanding a finer structure on the extension of $M$, namely that $M : \BB^* \mapsto \BB^*$ is a \emph{pre-Lie algebra} morphism.
The notion of a pre-Lie algebra will be recalled in the following subsection, and the significance of preserving the pre-Lie product on $\BB^*$ will be made precise in Section~\ref{subsec:effectsRDEs}. For now we simply state that this is a natural condition to demand given the role of pre-Lie algebras in control theory and Butcher series~\cite{Calaque11,Manchon11}. 

\subsubsection{The free pre-Lie algebra over $\R^{1+d}$} \label{subsubsec:PreLie}

\begin{definition}
A (left) \emph{pre-Lie algebra} is a vector space $V$ with a bilinear map $\triangleright : V\times V \mapsto V$, called the \emph{pre-Lie product}, such that
\[
(x \triangleright y)\triangleright z - x\triangleright(y\triangleright z) = (y \triangleright x)\triangleright z - y\triangleright(x \triangleright z), \; \; \forall x,y,z \in V.
\]
That is, the associator $(x,y,z) := (x \triangleright y)\triangleright z - x\triangleright(y\triangleright z)$ is invariant under exchanging $x$ and $y$.
\end{definition}

One can readily check that every pre-Lie algebra $(V, \triangleright)$ induced a Lie algebra $(V, [\cdot,\cdot])$ consisting of the same vector space $V$ with bracket $[x,y] := x\triangleright y - y\triangleright x$.

\begin{example}\label{example:vectfieldsPreLie}
A basic example of a pre-Lie algebra is the space of smooth vector fields on $\R^e$ with the product $(f_i \partial_i) \triangleright (f_j\partial_j) := (f_i \partial_i f_j) \partial_j$. The induced bracket is the usual Lie bracket of vector fields.
\end{example} 


The space of trees $\BB$ can be equipped with a (non-associative) pre-Lie product $\curvearrowright : \BB \times \BB \mapsto \BB$ defined by
\[
\tau_1 \curvearrowright \tau_2 = \sum_{\tau} n(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau)\tau,
\]
where the sum is over all trees $\tau \in \BB$ and $n(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau)$ is the number of \emph{single} admissible cuts of $\tau$ for which the branch is $\tau_1$ and the trunk is $\tau_2$.
Equivalently, $\curvearrowright$ is given in terms of $\star$ by
 \[
\tau_1 \curvearrowright \tau_2 = \pi_{\BB}(\tau_1 \star \tau_2),
\]
where $\pi_\BB : \BPrimal \mapsto \BB$ is the projection onto $\BB$.

It holds that $(\BB,\curvearrowright)$ indeed defines a Lie algebra for which
\[
[\tau_1,\tau_2] := \tau_1 \curvearrowright \tau_2 - \tau_2 \curvearrowright \tau_1 = \tau_1 \star \tau_2 - \tau_2 \star \tau_1, 
\]
i.e., the Lie algebra structures on $\BB$ induced by $\star$ and $\curvearrowright$ coincide. Moreover since $\curvearrowright$ respects the grading of $\BB$, we can naturally extend $\curvearrowright$ to a bilinear map on the space of series, so that $(\BB^*, \curvearrowright)$ is also a pre-Lie algebra.

%Denote by $\BB^*$ the subspace of $\BB$ spanned by trees, i.e., the space of all $\sigma \in \BB$ of the form~\eqref{eq:treeSum} where the sum is finite, and note that $(\BB^*, \rightarrow)$ forms a pre-Lie subalgebra of $(\BB,\rightarrow)$.

We now recall the following universal property of $(\BB, \curvearrowright)$ first established by Chapoton and Livernet~\cite{Chapoton01} Corollary~1.10 (see also~\cite{Dzhumadildaev02} Theorem~6.3).
%, or Szczesny~\cite{Szczesny10} Theorem 1).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:freePreLie}
The space $(\BB, \curvearrowright)$ is the free pre-Lie algebra over $\R^{1+d}$.
\end{theorem}

An equivalent formulation of Theorem~\ref{thm:freePreLie} is that for any pre-Lie algebra $(V, \triangleright)$ and linear map $M : \R^{1+d} \mapsto V$, there exists a unique extension of $M$ to a pre-Lie algebra morphism $M : (\BB,\curvearrowright) \mapsto (V, \triangleright)$.


\subsubsection{Construction of the translation map}\label{subsubsec:TransBranched}

An immediate consequence of Theorem~\ref{thm:freePreLie} is the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:branchedAlgMorph}
Every linear map $M : \R^{1+d} \mapsto \BB^*$ extends to a unique algebra morphism $M : \BDual \mapsto \BDual$ whose restriction to $\BB^*$ is a pre-Lie algebra morphism from $\BB^*$ to itself.
%$\restr{M}{\BB^*} : \BB^* \mapsto \BB^*$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:freePreLie}, $M$ extends uniquely to a pre-Lie algebra morphism $M : \BB \mapsto \BB^*$. Recall that for a Lie algebra $\g$, the universal enveloping algebra $U(\g)$ is the (unique up to isomorphism) algebra such that $\g$ embeds into $U(\g)$, and for any algebra $A$, every Lie algebra morphism $f : \g \mapsto A$ extends uniquely to an algebra morphism $f : U(\g) \mapsto A$. Recall also that, by the Milnor-Moore theorem, $(\HH,\star)$ is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of $(\BB, [\cdot,\cdot])$.

It thus follows that $M$ extends further to a unique algebra morphism $M : (\HH,\star) \mapsto (\BDual, \star)$. Finally, since $M$ necessarily does not decrease the degree of every element $x \in \HH$, we obtain a unique extension $M : \BDual \mapsto \BDual$ for which the restriction $M : \BB^* \mapsto \BB^*$ is a pre-Lie algebra morphism as desired.
\end{proof}


We can finally define a natural translation map $M_v : \BDual \mapsto \BDual$ analogous to $T_v$.

\begin{definition}
For $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d) \subset \BB^*$, define $M_v : \BDual \mapsto \BDual$ as the unique algebra morphism obtained in Theorem~\ref{thm:branchedAlgMorph} from the linear map
\begin{align*}
M_v &: \R^{1+d} \mapsto \BB^* \\
M_v &: \bullet_i \mapsto \bullet_i + v_i,  \; \; \forall i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
Let us illustrate how the construction works in the case of two nodes with a single label $0$. Since $M_{v}$ is constructed as pre-Lie algebra morphism, we compute
\[
M_{v}\left( \left[ \bullet_0 \right] _{\bullet_0} \right) = M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \curvearrowright \bullet_0 \right) = M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \right) \curvearrowright M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \right) =\left( \bullet_0 +v_0\right) \curvearrowright \left( \bullet_0 +v_0\right).
\]
%\[
%M_{v}\left( \left[ \bullet_0 \right] _{0} \right) = M_{v}\left( \pi_{\BB}\left( \bullet_0 \star \bullet_0 \right) \right) =M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \curvearrowright \bullet_0 \right) = M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \right) \curvearrowright M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \right) =\pi _{\mathcal{B}}\left( \left( \bullet_0 +v_0\right) \star \left( \bullet_0 +v_0\right) \right).
%\]
Since $M_{v}$ is in addition an algebra morphism w.r.t. $\star$ we have
\[
\left( \bullet_0 +v_0\right) \star \left( \bullet_0 +v_0\right) =\left( M_{v}\bullet_0 \right) \star \left( M_{v}\bullet_0 \right) = M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \star \bullet_0 \right) = M_{v}\left( 2\bullet_0 \bullet_0 +\left[ \bullet_0 \right]_{\bullet_0}\right) 
\]
from which we can uniquely determine $M_{v}\left( \bullet_0 \bullet_0 \right) $.
\end{example}

As in the previous section, we shall often be concerned with the case that $v_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\ldots, d$ and $v_0$ takes a special form. We again make precise whenever such a condition is in place by writing, for example, $v = v_0 \in \BB^N(\R^{d})$.

%In the sequel, we shall primarily be concerned with the case $v_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\ldots, d$, and that $v_0 \in \BB^N(\R^d)$ for some integer $N \geq 1$, i.e., $v_0$ contains neither trees with the label $0$ nor trees with more than $N$ nodes. We shall make precise whenever this condition is in place by writing $v = v_0 \in \BB^N(\R^d)$.

We observe the following immediate properties of $M_v$, analogous to those of $T_v$:

\begin{itemize}
\item Since $M_v$ is an algebra morphism which preserves the Lie algebra $\BB^*$, it holds that $M_v$ maps $\GG$ into $\GG$;

\item $M_v \circ M_u = M_{v + M_v(u)}$, where we write $M_v(u) = (M_v(u_0),\ldots, M_v(u_d))$. In particular, $M_{v+u} = M_{v} \circ M_u$ for all $v = v_0,u = u_0 \in \BB^*(\R^d)$;
%which do not contain trees with a vertex labelled by $0$;

\item For every integer $N \geq 0$, $M_v$ induces a well-defined algebra morphism $M_v^N : \BPrimal^N \mapsto \BPrimal^N$, which maps $\GG^N$ into $\GG^N$;

\item Recall the embedding $\imath : \GDual \mapsto \BDual$ from~\eqref{eq:tensorForestEmbed}. Then for all $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d) \subset \LL^*$, it holds that $M_{\imath(v)} \circ \imath = \imath \circ T_v$ (as both are morphisms from $\GDual$ to $\BDual$ which agree on $e_0,\ldots, e_d$).
\end{itemize}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:HopfMorphBranched}
The map $M_v : \BDual \mapsto \BDual$ is a Hopf algebra morphism.
\end{lemma}


\begin{remark}
We note that in the following proof, we only use the fact that $M_v$ is an algebra morphism from $\BDual$ to itself which preserves the space of primitive elements $\BB^*$, and so do not directly use the fact that $M_v$ preserves the pre-Lie product of $\BB^*$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
By construction, $M_v$ respects the product $\star$ of $\BDual$.
To show that the maps $(M_v\otimes M_v) \Delta_\poly$ and $\Delta_\poly M_v$ agree, note that it suffices to show they agree in $\HH$. In turn, their restrictions to $\HH$ are algebra morphisms $(\HH,\star) \mapsto (\HH^*,\star)$, and, since $(\HH,\star)$ is the universal enveloping algebra of its space of primitive elements $\BB$ by the Milnor-Moore theorem, it suffices to show that
\[
(M_v\otimes M_v)\Delta_\poly \tau = \Delta_\poly M_v \tau, \; \; \forall \tau \in \BB.
\]
But this is immediate since $M_v$ maps $\BB^*$ into itself and $M_v(1) = 1$.

We have now shown that $M_v$ is a bialgebra morphism. It now follows from general principles (\cite{Preiss16} Theorem~2.14) that $M_v$ also commutes with the antipode (though this also follows from a direct argument identical to the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:HopfMorph}).
%It remains to show that $M_v$ commutes with the antipode $S$. To this end, we consider the opposite algebra $(\BDual)^{\op}$ (same set and vector space structure as $\BDual$ but with reverse multiplication). Then $S : \HH \mapsto (\BDual)^{\op}$ is an algebra morphism, and again it suffices to check that $S\circ M_v$ and $M_v\circ S$ agree on all $\tau \in \BB^*$, but as before, this is immediate since $M_v \tau \in \BB^*$ and $S(\tau) = -\tau$ for all $\tau \in \BB^*$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Dual action on the Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra $\BPrimal$}  \label{subsec:DualMapBranched}

%{\bf To do:} Write a description of the dual of $M_v$ as for $T^*_v$ in Section~\ref{subsubsec:DualMap}.

As in Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapGeom}, we now wish to describe the dual map $M_v^* : \BPrimal \mapsto \BPrimal$ for which
\[
\gen{M_v x, y} = \gen{x, M_v^* y}, \; \; \forall x \in \BDual, \; \; \forall y \in \BPrimal.
\]
For simplicity, we again consider in detail only the special case $v_i = 0$ for $i=1,\ldots, d$ (but see Remark~\ref{remark:generalBranched} for a description of the general case).

%Denote by $\BB^{(k)}$ the vector space spanned by trees $\tau \in \BB$ consisting of $k$ nodes.

Let $\A$ denote the unital free commutative algebra generated by the trees $\tau \in \BB$. We let $\mathbf{1}$ and $\cdot$ denote the unit element and product of $\A$ respectively. The algebra $\A$ plays here the same role as the algebra $\SSS$ in Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapGeom}.

\begin{remark}
Although the algebras $(\A,\cdot)$ and $(\BPrimal,\poly)$ are isomorphic, they should be thought of as separate spaces and thus we make a clear distinction between the two.
\end{remark}

%\begin{remark}
%The algebra $\A$ plays the same role as the algebra $\SSS$ in Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapGeom}. Note however that the whole space $\bigoplus_{k=1}^\infty (\R^{1+d})^{\tensor k}$ appeared in the definition of $\SSS$, which, by analogy, suggests that $\A$ should be defined as $S(\bigoplus_{k=1}^\infty \HH^{(k)})$. The reason for this difference stems from the fact that $v \in \BB^*$, the significance of which appears in Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv}.
%\end{remark}


For a tree $\tau \in \BB$, we let $D(\tau)$ denote the set of all elements
\[
\tau_1\cdot\ldots \cdot \tau_k \otimes \tilde \tau \in \A \otimes \BB
\]
where $\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_k$ is formed from all non-empty disjoint collections of subtrees of $\tau$ (including subtrees consisting of a single vertex), and $\tilde \tau$ is the tree obtained by contracting every subtree $\tau_i$ to a single node which is then labelled by $0$ (note that $\mathbf{1} \otimes \tau$, corresponding to $k=0$, is also in $D(\tau)$).

Consider the linear map $\extract : \BPrimal \mapsto \A \otimes \BPrimal$ defined for all trees $\tau \in \BB$ by
\[
\extract \tau = \sum_{\tau_1\cdot\ldots\cdot\tau_k \otimes \tilde \tau \in D(\tau)} \tau_1\cdot\ldots\cdot\tau_k \otimes \tilde \tau,
\]
and then extended multiplicatively to all of $\BPrimal$, where we canonically treat $\A\otimes\BPrimal$ as an algebra with multiplication $\MM_{\A\otimes\BPrimal}(\tau_1\otimes\hat{\tau}_1\otimes\tau_2\otimes\hat{\tau}_2):=(\tau_1\cdot\tau_2)\otimes(\hat{\tau}_1\poly\hat{\tau}_2)$ for $\tau_1,\tau_2\in\A$, $\hat{\tau}_1,\hat{\tau}_2\in\BPrimal$.

For example,
\input{DeltatExample}

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:adjointMv}
Let $v = v_0 \in \BB^*$. The dual map $M_v^* : \BPrimal \mapsto  \BPrimal$ is given by
\[
M_v^* \tau = (v \otimes \id)\circ \extract (\tau),
\]
where $v(\tau_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \tau_k) := \gen{\tau_1,v}\ldots\gen{\tau_k, v}$ and $v(\mathbf{1}) := 1$.
\end{proposition}

For the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv}, we require the following combinatorial lemma. We note that similar ``cointeraction'' results appear for closely related algebraic structures in~\cite[Thm 8]{Calaque11}  and~\cite[Thm 5.37]{BHZ16}. We will particularly discuss in further detail the link with the work of~\cite{BHZ16} in Section~\ref{sec:renorm}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:adjointComm}
Let $\curvearrowright^*: \BB \mapsto \BB \otimes \BB$ denote the adjoint of $\curvearrowright$. It holds that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:triangDelta}
(\id \otimes \curvearrowright^*)\extract = \MM_{1,3}(\extract \otimes \extract)\curvearrowright^*,
\end{equation}
where $\MM_{1,3} : \A \otimes \BB \otimes \A \otimes \BB \mapsto \A \otimes \BB \otimes \BB$ is the linear map defined by ${\MM_{1,3}(\tau_1\otimes \tau_2\otimes\tau_3\otimes\tau_4)} = \tau_1\tau_3\otimes \tau_2\otimes\tau_4$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Note that
\[
\curvearrowright^* \tau = \sum_{c} b_c \otimes \tau_c
\]
where the sum runs of all \emph{single} admissible cuts $c$ of $\tau$, and $b_c$ is the branch, $\tau_c$ the trunk of $c$.
Consider a single cut $c$ of $\tau$ across an edge $e$. Let $\tau^c$ denote the sum of the terms of $(\id \otimes \curvearrowright^*)\extract \tau$ obtained by contracting all collections 
of subtrees of $\tau$ which do not contain $e$, followed by a cut (on the second tensor) along the edge $e$ (which necessarily remains). One immediately sees that $\tau^c$ is 
equivalently given by first cutting along $e$, and then contracting along all collections of subtrees of $b_c$ and $\tau_c$, and then grouping the extracted subtrees together, i.e., $\tau^c 
= \MM_{1,3}(\extract \otimes \extract)(b_c\otimes \tau_c)$.
It finally remains to observe that summing over all single cuts $c$ gives~\eqref{eq:triangDelta}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv}]
Denote by
\[
\Phi = (v \otimes \id)\circ \extract : \BB \mapsto \BB.
\]
Since $M_v$ is a Hopf algebra morphism by Lemma~\ref{lem:HopfMorphBranched}, it follows that so is $M_v^*$. In particular, it suffices to show that $\Phi\tau = M_v^* \tau$ for every tree $\tau \in \BB$.

To this end, observe that Lemma~\ref{lem:adjointComm} implies $\curvearrowright^* \Phi = (\Phi \otimes \Phi)\curvearrowright^*$, from which it follows that $\Phi^* : \BB^* \mapsto \BB^*$ is a pre-Lie algebra morphism. Furthermore, for every tree $\tau \in \BB$
\begin{align*}
\forall i \in\{1,\ldots,d\}, \; \; &\gen{\Phi^* \bullet_i, \tau} = \gen{\bullet_i, \Phi \tau} = \gen{\bullet_i, \tau} = \gen{M_v\bullet_i, \tau}; \\
&\gen{\Phi^* \bullet_0, \tau} = \gen{\bullet_0, \Phi \tau} = \gen{\bullet_0, \tau} + \gen{v,\tau} = \gen{M_v\bullet_0, \tau}.
\end{align*}
It follows that $\Phi^*$ is a pre-Lie algebra morphism on $(\BB^*,\curvearrowright)$ which agrees with $M_v$ on the set $\{\bullet_0,\ldots,\bullet_d\} \subset \BB^*$. Hence, by the universal property of $(\BB,\curvearrowright)$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:freePreLie}), $\Phi^*$ agrees with $M_v$ on all of $\BB^*$, which concludes the proof.
\end{proof} 

\begin{remark}\label{remark:generalBranched}
A similar result to Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv} holds for the general case $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d)$. The definition of $\extract$ changes in the obvious way that in the second tensor, instead of replacing every subtree by the node $\bullet_0$, one instead replaces every combination of subtrees by all combinations of $\bullet_i$, $i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}$, while in the first tensor, one marks each extracted subtree $\tau_j$ with the corresponding label $i \in \{0, \ldots, d\}$ that replaced it, which gives $(\tau_j)_i$ (so the left tensor no longer belongs to $\A$ but instead to the free commutative algebra generated by $(\tau)_i$, for all trees $\tau \in \BB$ and labels $i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}$). Finally the term $\gen{\tau_1,v}\ldots\gen{ \tau_k, v}$ would then be replaced by $\gen{(\tau_1)_{i_1}, v_{i_1}}\ldots \gen{(\tau_k)_{i_k}, v_{i_k}}$.
\end{remark}

\section{Examples} \label{sec:Ex}

\subsection{It\^{o}-Stratonovich conversion}\label{subsec:ItoStrat}

As an application of Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv}, we illustrate how to re-express iterated Stratonovich integrals (and products thereof) over some interval $\left[s,t \right] $ as It{\^o} integrals. Consider the $\R^{1+d}$-valued process $B_t = (B^0_t, B^1_t, \ldots, B^d_t)$, where $(B^1_t, \ldots, B^d_t)$ is a standard $\R^d$-valued Brownian motion, and $B^0_t \equiv t$ denotes the time component. Let $\B^{\Strat}$ denote the enhancement of $B_t$ to an $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder branched rough path, $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$, using Stratonovich iterated integrals. For example,  
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau \right\rangle  &=&\underset{%
s<t_{1}<\dots <t_{m}<t}{\int \cdots \int }\circ dB_{t_{1}}^{i_{1}}\circ
\dots \circ dB_{t_{m}}^{i_{m}}   \label{equ:BStr}   \\  
\text{for the linear tree \ }\tau  &=& [\ldots [\bullet_{i_1}]_{\bullet_{i_2}} \ldots ]_{\bullet_{i_m}}, \; \; i_1,\ldots,i_m \in \{0,\ldots, d\},   \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}%
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau \right\rangle 
&=&\int_{s}^{t}B_{u}^{j}B_{u}^{k}\circ dB_{u}^{i} \\
\text{for }\tau  &=&[\bullet_j \bullet_k]_{\bullet_i}, \; \; i,j,k \in \{0,\ldots, d\}.
\end{eqnarray*}%
Similarly, we define $\B^\Ito$ in exactly the same way using It\^{o} integrals.

\begin{remark} In view of the H\"older regularity, only the first $2$ levels of $\B^\Strat$, call this $\B^{(2);\Strat}$, need to be constructed by stochastic integration. The ``full" $T((\R^d))$-valued (geometric) rough paths $\B^\Strat$ is then obtained from $\B^{(2);\Strat}$ via the extension theorem in rough path theory. Strictly speaking, however, one needs to verify that the so supplied rough path, on $[s,t]$ and evaluated against $\tau$, for $|\tau|>2$, agrees a.s. with the object defined by iterated Stratonovich integration in~\eqref{equ:BStr}. This can done by showing $\left\langle \B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau \right\rangle \lesssim |t-s|^{\alpha | \tau |}$ a.s., together with appealing to the uniqueness part of the extension theorem. \footnote{In the geometric rough path case only, one can give an argument based on the fact that the full rough path is the solution to a linear RDE, knowing that solutions to RDEs driven by Stratonovich Brownian rough paths are solutions to the corresponding Stratonovich SDEs. No such argument works in the branched case.}
\end{remark}


For a tree $\tau \in \BB$, recall the definition of $D(\tau) \subset \A \otimes \BB$ from Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapBranched} (which was used to define $\delta$). Consider the subset $\hat D(\tau) \subseteq D(\tau)$ containing $\mathbf{1} \otimes \tau$ and all $\tau_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \tau_k \otimes \tilde \tau \in D(\tau)$ for which $\tau_j \in \{[\bullet_1]_{\bullet_1}, \ldots, [\bullet_d]_{\bullet_d}\}$ for all $1 \leq j \leq k$.

\begin{proposition}
For every tree $\tau \in \BB$ it holds that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ItoStratConv}
\gen{\B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau} = \sum_{\tau_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \tau_k \otimes \tilde \tau \in \hat D(\tau)} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{k} \gen{\B^\Ito_{s,t}, \tilde \tau}.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Consider the sum of linear trees $v = v_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^d [\bullet_{i}]_{\bullet_i} \in \BB^2(\R^d)$. One can readily verify that $\B^\Strat = M_v(\B^\Ito)$, understood in the pointwise sense $\B^\Strat_{s,t} = M_v(\B^\Ito_{s,t})$. Indeed, both $\B^\Strat $ and $M_v(\B^\Ito)$ are a.s. ``full" $\alpha$-H\"older rough path, where this fact - in the case of $M_v(\B^\Ito)$ - either requires an (easy) check by hand, or an appeal to Theorem \ref{thm:transRPs}, (ii), below. Since, by construction, both agree on the first two levels, and $\alpha \in (1/2,1/3)$, we see that $\B^\Strat $ and $M_v(\B^\Ito)$ must be equal, a.s., thanks to the uniqueness part of the extension theorem. 

It then follows by Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv} that
\[
\gen{\B^\Strat_{s,t}, \tau} = \gen{\B^\Ito_{s,t}, M_v^* \tau} = \sum_{\tau_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \tau_k \otimes \tilde \tau \in D(\tau)} \gen{\B^\Ito_{s,t}, \gen{v,\tau_1}\ldots \gen{v,\tau_k} \tilde \tau}.
\]
Since $\gen{v,\mathbf{1}} = 1$, while $\gen{v, \tau_j} = 1/2$ if $\tau_j \in \{[\bullet_1]_{\bullet_1}, \ldots, [\bullet_d]_{\bullet_d}\}$ and zero otherwise, we obtain precisely~\eqref{eq:ItoStratConv}.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Consider the case $\tau =[\bullet_j \bullet_k]_{\bullet_i}$ so that%
\[
\gen{\B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau} =\int_{s}^{t} B_{u}^{j}B_{u}^{k}\circ dB_{u}^{i}.
\]
Recalling the definition of $\hat D(\tau)$ and the explicit form of $\extract \tau$ in~\eqref{eq:deltaExample}, we see that if $i$ is distinct from both $j,k$, then only $\mathbf{1}\otimes \tau$ remains in $\hat D(\tau)$, and so (in trivial agreement with stochastic calculus)
\[
\gen{\B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau} = \gen{\B^\Ito_{s,t},\tau}.
\]
On the other hand,if $i=j\neq k$, an
additional term $[\bullet_i]_{\bullet_i} \otimes [\bullet_k]_{\bullet_0}$ appears in $\hat D(\tau)$, and so
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gen{ \B^\Strat_{s,t},\tau} &=& \gen{\B^\Ito_{s,t},\tau} +\frac{1}{2} \underset{s<t_{1}<t_{2}<t}{\int \int }%
dB_{t_{1}}^{k}dB_{t_{2}}^{0} \\
&=&\gen{\B^\Ito_{s,t},\tau}  +\frac{1}{2}%
\int_{s}^{t} B_{u}^{k} du.
\end{eqnarray*}%
The case $i=k\neq j$ is identical. At last, in the case $i=j=k$, looking at $\extract \tau $ shows that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gen{\B^\Strat,\tau }  &=& \gen{\B^\Ito,\tau } +\frac{1}{2}\underset{s<t_{1}<t_{2}<t}{\int \int } dB_{t_{1}}^{i}dB_{t_{2}}^{0}+\frac{1}{2}\underset{s<t_{1}<t_{2}<t}{\int \int 
}dB_{t_{1}}^{i}dB_{t_{2}}^{0} \\
&=& \gen{ \B^\Ito,\tau } +\int_{s}^{t} B_{u}^{i} du.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
When $\tau = [\ldots [\bullet_{i_1}]_{\bullet_{i_2}}\ldots ]_{\bullet_{i_m}}$ is a linear tree, this is in agreement with~\cite{BenArous89} Proposition 1. In fact, by considering general semi-martingales $X^1_t,\ldots, X^d_t$ and adding extra labels $\bullet_{i,j}$, $1 \leq i \leq j \leq d$ (thus increasing the underlying dimension from $d$ to $d + d(d+1)/2$) to encode the quadratic variants $[X_i,X_j]$, the above procedure (in the more general setting with elements $v_{ij} = [\bullet_i]_{\bullet_j} \in \BB^2(\R^d)$, see Remark~\ref{remark:generalBranched}), immediately provides an It{\^o}-Stratonovich conversion formula for general semi-martingales.
\end{remark}

\subsection{L\'evy rough paths} \label{sec:levy}

Note that the example in the previous section can be viewed as follows: $\B^\Ito$ and $\B^{\Strat}$ are both $\GG^2$-valued L{\'e}vy processes which are branched $p$-rough paths, $2 < p < 3$, and one can recover the signature of one from the other by a suitable (deterministic) translation map $M_v : \GG \mapsto \GG$. We now consider a generalisation of this setting to arbitrary $\GG^N$-valued L{\'e}vy processes, which have already been studied in the context of rough paths in~\cite{FrizShekhar14, Chevyrev15}.

%Consider a $\GG^N$-valued L{\'e}vy process $\Xbf$ with a diffusion on level-$2$, a single drift in the zero-th direction (representing time), and (for simplicity) without jumps. More specifically,

Let $\tau_1,\ldots, \tau_m$ be a basis for $\BB^N$ consisting of trees, which we identify with left-invariant vector fields on $\GG^N$, where we suppose for convenience that $\tau_1 = \bullet_0$.
%We define the degree $d_i = \deg(\tau_i)$ as the number of nodes in $\tau_i$,
Recall that $\GG^N$ is a homogenous group in the sense of~\cite{FollandStein82} (cf.~\cite{HairerKelly15} Remark~2.15).

Recall that to every (left) L{\'e}vy process $\Xbf$ in $\GG^N$ without jumps and with identity starting point (i.e., $\Xbf_0 = 1_{\GG^N}$  a.s.) there is an associated L{\'e}vy triplet $(A,B,0)$, where $B = \sum_{i=1}^m B^i \tau_i$ is an element of $\BB^N$ and $(A^{i,j})_{i,j=1}^m$ is a correlation matrix. Then the generator of $\Xbf$ is given for all $f \in C^2_0(\GG^N)$ by (see, e.g., \cite{Liao04})
\[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} t^{-1}\EEE{f(x\star\Xbf_t) - f(x)} = \sum_{i=1}^m B^i (\tau_i f) (x) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^m A^{i,j} (\tau_i\tau_j f)(x).
\]
%A necessary and sufficient condition for $\Xbf$ to have finite $p$-variation for all $N < p < N+1$ is that $A^{i,i} = 0$ whenever $\tau_i$ has more than $\floor{N/2}$ nodes.

\begin{remark}
We have assumed here that $\Xbf$ is without jumps only for simplicty. Indeed, one can treat any $\GG^N$-valued c{\`a}dl{\`a}g process $\Xbf$ of finite $p$-variation (in th rough path sense) as a branched $p$-rough path (albeit in general non-canonically) using the notion of a path function~\cite{Chevyrev15}.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:LevyTriplet}
Let $M : \HH^N \mapsto \HH^N$ be an algebra morphism which preserves $\GG^N$ and $\Xbf$ a L{\'e}vy process in $\GG^N$ with L{\'e}vy triplet $(A,B,0)$.

Then $M(\Xbf)$ is the (unique in law) $\GG^N$-valued (left) L{\'e}vy process with generator given for all $f \in C^2_0(\GG^N)$ by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LevyGen}
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} t^{-1}\EEE{f(x \star M\Xbf_t) - f(x)} = \sum_{i=1}^m B^i (M\tau_i f) (x) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^m A^{i,j} (M\tau_i M\tau_j f)(x).
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
The fact that $M\Xbf$ is a L{\'e}vy process is immediate from the fact that $\Xbf$ is a L{\'e}vy process and that $M : \GG^N \mapsto \GG^N$ is a (continuous) group morphism. It thus only remains to show~\eqref{eq:LevyGen}, where we may suppose without loss of generality that $x=1_{\GG^N}$. To this end, define $h = f\circ M$ and observe that
\[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} t^{-1}\EEE{f(M\Xbf_t) - f(1_{\GG^N})} = \sum_{i=1}^m B^i (\tau_i h)(1_{\GG^N}) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^m A^{i,j} (\tau_i\tau_j h)(1_{\GG^N})
\]
(note that in general $h$ might fail to decay at infinity and thus not be an element of $C^2_0(\GG^N)$, however the above limit is readily justified by taking suitable approximations). Using the fact that $(\tau h)(x) = \frac{d}{dt} h(x\star e^{t\tau})\mid_{t=0}$, one can easily verify that for all $\sigma,\tau \in \BB^N$ and $x \in \GG^N$
\begin{align*}
(\tau h)(x) &= (M\tau f)(Mx), \\
(\sigma \tau h)(x) &= ((M\sigma) (M \tau) f )(Mx),
\end{align*}
from which~\eqref{eq:LevyGen} follows.
%
%Note that for every $\tau \in \BB^N$
%\begin{align*}
%(\tau h)(x) &= \frac{d}{dt} h(x\star e^{t\tau})\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= \frac{d}{dt} f(M(x \star e^{t\tau}))\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= \frac{d}{dt} f(M(x)\star e^{t M\tau})\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= (M\tau f)(M(x)),
%\end{align*}
%and then for every $\sigma \in \BB^N$
%\begin{align*}
%(\sigma \tau h)(x) &= \frac{d}{dt} (\tau h)(x\star e^{t\sigma})\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= \frac{d}{dt} (\tau h)(x\star e^{t\sigma})\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= \frac{d}{dt} (M\tau f)(M (x\star e^{t\sigma}))\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= \frac{d}{dt} (M\tau f)(M(x)\star e^{tM\sigma}))\mid_{t=0} \\
%&= ((M\sigma) (M \tau) f )(Mx).
%\end{align*}
\end{proof}

We now specialise to the case that $(A^{i,j})_{i,j=1}^m$ is a correlation matrix for which $A^{i,i} = 0$ whenever $\tau_i$ has more than $\floor{N/2}$ nodes, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the sample paths of $\Xbf$ to a.s. have finite $p$-variation for all $N < p < N+1$~\cite{Chevyrev15}. Assume also that $A^{i,i} = 0$ whenever $\tau_i$ contains a node with label $0$, and that $B = \tau_1 = \bullet_0$, so that for all $f \in C^2_0(\GG^N)$
\[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} t^{-1}\EEE{f(x\star\Xbf_t) - f(x)} = (\tau_1 f) (x) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^m A^{i,j} (\tau_i\tau_j f)(x).
\]
The drift term $(\tau_1 f) (x)$ should be interpreted as the time component of the branched rough path $\Xbf$ (which also explains the zero-diffusion condition in  the direction of trees with a label $0$).


Any other $\GG^N$-valued L{\'e}vy process $\tilde \Xbf$ without jumps and the same correlation matrix $(A^{i,j})_{i,j=1}^m$ is also a branched $p$-rough, and its generator differs from that of $\Xbf$ only by a drift term. As a consequence of Lemma~\ref{lem:LevyTriplet}, we see that every such $\tilde \Xbf$ can be constructed by applying a (deterministic) translation map $M_v$ to $\Xbf$. In particular, the full signature of $\tilde \Xbf$ can be recovered from that of $\Xbf$, generalising the example from Section~\ref{subsec:ItoStrat}.


\begin{corollary}
Let $v = v_0 \in \BB^N$ and $M_v : \HH^N \mapsto \HH^N$ the truncation of the translation map from Section~\ref{subsubsec:TransBranched}.

Then $M_v(\Xbf)$ is the (unique in law) $\GG^N$-valued (left) L{\'e}vy process with generator given for all $f \in C^2_0(\GG^N)$ by
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} t^{-1}\EEE{f(x \star M_v(\Xbf_t)) - f(x)} = (\bullet_0 + v) f (x) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^m A^{i,j} (\tau_i\tau_j f)(x).
\end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
%Observe that the only property of the algebra morphism $M_v : \HH^N \mapsto \HH^N$ used in 
The statement of the corollary likewise holds for every algebra morphism $M : \HH^N \mapsto \HH^N$ satisfying $M\bullet_0 = \bullet_0 + v$ and $M\tau = \tau$ for all forests $\tau \in \HH^N$ without a label $0$, which is a manifestation of the final point of the upcoming Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs}~\ref{point:trans2}.

\section{Rough differential equations} \label{sec:RDE}

\subsection{Translated rough paths are rough paths}

We now show that the maps $T_v$ and $M_v$ act on the spaces of weakly geometric and branched rough paths. Throughout, we regard these rough paths as fully lifted, as can always (and uniquely) be done thanks to the extension theorem. The action of our translation operator is then pointwise, i.e.
$$
                                  (M_v\mathbf{X})_{s,t} := M_v (\mathbf{X}_{s,t}),
$$
and similarly for the geometric rough path translation operator $T$.  In the following, we let $|w|$ denotes the length of a word $w \in T(\R^{1+d})$ (resp. number of nodes in a forest $w \in \BPrimal$), and equip the space of $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder weakly geometric (resp. branched) rough paths with the inhomogeneous H{\"o}lder norm
\[
\norm{\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha};[s,t]} =  \max_{|w| \leq \floor{1/\alpha}} \sup_{u \neq v \in [s,t]}\frac{|\gen{\mathbf{X}_{u,v},w}|}{|v-u|^{|w|\alpha}},
\]
where the max runs over all words $w \in T(\R^{1+d})$ (resp. forests $w \in \BPrimal$) with $|w| \leq \floor{1/\alpha}$.
%(\cite{HairerKelly15} Section~2.4, \cite{FrizVictoir10} Section~8.1.2).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:transRPs}

Let $\alpha \in (0,1]$ and $\mathbf{X}$ a $\alpha$-H{\"older} weakly geometric (resp. branched) rough path over $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$

\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape(\roman*\upshape)]
\item \label{point:trans1} Let $v = \left(v_{0},v_1\ldots, v_d \right)$ be a collection of elements in $\LL^N(\R^{1+d})$ (resp. in $\BB^N$).

Then $T_v\mathbf{X}$ (resp. $M_v \mathbf{X}$) is a $\alpha/N$-H{\"older} weakly geometric (resp. branched) rough path satisfying
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HolLipNorm}
\norm{T_v\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha/N};[s,t]} \textnormal{ (resp. $\norm{M_v\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha/N};[s,t]}$) } \leq C_v \norm{\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha};[s,t]}
%:= C_v \max_{|w| \leq N} \sup_{u \neq v \in [s,t]}\frac{|\gen{\mathbf{X}_{u,v},w}|}{|v-u|^{|w|}},
\end{equation}
for a constant $C_v$ depending polynomially on $v$.

\item \label{point:trans2} Let $v= \left( v_{0},0,\dots 0\right)$ for $v_{0}\in \LL^{N}\left( \mathbb{R}^{1+d}\right) $ (resp. $v_{0}\in \BB^N$). Suppose that $\mathbf{X}$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mixedVar}
\norm{\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{(1,\alpha)};[s,t]} := \max_{|w| \leq \floor{1/\alpha}} \sup_{u \neq v \in [s,t]} \frac{|\gen{\mathbf{X}_{u,v}, w}|}{|v-u|^{(1-\alpha)|w|_0 + \alpha|w|}} < \infty,
\end{equation}
where the $\max$ runs over all words $w \in T(\R^{1+d})$ (resp. forests $w \in \BPrimal$) with $|w| \leq \floor{1/\alpha}$ and $|w|_0$ denotes the number of times the letter $e_0$ (resp. label $0$) appears in $w$.

Then $T_{v}\mathbf{X}$ (resp. $M_v\mathbf{X}$) is a $\alpha \wedge (1/N)$-H{\"older} weakly geometric (resp. branched) rough path over $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ satisfying
\[
\norm{T_v\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha \wedge (1/N)};[s,t]} \textnormal{ (resp. $\norm{M_v\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha \wedge (1/N)};[s,t]}$) } \leq C_v \norm{\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{(1,\alpha)};[s,t]}
\]
for a constant $C_v$ depending polynomially on $v$.

Finally, in the setting of branched rough paths, let $M : \HH^* \mapsto \HH^*$ be any algebra morphism which preserves $\GG$ and such that $M \tau = \tau$ for every forest $\tau\in \HH$ without a label $0$, and $M\bullet_0 = M_v\bullet_0 = \bullet_0 + v_0$. Then $M \mathbf{X} = M_v \mathbf{X}$.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{theorem}

Before the proof of the theorem, several remarks are in order.

\begin{remark}
In Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs} we treat $\alpha$-H{\"older} weakly geometric rough paths as already enhanced with their iterated integrals. Thus $\mathbf{X}_{s,t}$ is an element of $T((\R^{1+d}))$ and $(T_v\mathbf{X})_{s,t}$ is just the image of $\mathbf{X}_{s,t}$ under $T_v$. Therefore the statement of the proposition is that not only does $(T_v\mathbf{X})_{s,t}$ have the correct regularity on the first $n=\floor{1/\alpha}$ levels to qualify as a rough path but that all further iterated integrals are already given, in a purely algebraic way, by $(T_v\mathbf{X})$. That said, if one takes the level-$n$ view, writing $\pi_{n} ( T_v\mathbf{X})$ for the translation only defined as a level-$n$ rough path, the extension theorem asserts that there is a unique full rough path lift, say $\mathbf{Z}$. But then, by the uniqueness part of the extension theorem, $\mathbf{Z} = T_v\mathbf{X}$ so that our construction is compatible with the rough path extension.

The same remark applies to branched rough paths, where we recall that, as a particular consequence of the sewing lemma, every $\alpha$-H{\"older} branched rough paths admits a unique lift (extension) to all of $\BDual$ (\cite{Gubinelli10} Theorem~7.3, or~\cite{HairerKelly15} p.223). We would also like to point out that Boedihardjo~\cite{Boedihardjo15} recently extended a result on the factorial decay of lifts of geometric rough paths (first shown in~\cite{Lyons98}) to the branched setting, answering a conjecture in~\cite{Gubinelli10}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
In the case of geometric rough paths the previous remark points to an alternative (analytic) construction of the translation operator, first defined on a smooth path $X$ identified with its full lift $X \equiv (1,X^1,X^2, ...)$,  and subsequently extended to geometric rough paths by continuity. We stick to the case of one Lie polynomial $v_0 = v = (v^1,v^2,...v^N)$ which we want to add at constant speed to $X$. At level $1$, obviously $(T_v X)^1_{s,t} = X^1_{s,t} + (t-s) v^1$ and $(T_v X)$ is a Lipschitz path (a $1$-rough path). We then perturb the canonically obtained (extended) $2$-rough path which in turn we can perturb on the second level by adding $(t-s) v^2$, thereby obtaining a (non-canonical) $2$-rough path. Iterating this construction allows us to ``feed in, level-by-level'' the perturbation $v$ until we arrive at a rough path $T_v\mathbf{X}$ with regularity $\Hol \alpha \wedge (1/N)$. We leave it to the reader to check that this construction yields indeed $T_v\mathbf{X}$. The downside of this construction is its restricted to geometric rough paths, not to mention its repeated use of the (analytic) extension theorem, in a situation that is within reach of purely algebraic methods. 
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}\label{remark:colifting}
The condition~\eqref{eq:mixedVar} on $\mathbf{X}$ is very natural and arises by ``colifting'' a Lipschitz path $X^0$ with a $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder weakly geometric rough path. Moreover, this is a special case of a weakly geometric $(p,q)$-rough path (see~\cite{FrizVictoir10} Section~9.4), and the statement can readily be extended to this general setting.
%as well as to the setting of $p$-variation (as opposed to H{\"o}lder) rough paths.
One can also make a statement about the continuity of the maps $(v,\mathbf{X}) \mapsto T_v\mathbf{X}$ and $(v,\mathbf{X}) \mapsto M_v\mathbf{X}$ in suitable rough path topologies. However these points will not be explored here further.
%As this is not our main goal however, we do not explore these points further.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:algMorphs}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs} part~\ref{point:trans1} will reveal that the only properties required of $T_v$ (resp. $M_v$) is that it be an algebra morphism, preserves group-like (or equivalently primitive) elements, is upper-triangular (increases grading), and that it increases the grade of every word of length $k$ (resp. forest with $k$ nodes) to at most $Nk$. While already the first of these conditions uniquely determines $T_v$ once $T_v (e_i) = e_i + v_i$ is chosen, we emphasise that without demanding that $M_v$ is a pre-Lie algebra morphism, there is freedom to how $M_v$ can be extended to satisfy these properties even after $M_v(\bullet_i) = \bullet_i + v_i$ is chosen.

In general, different choices of $M_v$ will give rise to different branched rough paths $M_v(\mathbf{X})$. There is a notable exception to this, which is when $\mathbf{X}$ is the canonical lift of a Lipschitz (or more generally $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder, $\alpha \in (1/2,1]$) path in $\R^{1+d}$. Then for every algebra morphism $M : \HH^* \mapsto \HH^*$ such that $M \bullet_i = M_v \bullet_i = \bullet_i + v_i$, it holds that $M \mathbf{X} = M_v \mathbf{X}$. Indeed, in this case $\mathbf{X}$ is necessarily in the image of $G(\R^{1+d}) \subset T((\R^{1+d}))$ under the embedding~\eqref{eq:tensorForestEmbed}, and since $M$ and $M_v$ agree on the generators $\bullet_i$, it follows that $M\mathbf{X} = M_v \mathbf{X}$ (this discussion relates of course to the final point of Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs} part~\ref{point:trans2}, where upon demanding additional structure on $\mathbf{X}$, we see that all maps $M$ satisfying the specified properties agree on $\mathbf{X}$).
\end{remark}



\begin{remark}\label{remark:BCF}
In~\cite{BCFForth}, two examples are studied of families of random bounded variation paths $(X^\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon > 0}$ whose canonical lifts to geometric rough paths $(\mathbf{X}^\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon > 0}$ diverge as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. In particular, ODEs driven by $X^\varepsilon$ in general also fail to converge. However, for suitably chosen $v^\varepsilon = v^\varepsilon_0 \in \LL^N(\R^{d})$, for which in general $\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0}|v^\varepsilon| = \infty$, one obtains convergence of the translated rough paths $T_{v^\varepsilon}\mathbf{X}^\varepsilon$. In particular, it follows from the upcoming Theorem~\ref{thm:transRDEs} that solutions to modified ODEs driven by $X^\varepsilon$, with terms generally diverging as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, converge to well-defined limits. In this specific context, the translation maps $T_{v^\varepsilon}$ are precisely the renormalization maps occurring in regularity structures when applied to the setting of SDEs; we shall make this connection precise in Section~\ref{sec:renorm}.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
Observe that the level-$N$ lift of a weakly geometric rough path is precisely the solution to the linear RDE
\[
dY_t = L(Y_t)d\mathbf{X}_t, \; \; Y_0 = 1 \in T^N(\R^{1+d}),
\]
where $L = (L_0,\ldots,L_d)$ are the linear vector fields on $T^N(\R^{1+d})$ given by right-multiplication by $(e_0,\ldots, e_d)$ respectively.
In much the same way, the level-$N$ truncation of the translated path $Y_t := \pi_N(T_v\mathbf{X}_t)$ is the solution to the modified linear RDE 
\[
dY_t = L^v(Y_t) d\mathbf{X}_t, \; \; Y_0 = 1 \in T^N(\R^{1+d}),
\]
where now $L^v = (L_{e_0 + v_0},\ldots,L_{e_d + v_d})$ are given by right-multiplication by $(e_0 + v_0,\ldots, e_d + v_d)$ (which is a special case of the upcoming Theorem~\ref{thm:transRDEs}).

We note however that the same conclusion does not hold for branched rough paths. Indeed, even the level-$N$ lift of a branched rough path $\mathbf{X}$, $N \geq \floor{1/\alpha}$, is in general not the solution of a linear RDE driven by $\mathbf{X}$, which can easily be seen from the fact that linear RDEs are completely determined by the values $\gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}, \tau}$ where $\tau$ ranges over all linear trees $\tau = [\ldots[\bullet_{i_1}]_{\bullet_{i_2}}\ldots]_{\bullet_{i_m}}$ (see, e.g., \cite{HairerKelly15} Example~3.11). A simple example is any branched rough path $\mathbf{X}$ for which $\gen{\mathbf{X}, \tau} \equiv 0$ for all linear trees $\tau$ (e.g., the $\frac{1}{3}$-H{\"o}lder branched rough path for which $\gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}, \tau} = t-s$ for some $\tau = [\bullet_i\bullet_j]_{\bullet_k}$ and zero for every other tree $\tau$ of size $|\tau| \leq 3$), so that every linear RDE driven by $\mathbf{X}$ is constant.
\end{remark}



\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs}]
\ref{point:trans1} We are required to show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T_v \mathbf{X}$ takes values in $G(\R^{1+d})$,

\item Chen's relation $(T_v \mathbf{X})_{s,t} \tensor (T_v \mathbf{X})_{t,u} = (T_v \mathbf{X})_{s,u}$ holds, and

\item the analytic condition~\eqref{eq:HolLipNorm}.
\end{enumerate}
The first two properties follow immediately from the analogous properties of $\mathbf{X}$ and the fact that $\restr{T_v}{G(\R^{1+d})} : G(\R^{1+d}) \mapsto G(\R^{1+d})$ is group morphism. To verify the final property, fix a word $w \in T(\R^{1+d})$. It readily follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointTv} and Remark~\ref{remark:generalGeom} that $T_v^*w = \sum_i \lambda_i w_i$ where $\lambda_i \in \R$ and $w_i$ is a word which satisfies $N|w_i| \geq |w|$. However
%Since $X$ is a Lipschitz path, we have
\[
|\gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}, w_i}| \leq \norm{\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha};[s,t]}|t-s|^{\alpha|w_i|},
\]
and thus
\[
|\gen{(T_v\mathbf{X})_{s,t}, w}| = |\gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}, T_v^*w}| \leq C\norm{\mathbf{X}}_{\Hol{\alpha};[s,t]} |t-s|^{\alpha|w|/N}
\]
with $C$ depending only on $w$ and (polynomially) on $v$. It follows that $T_v\mathbf{X}$ is indeed a $\alpha/N$-H{\"o}lder rough path, and the desired estimate~\eqref{eq:HolLipNorm} follows by running over all $w$ with $|w|\leq \floor{N/\alpha}$. The proof for the case of branched rough paths is identical, using now Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointMv}.

The proof of the first statement of~\ref{point:trans2} is virtually the same, except we now observe that Proposition~\ref{prop:adjointTv} and the condition $v = v_0 \in \LL^N(\R^{1+d})$ imply that $T_v^*w = \sum_{i} \lambda_i w_i$ where $\lambda_i \in \R$ and $w_i$ is a word which satisfies
\[
N|w_i|_0 + (|w_i| - |w_i|_0) \geq |w|.
\]
The first statement of~\ref{point:trans2} now follows from~\eqref{eq:mixedVar}, and the proof for the case of branched rough paths is again identical.

To show the last point of~\ref{point:trans2}, consider the subspace $\HH^k(\R^d) \oplus \gen{\bullet_0}\subset \HH^k$ spanned by $\bullet_0$ and all forests $\tau \in \HH^k$ without a label $0$. Observe that it suffices to show that for every $k \geq 0$, the level-$k$ truncation $\pi_k \mathbf{X}$ takes values in the subalgebra of $\HH^k$ generated by $\HH^k(\R^d) \oplus \gen{\bullet_0}$.

To this end, consider the space $\tilde C^{\infty}$ defined as the collection of all piecewise smooth paths $\x : [0,T] \mapsto \GG^k$ for which $\dot{\x} \in \HH^k(\R^d) \oplus \gen{\bullet_0}$ (so that in fact $\dot{\x} \in \BB^k(\R^d) \oplus \gen{\bullet_0}$). For every partition $D = (t_0,\dots, t_m) \subset [0,T]$, we can construct $\x^D \in \tilde C^\infty$ as the piecewise geodesic path (for the Riemannian structure of $\GG^k$) whose increment over $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ is $\exp( \pi_{\BB^k(\R^d) \oplus \gen{\bullet_0}} \log\mathbf{X}_{t_i,t_{i+1}})$. One can verify that condition~\eqref{eq:mixedVar} guarantees that $\x^D \rightarrow \pi_k \mathbf{X}$ uniformly as $|D| \rightarrow 0$. The conclusion now follows since, by construction, $\x^D$ takes values in the subalgebra generated by $\BB^k(\R^d) \oplus \gen{\bullet_0}$.
%$\x^D$ have uniformly bounded $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder norm (cf.~\cite{FrizVictoir10} Proposition~5.20), and furthermore condition~\eqref{eq:mixedVar} guarantees that $\x^D$ converge uniformly to $\pi_k\mathbf{X}$ as $|D| \rightarrow 0$. By an interpolation argument, it follows in particular that $\x^D_T \rightarrow \mathbf{X}$ one can de
\end{proof}



\subsection{Effects of translations on RDEs}\label{subsec:effectsRDEs}

Throughout this section, we assume that $f=\left( f_0, \dots , f_{d}\right)$ is a collection of vector fields on $\R^e$ which are as regular as required for all stated operations and RDEs to make sense.

Observe that $f$ induces a canonical map from $\LL^N(\R^{1+d})$ to the space of vector fields $\Vect(\R^e)$ which extends the map $e_{i}\mapsto f_{i}$. Write $f_{v}$ for the image of $v\in \LL^{N}\left( \mathbb{R}%
^{d}\right)$ under this map, e.g., for $v = \left[ e_{1},e_{2}\right] $, we have the vector
field $f_{\left[ e_{1},e_{2}\right] } \equiv \left[ f_{1},f_{2}\right] $. Given a collection $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d) \subset \LL^N(\R^{1+d})$, we write
\[
f^v = (f^v_0,\ldots, f^v_d) = (f_{e_0 + v_0},\ldots, f_{e_d+v_d}).
\]

Similarly, $f$ induces a canonical map from $\BB^N$ to $\Vect(\R^e)$ which extends $\bullet _{i}\mapsto f_{i}$ using the pre-Lie product $\triangleright$ on $\Vect(\R^e)$ (recall from Example~\ref{example:vectfieldsPreLie} that in coordinates $\left( f^{i}\partial_{i}\right) \triangleright \left( g^{j}\partial _{j}\right) \equiv \left(f^{i}\partial _{i}g^{j}\right) \partial _{j}$). Once more write $f_{v}$ for
the image of $v\in \BB^N$ under this map, e.g., for $v = \left[ \bullet_{1} \right]_{\bullet_2} = \bullet_1 \curvearrowright \bullet_2$, we have the vector field
\[
f_{\bullet _{1}\curvearrowright \bullet _{2}} = f_{\left[ \bullet _{1} \right] _{\bullet_2}} \equiv f_{1}\triangleright f_{2}
\]
(note that our notation $f_v$ agrees with that of~\cite{HairerKelly15} Section~3). Again given a collection $v = (v_0,\ldots, v_d) \subset \BB^N$, we write
\[
f^v = (f^v_0,\ldots, f^v_d) = (f_{\bullet_0 + v_0},\ldots, f_{\bullet_d + v_d}).
\]

\begin{remark}
Treating $\LL^N(\R^{1+d})$ (resp. $\BB^N$) as a nilpotent Lie (resp. pre-Lie) algebra, the map considered above is not in general a Lie (resp. pre-Lie) algebra morphism into $\Vect(\R^e)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:geobranchEmbed}
Since the space of weakly geometric rough paths embeds into the space of branched rough paths using the map~\eqref{eq:tensorForestEmbed}, the statements in Theorem~\ref{thm:transRDEs} for weakly geometric rough paths are a special case of those for branched rough paths. We make a distinction between the two cases only for clarity.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
For clarity, we first prove the statement for geometric rough paths and then generalise to branched rough paths (although by Remark~\ref{remark:geobranchEmbed}, it suffices to prove the statement only in the branched case). 

Observe that for weakly geometric rough paths,~\ref{point:RDE1} will follow directly from the usual Euler RDE estimate (\cite{FrizVictoir10} Corollary~10.15)
%%derived in~\cite{HairerKelly15} Proposition~3.8 
once we show that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:geoEuler}
\sum_{|u| \leq \floor{1/\alpha}} \gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t},u} f^v_u(y) = \sum_{|u| \leq \floor{N/\alpha}} \gen{T_v \mathbf{X}_{s,t}, u} f_u(y) + r_{s,t}, \; \; \forall y \in \R^e, \; \; \forall s,t \in [0,T],
%%\sum_{\tau \in \BB^1} \gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau} f^v_\tau(y) = \sum_{\tau \in \BB^N} \gen{M_v \mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau} f_\tau(y) + r_{s,t}, \; \; \forall y \in \R^e, \; \; \forall s,t \in [0,T],
\end{equation}
where $|r_{s,t}| = o(|t-s|)$ and where the sums run over any orthonormal basis of $\LL^{\floor{1/\alpha}}(\R^{1+d})$ and $\LL^{\floor{N/\alpha}}(\R^{1+d})$ respectively.
%sums run over all trees $\tau$ in $\BB^1$ and $\BB^N$ respectively.

Consider for the moment that $f = (f_0,\ldots, f_d)$ is a collection of smooth vector fields, so that $\Phi_f : u \mapsto f_u$
%\equiv \sum_{w} \gen{x,u}f_\tau$
is a genuine Lie algebra morphism from $\LL(\R^{1+d})$ into $\Vect^\infty(\R^e)$. Hence, whenever $f$ are smooth, the maps $\Phi_f \circ T_v$ and $\Phi_{f^v}$ are both Lie algebra morphisms from $\LL(\R^{1+d})$ into $\Vect^\infty(\R^e)$ which furthermore agree on the generators $e_i$. Thus $\Phi_f \circ T_v = \Phi_{f^v}$, and so
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LieMorph}
\sum_{u} \gen{x,u}f^v_u = \sum_{u} \gen{T_v x,u}f_u, \; \; \forall x \in \LL(\R^{1+d}),
\end{equation}
where both sums run over any orthonormal basis of $\LL(\R^{1+d})$. This proves~\eqref{eq:geoEuler} for smooth $f = (f_0,\ldots, f_d)$. For the general case where $f$ are only sufficiently regular for the stated RDEs to make sense, we note that equality~\eqref{eq:LieMorph} is purely algebraic, so~\eqref{eq:geoEuler} can be readily deduced by truncation.


To extend this argument to the case of branched rough paths, ~\ref{point:RDE1} will follow directly from the Euler estimate derived in~\cite{HairerKelly15} Proposition~3.8 once we show that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Euler}
\sum_{\tau \in \BB^{\floor{1/\alpha}}} \gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau} f^v_\tau(y) = \sum_{\tau \in \BB^{\floor{N/\alpha}}} \gen{M_v \mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau} f_\tau(y) + r_{s,t}, \; \; \forall y \in \R^e, \; \; \forall s,t \in [0,T],
\end{equation}
where $|r_{s,t}| = o(|t-s|)$ and where the sums run over all trees $\tau$ in $\BB^{\floor{1/\alpha}}$ and $\BB^{\floor{N/\alpha}}$ respectively.

As before, suppose first that $f = (f_0,\ldots, f_d)$ is a collection of smooth vector fields, so that $\Phi_f : x \mapsto f_x \equiv \sum_{\tau\in \BB} \gen{x,\tau}f_\tau$ is a pre-Lie algebra morphism from $\BB$ into $\Vect^\infty(\R^e)$. Hence, whenever $f$ are smooth, the maps $\Phi_f \circ M_v$ and $\Phi_{f^v}$ are both pre-Lie algebra morphisms from $\BB$ into $\Vect^\infty(\R^e)$ which furthermore agree on the generators $\bullet_i$. Thus $\Phi_f \circ M_v = \Phi_{f^v}$, and so
\[
\sum_{\tau \in \BB} \gen{x,\tau}f^v_\tau = \sum_{\tau \in \BB} \gen{M_v x,\tau}f_\tau, \; \; \forall x \in \BB.
\]
As the above equality is purely algebraic, we again deduce~\eqref{eq:Euler} by truncation in the general case where $f$ are only sufficiently regular for the stated RDEs to make sense.

The desired result in~\ref{point:RDE2} for both geometric and branched rough paths follows in the same way.
\end{proof}

\section{Link with renormalization in regularity structures}
\label{sec:renorm}

We now recall several notions from the theory of regularity structures and draw a link between the map $\extract$ from Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapBranched} and the coproduct $\Deltam$  associated to negative renormalization~\cite{BHZ16, Hairer16}. In particular, we demonstrate how negative renormalization maps on the regularity structure associated to branched rough paths carry a natural interpretation as rough path translations (see Theorem~\ref{thm:NegRenorm} below).

\subsection{Regularity structures}

{\it Regularity structures usually deal with (e.g. SPDE solutions) $u=u(z)$ where $z \in \R^n$ (e.g. space-time), $u$ takes values in $\R$ (or $\R^e$). Equations further involve a $\beta$-regularizing kernel, and there are $d$ sources of noise, say $\xi_1,...,\xi_d$, of arbitrary (negative) order $\alpha_{\min}$, as long as the equation is subcritical.}

\subsubsection{Generalities}  

{\it We review the general (algebraic) setup in the case $n=1$, $\beta = 1$ and $\alpha_{\min} \in (-1,0)$. }

\medskip

In the spirit of Hairer's formalism, consider the equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RDEEq}
u(t) = u(0) + \left(K * \sum_{i=1}^d f_i(u(\cdot))\xi_i(\cdot) \right)(t), \; \; t \in \R,
\end{equation}
where $u(t)$ is a real-valued function for which we solve, $\xi_i(t)$ are driving noises, $f_i$ are smooth functions on $\R$ (one could readily extend to the case that $u$ takes values in $\R^e$ and $f_i$ are vector fields on $\R^e$), and $K$ is a kernel which improves regularity by order $\beta = 1$.

\begin{remark}
The example to have in mind here is $K(s) = \exp (- \lambda s) 1_{s>0}$, which allows to incorporate an additional linear drift term (``$-\lambda u dt$''), or of course the case 
$\lambda =0$, i.e. the Heaviside step function, which leads to the usual setting of controlled differential equations. We shall indeed specialize to the Heaviside case in subsequent
sections, as this simplifies some algebraic constructions and so provides a clean link to rough path structures. For the time being, however, we find it instructive to work
with a general $1$-regularizing $K$, as this illustrates the need for polynomials decorations as well as symbols $\mathcal{J}_k$, representing $k$-th derivatives of the kernel.
\end{remark}


Our driving noises $\xi_i(t)$ should be treated as distributions on $\R$ of regularity $C^{\alpha-1}$ for some $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ (which will later correspond to the case of $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder branched rough paths). In the case that $\alpha \leq 1/2$, due to the product $f_i(u)\xi_i$,~\eqref{eq:RDEEq} is singular and thus cannot in general be solved analytically. However the equation is evidently sub-critical in the sense of~\cite{Hairer14}, and so one can build an associated regularity structure.

\medskip

{\bf Introducing the symbols} 

\medskip

We first collect all the symbols of the regularity structure required to solve~\eqref{eq:RDEEq} and which is stable under the renormalization maps in the sense of~\cite{BHZ16}.
Define the linear space $$\TT = \gen{\WW},$$
where $\WW$ is the set of all rooted trees where every node carries a decoration $k \in \N \cup \{0\}$ and where every edge which ends on a leaf may be (but is not necessarily) assigned a type $ \mathfrak{t}_{\Xi_i}, $ $i \in \{1,\ldots, d\}$. An edge with type $ i $ corresponds to the driving noise $ \xi_i $. Every other edge has a type $ \mathfrak{t}_{K} $ which means that it is associated to the kernel $ K $. (For now, we only assume $K$ is $1$-regularizing, later we will take it to be the Heaviside step function.) Also, each node has at most one incoming edge with type belonging to $  \{1,\ldots, d\}$.\footnote{This rules out symbols corresponding to products of noise, such as $\Xi_i \Xi_j$ with $i,j \in   \{1,\ldots, d\}$.}

To avoid confusion between the different meaning of trees in $\WW$ and those introduced in Section~\ref{sec:Branched}, we will color every tree in $\WW$ blue. Every such tree has a corresponding symbol representation, e.g.,

\end{equs}
where we implicitly drop the $0$ decoration ($ \leftrightarrow X^0 $) from the nodes. It is instructive to check that $\WW$ provides an example of a structure built from a subcritical complete rule (in the sense of~\cite{BHZ16} Section~5) arising from the equation~\eqref{eq:RDEEq}. Indeed, we can give the set of rules used for the construction of
\begin{equs}
R(\Xi_i) = \lbrace  () \rbrace, \quad R(\II) = \lbrace  ([\II]_{\ell}), ([\II]_{\ell},\Xi_i), \ell \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{ 0 \}, i \in \lbrace 1,...,d \rbrace \rbrace.
\end{equs}
The notation $ [\II]_{\ell} $ is a shorthand notation for $ \II,...,\II $ where $ \II $ is repeated $ \ell $ times.

We define a degree $ |\cdot| $ associated to an edge type and a decorated tree. For edge types and polynomials, we have
\[
 | \Xi_i | =  \alpha-1, \quad | \II | =1, \quad | X^k | = k. 
\]
Then by recursion,
\[
  | \II(\tau) | = | \tau | + |\II|, \quad \left| \prod_i \tau_i \right| = \sum_i |\tau_i| .  
\] 
For a non-recursive definition see~\cite{BHZ16} where the degree is described through a summation over all the edge types and the decorations in the tree.

\begin{remark} Remark that $\WW  \equiv \WW_{\BHZr}$ (the ``r'' in BHZr refers to {\it reduced}, in the terminology of~\cite{BHZ16} these are trees without any extended decorations) will contain certain symbols which do {\it not}  arise if one follows the original procedure of~\cite{Hairer14} (which, in some sense, is the most economical way to build the structure):
$$
     \WW_{\Hai} \subset  \WW_{\BHZr} \subset  \WW_{\BHZ}.
$$
Indeed in~\cite{Hairer14}, the set of rules is not necessarily complete so one has to add terms by hand coming from the renormalization procedure and in the end one works with a space 
$ \bar \WW_{\Hai} $ lying between $ \WW_{\Hai} $ and $ \WW_{\BHZr} $.
For example, $\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)$, $\II (\II (\Xi_k)$, and $\II() \equiv \II(X^0)$ do not appear in $\WW_{\Hai}$, but all of these appear in $\WW_{\BHZr}$. These in turn are embedded in $\WW_{\BHZ}$, a set of trees with extended decorations on the nodes and also colourings of the nodes which give more algebraic properties. In the setting of~\cite{BHZ16}, we would work with an additional symbol $ \one_{\alpha} $ for $ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} $, representing an extended decoration, which provides information on some ``singular'' (negative degree) tree which has been removed, and all of these symbols are would be placed using a complete set of rules.
\end{remark}

{\bf Introducing  $ \TT_- $} 

\medskip

We define the space $ \TT_- $ as 
\begin{equ}[def:Tm]
  \TT_- = \lbrace \tau_1 \bullet \cdots \bullet \tau_n, \; \tau_i \in \WW, \; | \tau_i | < 0\rbrace.
\end{equ}
where $ \bullet $ is the forest product and the unit is given by the empty forest. (In other words,  $\TT_-$ is the free unital commutative algebra generated by elements 
in $\WW$ of negative degree.)
We now recall that $\TT_-$ can be equipped with a Hopf algebra structure $\TT_-$ for which there exists a coaction $\Deltam : \TT \mapsto \TT_- \otimes \TT$ such that $(\TT, \Deltam)$ is a (left) comodule over $\TT_-$. Then the action of a character $\ell \in \TT_-^*$ on $x \in \TT$, termed ``negative renormalization'', is given by $M_\ell x = (\ell\otimes \id)\Deltam x$. 

Following ~\cite{Hairer16} Section~2 we can describe the coaction $\Deltam$ as follows. Fix a tree $\tau \in \WW$, consider
a subforest $A \subset \tau$, i.e., an arbitrary subgraph of $\tau$ which contains
no isolated vertices. We then write $R_A \tau$ for the 
tree obtained by contracting the connected components of $A$ in $\tau$.
With this notation at hand, we then define a linear map, the coaction,  
$$\Deltam \colon  \TT \to \TT_- \otimes  \TT$$ 
by setting, for $\tau \in  \WW$,
\begin{equs}\label{e:Deltabar}
\Deltam \tau &= 
 \sum_{A \subset \TT_-}  A \otimes R_A \tau.
\end{equs}
Unfortunately, this is not quite the correct coaction as it does not handle correctly the powers of $X$. However, upon restriction to $\tilde \TT \subset \TT$, as done in detail in the next section, this is precisely the form of the coaction (now on $\tilde \TT$). When moving to a coproduct this fortunately plays no role (since $\TT_-$ does not contain any non-zero powers of $X$ or a factor of the form $\II()$). By abuse of notation, $\Deltam$ also acts as a coproduct, that is 
\begin{equ} \label{Dmcp}
\Deltam \colon \TT_- \to \TT_- \otimes \TT_-.
\end{equ}
To be explicit, given $f = \tau_1 \cdots \tau_n \in \TT$, we have $\Deltam (f) = \Deltam (\tau_1) ... \Deltam(\tau_n)$ with each $\Deltam (\tau_i)$ as defined above, but with an additional projection to the negative trees on the right-hand side of the tensor-product. 

 \begin{remark} \label{cured_trees}The spaces $ \TT_- \equiv \TT^-_{\BHZr} $, 
 $ \TT^-_{\BHZ} $ and $ \TT^-_{\Hai} $ are the same {\it in this framework} (cf. assumptions from the beginning of this subsection). Indeed, all negative trees of $ \WW $ have a degree of the form $ N \alpha -1 $. Then if we remove one negative subtree, of degree $M \alpha -1 $ say, from a negative tree, we obtain a degree $(N-M)\alpha$ which is positive and hence the ``cured'' tree does not belong to $ \TT_- $. 
 \end{remark}

\medskip
{\bf Introducing  $ \TT_+ $} 
\medskip

In order to describe the space $ \TT_+ $ as in~\cite{BHZ16}, we need to associate to each edge a decoration $ k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace  0 \rbrace $ viewed as a derivation of the kernels or the driving noises. Such a decoration does not appear in $ \TT $. Thus we will replace the letter $ \II $ by $ \JJ $ in this context.  We do not give any graphical notation for $ \JJ_k $, the edge with type $ \mathfrak{t}_{K} $ and decoration $ k $ representing $ K^{(k)} $, because these symbols ultimately will not appear in our context.

%Before introducing the space $ \TT_+ $, we define a degree $ |\cdot| $ associated to an edge type and a decorated tree. For edge types and polynomial, we have
%\[
% | \Xi_i | =  \alpha-1, \quad | \II | =1, \quad | X^k | = k. 
%\]
%Then by recursion,
%\[
%  | \II_k(\tau) | = | \tau | + |\II| - k, \quad \left| \prod_i \tau_i \right| = \sum_i |\tau_i| .  
%\] 
%For a non-recursive definition see~\cite{BHZ16} where the degree is described through a summation over all the edge types and the decorations in the tree.

We define $ \TT_+ $  as the linear span of 
\[
\lbrace  X^k \prod_{i=1}^n  \mathcal{J}_{k_i}(\tau_i) \mid k,n \in \N \cup\{ 0\}, k_i \in \N \cup\{ 0\}, \tau_i \in \WW,\; |\tau_i| + 1 - k_i > 0 \rbrace.
\]
(In other words,  $\TT_+$ is the free unital commutative algebra generated by $\{X\} \cup \{\mathcal{J}_k\tau \mid \tau \in \WW, |\tau|+1-k > 0 \}$).
We use a different letter $ \mathcal{J} $ to stress that $ \WW $ is different from $ \WW^+ $. Moreover, the use of this letter is viewed in~\cite{BHZ16} as a colouration of the root and plays a role in the sequel. We also define the degree of a term
\[
\tau = X^k \prod_{i=1}^n  \mathcal{J}_{k_i}(\tau_i) \in \TT_+, \; \; |\tau| = k + \sum_{i=1}^n 1 - k_i + |\tau_i|.
\]

The space $\TT_+$ is used in the description of the structure group associated to $\TT$. More precisely, recall that $\TT_+$ can be equipped with a Hopf algebra structure for which there exists a coaction $\Deltap: \TT \mapsto \TT \otimes \TT_+$ such that $(\TT, \Deltap)$ is a (right) comodule over $\TT_+$. Following Hairer's survey \cite{Hairer16}, the coaction
\begin{equ}[e:deltapFirst]
\Deltap \colon \TT \to \TT \otimes \TT_+
\end{equ}
is given by 
\begin{equ}[e:deltap1]
\Deltap X_i = X_i \otimes \one + \one \otimes X_i\;,\qquad
\Deltap \Xi_i = \Xi_i \otimes \one\;,
\end{equ}
and then recursively by
\begin{equ}[e:recDelta]
\Deltap \II(\tau) = (\II \otimes \id)\Deltap \tau
+ \sum_{\ell \in \N \cup \{0\}} \frac{X^\ell}{\ell!} \otimes \JJ_{\ell}(\tau)
\end{equ}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DeltapMult}
\Deltap (\tau \bar \tau) = \Deltap \tau\,\Deltap \bar \tau.
\end{equation}
The coproduct $\Deltap: \TT_+ \rightarrow \TT_+ \otimes \TT_+$ is then defined in the same way by replacing~\eqref{e:recDelta} with
\begin{equ}
\Deltap \JJ_k(\tau) = (\JJ_k \otimes \id)\Deltap \tau
+ \sum_{\ell \in \N \cup \{0\}} \frac{X^\ell}{\ell!} \otimes \JJ_{k+\ell}(\tau),
\end{equ}
in which $\Deltap \tau$ is understood as the coaction $\Deltap : \TT \rightarrow \TT\otimes\TT_+$.

Then the action of a character $g \in \TT_+^*$ on $x \in \TT$, termed ``positive renormalization'', is given by $\Gamma_g x = (\id \otimes g)\Deltap x$.

Unfortunately, there is a problem here in that, with definition \eqref{e:recDelta}, a desirable cointeraction between $\Deltap$ and $\Deltam$ fails (see Remark~\ref{cointeraction}). The ``official'' remedy, following \cite{BHZ16}, is to use the extended decorations through another degree $ |\cdot|_+ $ which takes into account these decorations and behaves the same as $ |\cdot| $ for the rest. For example, one has $ | \II(\one_{\beta} \tau) |_+ = | \tau |_++1 + \beta $. The ``correct'' coaction $ \Deltap $ (see \cite[(4.14)]{BHZ16})  then also involves these extended decorations. In the present setting, however, we can get away by replacing~\eqref{e:recDelta} with the same formula, but only keeping $\ell = 0$ in the sum; that is, with $\JJ \equiv \JJ_0$,
\begin{equ}\label{e:recDeltaNew}
\Deltap \II(\tau) = (\II \otimes \id)\Deltap \tau
+ 1 \otimes \JJ(\tau).
\end{equ}

%\begin{remark} \label{rem:costuff}
%{\bf Coaction vs. Coproduct.} We introduce $ \Deltap $ as coaction,
%$ \Deltap : \TT \rightarrow \TT \otimes \TT_+  $. However, also it can be viewed as a coproduct $ \TT_+ \rightarrow \TT_+ \otimes \TT_+ $. The same is true for $ \Deltam $ viewed as a coproduct $ \TT_- \rightarrow \TT_- \otimes \TT_- $. (MAYBE SAY MORE ...) 
%\end{remark}



\begin{remark} The space $ \TT_+ \equiv  \TT^+_{\BHZr} $ depends strongly on the space $ \WW $. We have 
$$
     \TT^+_{\Hai} \subset  \TT^+_{\BHZr} \subset  \TT^+_{\BHZ}.
$$
These two inclusions are Hopf subalgebra inclusions.
Indeed, as proved in~\cite{BHZ16}, the second one, with
 $ \TT_+$ equipped with coproduct $\Deltap$ is a Hopf subalgebra inclusion (with $\Deltap_{\BHZ}$ found in \cite[(4.14)]{BHZ16}). The same is also true for $ \TT^+_{\Hai} $. The key point for the Hopf algebra structure is that, in the terminology of ~\cite{BHZ16}, the symbols defined in \cite{Hairer14} and \cite{BHZ16} are obtained by a ``normal rule'' which guarantees the invariance under $ \Deltap $.
 In the case of $ \TT^{+}_{\BHZ} $, we use  the degree $ | \cdot |_+ $ which is exactly $ |\cdot| $ when we restrict ourselves to $ \TT^{+}_{\BHZr} $. 
\end{remark}



 \begin{remark} \label{cointeraction} The extended decorations are crucial in~\cite{BHZ16} for obtaining a  cointeraction between the two Hopf algebras $ (\TT_+,\Deltap) $ and $ (\TT_-,\Deltam) $:
 \[
  \mathcal{M}^{(13)(2)(4)} \left( \Deltam \otimes \Deltam \right) \Deltap = \left( \id \otimes \Deltap \right) \Deltam
 \]
 where $  \mathcal{M}^{(13)(2)(4)} $ is given as $ \mathcal{M}^{(13)(2)(4)} \left( \tau_1 \otimes \tau_2 \otimes \tau_3 \otimes \tau_4 \right) = \left( \tau_1 \bullet \tau_3 \right) \otimes \tau_2 \otimes \tau_4 $. This identity is both true on $ \TT $ through the comodule structures and on $ \TT_+ $ when the coproduct $ \Deltam $ is viewed as an action on $ \TT_+ $. We have already crossed something similar in Lemma \ref{lem:adjointComm} but in that case the maps involved were not really coproducts. In our simple framework, this property is not satisfied if we just consider the reduced structure. One can circumvent this by changing the coproduct to~\eqref{e:recDeltaNew} as mention above. This approach is possible in our context because we know {\it a priori} that each edge type $ \II $ in the elements of $ \WW$ with negative degree has the same ``Taylor expansion'' of length $ 1 $ in \eqref{e:recDelta} ($ \ell = 0 $). In general, we would use the extended decorations to maintain this property, however, in our setting, we can just fix the length in the coproduct and not use the extended decorations. We follow this approach in the sequel when we restrict ourselves to the rough path setting by choosing the Connes-Kreimer coproduct for $ \Deltap $.  We can also get rid of the colour when we have no derivatives on the edges at the root: if we want to extract from $ \II(\tau_1 \Xi_i)  \II(\tau_2 \Xi_j) $ all the negative subtrees, we observe that it is not possible to extract one at the root, and thus are only left with negative subtrees in $\tau_1 \Xi_i $ and $ \tau_2 \Xi_j $, which ensures that
\[
  M_{\ell}  \II(\tau_1 \Xi_i) \II(\tau_2 \Xi_j)  = \II\left( M_{\ell} \left( \tau_1 \Xi_i\right) \right)  \II\left(   M_{\ell} \left(\tau_2 \Xi_j\right) \right).
\]
In the setting of~\cite{BHZ16}, this multiplicativity property is encoded by a colour at the root which avoids the extraction of a tree containing the root.

%We have used the usual homogeneity $|\tau|$ obtained by weighting $|\Xi_i| = \alpha-1 \in (-1,0)$, $|X^k| = k$, and $|\II| = |\II_0| = 1$.  We will come back to this point in the following section when we identify {\color{red} linear? } $\spn{\WW_-}$ with a subspace of $\BB$, the space spanned by trees introduced in Section~\ref{sec:Branched}.


\subsubsection{The case of rough differential equations} \label{subsubsec:RDEs}


{\it As in the last subsection: $n=1$, $\beta = 1$ and noise degree $\alpha_{\min} \in (-1,0) >-1$. We further specialize the algebraic set in that no symbols $\mathcal{J}_k$ and polynomials $X^k$ with $ k>0$ are required in describing $\TT_+$. }

\medskip

Assuming $K$ to be the Heaviside step function, all derivatives (away from the origin) are zero, hence there is no need (with regard to $\WW$)  to have any polynomial symbols ($X^k$ with $k > 0$). Removing these from $\WW$ leaves us with $\tilde \WW \subset \WW$ which we may list as

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
 \tilde \WW = \{ \Xi_i, ... & , \II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)\Xi_k,  ... , 1, \II(\Xi_i), \II(\Xi_i) \II(\Xi_j), ...  \label{equ:WWap} \\     
&  ... , \II ( \II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)  \Xi_k ), \II (  \II(\Xi_i) \II(\Xi_j)),  ... , \II()\II(), \II(\II()),... \},
\end{split}
\end{align}
(all indices are allowed to vary from $1,...,d$), with associated degrees $| \tau |$ as follows:\footnote{tacitly assuming $\alpha < 1/3$} 
$$
                \alpha -1, ..., 3 \alpha -1, .... , 0, \alpha, 2 \alpha, ... \ ...  , 3 \alpha, 2 \alpha +1 , .... , 2, 2, ...
$$
As in the case of $\WW$, elements of $\tilde \WW$  can be viewed as rooted trees, but {\it without} node decorations. For instance,

\noindent A linear subspace of $ \TT = \gen{ \WW}$ is then given by

{\bf Symbols for negative renormalization}
\medskip

 Recall that, thanks to $\beta =1$, noise degree $\alpha -1 \in (-1,0)$, no terms $X, X^2$ or $\II(), ... $ arise as symbol in $\WW_- := \{\tau \in \WW \mid |\tau| < 0 \}$. (As a consequence, replacing $\WW$ by $\WW_{\Hai}, \tilde \WW$ or $\WW_\mathrm{\BHZ}$ in the definition of the negative symbols makes no difference.) In particular,   
$$
\WW_- = \{ \Xi_i, \II(\Xi_i)\Xi_j,  ... , \II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)\Xi_k,  ... \}.
$$
(where $\WW_-$ ``ends'' right before the element $1$ in \eqref{equ:WWap} above) contains no powers of $ X $, (hence no need to introduce ``$ \tilde{\WW}_- $''). As previously defined (see~\eqref{def:Tm}), we have
$$ \TT_- = \text{free unital commutative algebra generated by }    \WW_-.$$
For instance, writing $\bullet$ for the (free, commutative) product in $\TT_-$,
\[
2 \Xi_i - \frac{1}{3} \Xi_i \bullet \Xi_j + \II(\Xi_i)\Xi_j \bullet ( \II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)\Xi_k)^{\bullet 2} \quad \in \TT_-.
\]
Interpreting $\bullet$ as the {\it forest product}, elements in $\TT_-$ can then be represented as forests, such as
$$
2 \includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.08\textwidth]{txi.png} %
-
\frac{1}{3} \includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.08\textwidth]{txi.png}  \hspace{-0.5cm} \includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.08\textwidth]{txj.png}

$$ 
One can readily verify that $\Deltam : \TT \rightarrow \TT_- \otimes \TT $ restricted to $ \tilde \TT$ maps $\tilde{\TT} \rightarrow \TT_- \otimes \tilde{\TT}  $, also denoted by 
$ \Deltam  $ so that $ (\tilde \TT,\Deltam) $ is a subcomodule of $ (\TT,\Deltam)$. 

\medskip
%\noindent
{\bf Symbols for positive renormalization and $\TT_+$.}
\medskip

Recall that $\TT_+$ was generated, as a free commutative algebra, by 
\[
\WW_+ := \{X\} \cup \{\mathcal{J}_k\tau \mid \tau \in \WW, |\tau|+1-k > 0 \}.
\]
Writing $\mathcal{J} \equiv \mathcal{J}_0$ as usual, we define a subset $\tilde \WW_+ \subset \WW_+$ as follows
\begin{align}
& \tilde \WW_+  := \{ \mathcal{J} \tau \mid \tau \in \tilde \WW  \} \\ \nonumber
& = \{ 1, \JJ(\Xi_i),  \JJ( \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ), \JJ (  \II(  \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) \Xi_k ),  \JJ (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j) \Xi_k), ... ,\JJ (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)), ... \} 
\end{align}
%
%
%
%On the other hand, 
%\[
%\WW_+ := \{X\} \cup \{\II_k\tau \mid \tau \in \WW, |\tau|+1-k > 0\} % = \{X\} \cup \{\II \tau \mid \tau \in \WW, |\tau|+1 > 0\},
%\]
%the subset of symbols in $\WW_+$, which does not contain any non-zero powers of $X^k$, is then given by 
%%mand so, ignoring non-zero powers of $X^k$ we can enlist the symbols as {\color{red} any interesting tree missing ? } 
%\[
%\WW_+ \supset \tilde \WW_+ := \{ 1, \II(\Xi_i),  \II( \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) , \II (  \II(  \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) \Xi_k ),  \II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j) \Xi_k), ... ,\II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)), ... \}
%\]
with degrees $0, \alpha, 2 \alpha, 3 \alpha, 3 \alpha, ..., 2 \alpha + 1,...  $ here. 



Recall that elements in $\WW_+$ can be represented by {\it elementary} trees, in the sense that - disregarding the trivial (empty) tree $1$ - only one edge departs from the root. The same is true for elements in $\tilde \WW_+$. Set

$$\tilde \TT_+ := \text{free unital commutative algebra generated by }    \tilde \WW_+.$$

% certain symbols of negative resp. positive homogeneity.

For example, writing $\tau_1 \tau_2$ for the (free, commutative) product of $\tau_1, \tau_2 \in \tilde \TT_+$, an example of an element in this space would be 
\[
      \JJ ( \II (\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) + 
      \JJ (\II() )  \JJ (1) +
     3 \ \JJ(\Xi_i)  \JJ(\Xi_j)  + \JJ(  \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) \JJ(  \II(\Xi_k) \Xi_l) \quad \in \tilde \TT_+.
\] 
Fortunately, every such element can still be represented as a tree; it suffices to interpret the free product in $\TT_+$ as the ``root-joining'' product
(which is possible since all constituting trees are elementary). The (abstract) unit element $1 \in \TT_+$ is then indeed given by the (trivial) tree ${\color{blue} \bullet} \leftrightarrow X^0$, where we recall our convention to drop the node decoration ``$0$''. For instance, the above element becomes\footnote{Remark that $\JJ (1)$, which corresponds to the right branch of the second term, could also have been written as $\JJ()$, reflecting our convention to drop the decoration $0$ from nodes (here: $1 \equiv X^0$). By the same logic, we could also write $\II()$, one of the symbols arising in $\WW$, as $\II(1)$.}

\[
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.08\textwidth]{tij.png}  + 
\includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.08\textwidth]{tIcIrI.png}  + 
   3 \includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.08\textwidth]{tIiIj.png}  +   \includegraphics[trim=0cm 3mm 0cm 0cm,width=0.12\textwidth]{tijkl.png}      \quad \in \TT_+.
\]

\begin{remark}
Though we used the same formalism to draw trees as in the case of $\tilde \WW$ above, the interpretation here is slighly different in that all root-touching edges refer to $\JJ$ rather than $\II$. As mentioned before, in~\cite{BHZ16}, this is indicated by a blue colouring of the root.
\end{remark} 

%\noindent

As before, we define a coaction of $\tilde \TT_+$ on $\tilde \TT$ (which we again denote $\Deltap : \tilde \TT \rightarrow \tilde \TT\otimes \tilde \TT_+$) by~\eqref{e:deltap1},~\eqref{eq:DeltapMult}, and~\eqref{e:recDeltaNew} as well as a coproduct $\Deltap : \tilde \TT_+ \rightarrow \tilde \TT_+ \otimes \tilde \TT_+$ defined in the same way, but with $\II$ changed to $\JJ$ in~\eqref{e:recDeltaNew}. We note already that $(\tilde \TT_+,\Deltap)$ is isomorphic to the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra $\HH$ arising from the identifications laid out in the following subsection (and which will be used crucially in the proof of the upcoming Proposition~\ref{prop:rosa}).

%NOT TRUE: If we restrict the coproduct $ \Deltap $, as introduced in~\eqref{e:deltapFirst}, from $\TT_+$ to $\tilde{\TT}_+$  then it is isomorphic to the Connes-Kreimer coproduct subject to identifications as given in the next section. Moreover $ (\tilde{\TT}_+,\Deltap) $ is a Hopf subalgebra of $ (\TT_+,\Deltap) $ and $ \tilde{\TT}$ is a subcomodule of $ (\TT,\Deltap) $.


\subsection{Link with translation of rough paths}

\subsubsection{Identification of spaces} 

%We can now give a relation between the map $\Deltam $ and the map $\extract$ . In plain words, applying $\extract$ and forgetting the label $0$ is equivalent to applying $\Deltam$ and annihilating every tree with a non-zero node decoration.

{\it We now give a precise description the map $\Deltam$ in our context as well as its connection to the map $\extract$ from Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapBranched}. To do so, we first need to introduce several identification of vector spaces and algebras, as well as appropriately identify branched rough paths as models on a regularity structure.}

\medskip

Recall the space $\BPrimal = \BPrimal ( \bullet_0, ... , \bullet_d)$ from Section~\ref{sec:Branched} spanned by labelled forests with label set $\{0,1,\ldots, d\}$. Consider now the enlarged vector space 
\begin{equation} 
\tilde \HH :=   \HH \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_1 \oplus ....  \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_d .       \label{def:tHH}
\end{equation}
% (which is the natural regularity structure for RDEs driven by branched rough paths~\cite{Preiss16}).
With $\tilde \TT$ as defined in~\eqref{def:tTT}, we then have a vector space isomorphism 
\[
\tilde \BPrimal \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT
\]
obtained by adding an extra edge to indicate a noise $\Xi_i$, $i \neq 0$, and by ``forgetting'' the label $0$ (which is equivalent to setting the noise $\Xi_0$ to the constant $1$). For example,
\begin{equs}
\tikzexternaldisable  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2,baseline=0.1cm]
        \node at (0,0)  [dot,label= {[label distance=-0.2em]below: \scriptsize  $ 1 $} ] (root) {};

Recall that $\BB = \BB (\bullet_0, ... ,\bullet_d)$  denotes the subspace of $\HH$ spanned by trees, and define
$$\BB_- = \BB_-(\bullet_1, ... ,\bullet_d) \subset \BB \subset \HH $$
as the subspace of $\BB$ spanned by trees with no label $0$ and with at most $\floor{1/\alpha}$ nodes. Observe that there is a vector space isomorphism given by
$$
          \tau \mapsto \phi (\tau) \equiv \dot \tau,
$$          
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BFIsom}
\phi: \BB_- \mapsto \langle \WW_- \rangle    \ \ \subset \ \ \BPrimal \Xi_1 \oplus ....  \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_d  \ \ \subset \ \ \tilde \HH,
\end{equation}
and where we have used the identification $\tilde \HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT \supset \gen{\WW_-}$ for the first inclusion (and both inclusions being strict: for the first, just consider the element 
$
\tikzexternaldisable \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2,baseline=0.1cm]
        \node at (0,0)  [dot,label= {[label distance=-0.2em]below: \scriptsize  $ 0 $} ] (root) {};
         \node at (0,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ 3$}] (right) {};
            \draw[kernel1] (right) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root);
     \end{tikzpicture} \tikzexternaldisable
     \Xi_1 \notin \langle \WW_- \rangle
$). For example,
\begin{equs}
\phi :
\tikzexternaldisable  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2,baseline=0.1cm]
        \node at (0,0)  [dot,label= {[label distance=-0.2em]below: \scriptsize  $ 3 $} ] (root) {};
         \node at (1,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ 2 $}] (right) {};
         \node at (-1,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ 1 $} ] (left) {};
            \draw[kernel1] (right) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root); \draw[kernel1] (left) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root);
     \end{tikzpicture} \tikzexternaldisable
\mapsto \II(\Xi_1)\II(\Xi_2)\Xi_3,
\end{equs}
where we assume $\alpha \in (0,1/3)$ so the tree appearing on the left is indeed an element in $\BB_-$. Correspondingly, the symbol on the right has negative degree as an element of $\WW$, hence is an element of $\WW_-$.

%Combining (\ref{eq:BFIsom}) with the identification $\tilde \HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT$, we see that $\BB_-$ can also be identified with the subspace of $\tilde \TT$ spanned by symbols of negative degree.

Write $\BB_-^*$ for the dual of the (finite-dimensional) vector space $\BB_-$. Of course, $\BB_-^* \cong \BB_-$ which allows us to identify $\BB_-^*$ with $\langle \WW_- \rangle$.
Recall that  $(\TT_-,\bullet)$ was defined as the free unital commutative algebra generated by $\WW_-$, and that $\GG_-\subset \TT_{-}^{* }$  denotes the group of characters on $\TT_-$. By definition of $\TT_-$, we then have a bijection 
\begin{equ} 
\BB_-^* \leftrightarrow \GG_-.   \label{id:BBmGm}
\end{equ} To be fully explicit about this, recall that
$$
      \TT_{-} = \langle \dot \tau_1 \bullet .... \bullet \dot \tau_n : \dot \tau_i \in \WW_-, \ n=1,2,... \rangle,
$$
%and that any $v \in \BB_-^*$ gives rise to $\ell \in \GG_-\subset \TT_{-}^{* }$.
so writing $\tau_i = \phi^{-1} (\dot \tau_i) \in \BB_-$, we have that associated to $v \in \BB_-^*$ the character $\ell \in \GG_-$ given explicitly by the formula
$$
    \ell ( \dot \tau_1 \cdot .... \cdot \dot \tau_n ) =  \ell ( \dot \tau_1) ...  \ell (\dot \tau_n ) = \langle v, \tau_1 \rangle ... \langle v, \tau_n \rangle.
$$   
Define now $$(\HH_-,\cdot)$$ as the free commutative algebra generated by the subspace $ \BB_- $ of $\tilde \HH$ (remark that the product in $\HH_-$ has nothing to do with the product in $\HH$ itself), so that there is an algebra isomorphism
\[
\HH_- \leftrightarrow \TT_-.
\]
A typical element of $ \HH_- $ looks like:
\begin{equs}
\tikzexternaldisable 
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2,baseline=-0.1cm]
        \node at (0,0)  [dot,label= {[label distance=-0.2em]below: \scriptsize  $ 2 $} ] (root) {};
     \end{tikzpicture} \tikzexternaldisable  \Xi_1 +\Xi_2 + \Xi_2 \cdot

         \node at (1,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ 2 $}] (right) {};
         \node at (-1,2)  [dot,label={[label distance=-0.2em]above: \scriptsize  $ 3 $} ] (left) {};
            \draw[kernel1] (right) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root); \draw[kernel1] (left) to
     node [sloped,below] {\small }     (root);
     \end{tikzpicture} \tikzexternaldisable\Xi_3,
     \end{equs}
  whereas one has $ \tikzexternaldisable 
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2,baseline=-0.1cm]
        \node at (0,0)  [dot,label= {[label distance=-0.2em]below: \scriptsize  $ 2 $} ] (root) {};
     \end{tikzpicture} \tikzexternaldisable  \notin \HH_- $.


Note that we can also make the identification of algebras 
$$\HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT_+.$$ 
For instance, using the bracket notation,
\[    [\bullet_0]_{\bullet_0} \bullet_0 + [\bullet_i]_{\bullet_j} [\bullet_k]_{\bullet_l} \leftrightarrow   \JJ (\II() )  \JJ (1) + \JJ(  \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) \JJ(  \II(\Xi_k) \Xi_l) \quad \in \tilde \TT_+.
\] 
We denote by $\tilde \GG_+ \subset \tilde \TT_+^*$ the characters on $\tilde \TT_+$ and note that there is also a bijection $\GG \leftrightarrow \tilde\GG_+$, where we recall that $\GG\subset\HH^*$ is the Butcher group over $\R^{1+d}$, i.e.,
the set of characters on $\HH$.

To summarise, we have the following identifications in place
\begin{align*}
\tilde \HH &\leftrightarrow \tilde \TT, \\
\HH_- &\leftrightarrow \TT_-, \\
\HH &\leftrightarrow \tilde \TT_+, \\
\BB_-^* &\leftrightarrow \langle \WW_- \rangle \leftrightarrow \GG_- \subset \TT_-^* \\
\GG &\leftrightarrow \tilde \GG_+ \subset \tilde \TT_+^*.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Renormalization as rough path translations} 
It now only remains to identify (a family of) branched rough paths with a class of models on a suitable regularity structure. Define the index set $A := \{0\} \cup \alpha\mathbb{N}\cup(\alpha\mathbb{N}-1)$. Recall that the action of $g \in \tilde \GG_+$ on $\tilde \TT$ is given exactly as before by
\[
\Gamma_g \tau = (\id \otimes g)\Deltap \tau, \; \; \forall \tau \in \tilde \TT.
\]
Note that $\Gamma_g$ indeed maps $\tilde\TT$ to itself due to the definition of $\tilde \GG_+$. Note further that
$\Gamma_g \Gamma_h$ (as a composition of linear maps) is exactly $\Gamma_{g \circ h}$ (with $\circ$ the product in $\tilde \GG_+$ given as the dual of $\Deltap$), and so
$$
     G := \{ \Gamma_g:  g \in (\tilde \GG_+, \circ) \}. 
$$
is indeed a group of endomorphisms of $\tilde\TT$.

Recall now the definition of a regularity structure from~\cite{Hairer14} Definition~2.1.

\begin{lemma} 
The triplet $(A,\tilde \TT, G)$ is a regularity structure.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The only non-trivial property to check is that for all $\tau \in \tilde \TT$ of degree $\alpha \in A$ and $\Gamma \in G$, $\Gamma \tau - \tau$ is a linear combination of terms of degree strictly less than $\alpha$, which in turn is a direct consequence of the definition of $\Deltap : \tilde \TT \rightarrow \tilde \TT \otimes \tilde \TT_+$ from~\eqref{e:recDeltaNew} (see end of Section~\ref{subsubsec:RDEs}).
\end{proof}

Recall also the definition of a model on a regularity structure (see~\cite{Hairer14} Definition~2.17). Let $\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$ denote the set of all models $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ for $(A,\tilde\TT, G)$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
 \item\label{point:M1} $\Pi_t 1$ is the constant function $1$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$,
 \item\label{point:M2} $\Gamma_{st}=\operatorname{id}$ for $s,t\in(-\infty,0]$ and for $s,t\in[T,\infty)$,
 \item\label{point:M3} $(\Pi_t\II y)'=\Pi_t y$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$ and $y\in\tilde \TT$. (Here $(..)'$ denotes the Schwartz derivative.).
\end{enumerate}


\medskip
\medskip

On the other hand, let $\mathscr{R}^\alpha_{[0,T]}$ be the set of all $(1+d)$-dimensional $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder branched rough paths $\mathbf{X}:\,[0,T]^2\rightarrow \GG$ whose zeroth component is time, i.e., $\gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}, \bullet_0} = t-s$ and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zeroTime}
\gen{\Xbf_{s,t}, [\tau]_{\bullet_0}} = \int_{s}^t \gen{\Xbf_{s,u}, \tau} du, \; \; \forall \tau \in \HH, \; s,t \in [0,T].
\end{equation}
Observe that this condition necessarily implies that $\Xbf$ satisfies condition~\eqref{eq:mixedVar} from Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs} (cf. Remark~\ref{remark:colifting}). Note that $\mathbf{X}_{s,t}$ can be identified with an element of $\tilde \GG_+$ due to the identification $\GG \leftrightarrow \tilde \GG_+$,.

Finally, observe that $\phi$ defined in~\eqref{eq:BFIsom} may be extended to an vector space isomorphism
$$ \phi:    \BB \leftrightarrow  \BPrimal \Xi_0  \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_1 \oplus ....  \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_d \cong \HH \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_1 \oplus ....  \oplus \BPrimal \Xi_d \equiv \tilde \HH$$ 
which maps a tree $\tau \in \BB$ into a forest $\phi(\tau) \equiv \dot \tau$, as illustrated in

Conversely, $\phi^{-1}$ adds an extra node (which becomes the root) and should be thought of as taking the integral of a symbol in $\tilde \HH$.  The following result makes this precise by giving a bijection between $\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$ and $\mathscr{R}^\alpha_{[0,T]}$.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:rosa}
There is a bijective map $I:\,\mathscr{R}^\alpha_{[0,T]}\rightarrow\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$ which maps a branched rough path $\mathbf{X}$ to the unique model $(\Pi,\Gamma)\in\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$ with the property that
\begin{align*}
(\Pi_s \II\dot \tau)(t) &= \gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau}\quad \forall\,\tau\in\BB \quad \forall s,t \in [0,T],
\end{align*}
where we have made the identifications $\phi (\tau) \equiv \dot \tau \in \tilde \HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT$. Furthermore, the model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ satisfies $\Gamma_{ts} = \Gamma_{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}}$ (where we have made the identification $\mathbf{X}_{s,t} \in \GG \cong \tilde \GG_+$) and the multiplicativity property
\begin{equation}\label{eq:modelMult}
\Pi_t ((\II y_1) \ldots (\II y_n)) = \Pi_t (\II y_1) \ldots \Pi_t (\II y_n), \quad \forall n \in \N \quad \forall y_i \in \tilde \TT.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

%\begin{remark}
%By definition of a branched rough path, given a forest $\mathfrak{f} = \tau_1 ... \tau_n \in \HH$, it holds that $\langle \mathbf{X}_{s,t}, \mathfrak{f} \rangle  =\langle  \mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau_1 \rangle ... \langle \mathbf{X}_{s,t},\tau_n \rangle$. The corresponding multiplicativity on the left-hand side above is hardwired in property 4 in the definition of 
%$\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$.  
%\end{remark} 

\begin{proof}
Consider $\Xbf \in \mathscr{R}^\alpha_{[0,T]}$. For all $s,t \in [0,T]$ define $\Gamma_{ts} = \Gamma_{\mathbf{X}_{s,t}}$ and $(\Pi_s\II\dot\tau)(t) = \gen{\Xbf_{s,t},\tau}$ for all $\tau \in \BB$. Observe that we may further impose on $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ that properties~\ref{point:M1} and~\ref{point:M2} hold. Furthermore, for every $\tau \notin \II\tilde \TT$, we may define $\Pi_t \tau = (\Pi_t \II\tau)'$, which completely characterises $\Pi$. It remains to verify~\eqref{eq:modelMult}, that property~\ref{point:M3} holds for all $\tau \in \II\tilde \TT$, and that $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ is indeed a model.

For~\eqref{eq:modelMult}, note that from~\eqref{eq:zeroTime}
\begin{align*}
\Pi_t(\II \dot \tau_1\ldots \II \dot \tau_n) &= (\Pi_t \II(\II \dot \tau_1\ldots \II \dot\tau_n))' \\
&= (\gen{\Xbf_{t,\cdot}, \phi^{-1}(\II \dot \tau_1\ldots \II \dot\tau_n)})' \\
&= (\gen{\mathbf{\Xbf}_{t,\cdot},[\tau_1\ldots\tau_n]_{\bullet_0}})' \\
&= \gen{\mathbf{\Xbf}_{t,\cdot}, \tau_1\ldots\tau_n} \\
&= \gen{\mathbf{\Xbf}_{t,\cdot},\tau_1}\ldots\gen{\mathbf{\Xbf}_{t,\cdot},\tau_n} = \Pi_t(\II\dot\tau_1)\ldots \Pi_t(\II\dot\tau_n).
\end{align*}

To show property~\ref{point:M3} for $\dot \tau = \II\dot{\bar\tau} \in \II\tilde \TT$, where $\dot{\bar\tau} \in \tilde \TT$, observe that $\phi([\bar\tau]_{\bullet_0}) = \dot \tau$, so that again by~\eqref{eq:zeroTime}
\begin{align*}
\Pi_t \dot \tau &= \Pi_t \II \dot{\bar\tau} \\
&= \gen{\Xbf_{t,\cdot}, \bar\tau} \\
&= (\gen{\Xbf_{t,\cdot}, [\bar\tau]_{\bullet_0}})' \\
&= (\Pi_t \II\phi([\bar \tau]_{\bullet_0}))' \\
&= (\Pi_t \II\dot \tau)'.
\end{align*}

It remains to show that $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ is a model. 
We first verify that $\Pi_s \Gamma_{s,t} = \Pi_t$. Let $\tau \in \BB$, so that $\II(\dot \tau) \in \tilde \TT$. Recall that the Connes-Kreimer coproduct $\Delta_\star : \HH \mapsto \HH \otimes \HH$ as was introduced in Section~\ref{subsec:PrelimsForest} can be defined recursively by
\[
\Delta_\star [\tau_1\ldots\tau_n]_{\bullet_i} = [\tau_1\ldots\tau_n]_{\bullet_i} \otimes 1 + (\id \otimes [\cdot]_{\bullet_i}) \Delta_\star(\tau_1\ldots \tau_n), \; \; \forall \tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n \in \BB, \; i \in \{0,\ldots, d\}.
\]
With this recursion, one can verify that
\[
\Deltap : \II(\tilde \TT) \mapsto \II(\tilde \TT) \otimes \tilde \TT_+
\]
agrees with the ``reversed'' Connes-Kreimer coproduct 
\[
\sigma_{1,2}\Delta_\star : \BB \mapsto \BB \otimes \HH,
\]
where $\sigma_{1,2} : \HH \otimes \BB \mapsto \BB \otimes \HH$, $\sigma_{1,2} : \tau \otimes \bar \tau \mapsto \bar \tau \otimes \tau$, and where we make the usual identification $\HH\leftrightarrow \tilde \TT_+$ as well as $\phi^{\II} : \BB \mapsto \II(\tilde \TT)$ via $\phi^{\II} : \tau \mapsto \II(\dot\tau)$ (which is of course just $\II\circ \phi$).
Therefore, treating $\Xbf_{s,t}$ as a character on $\HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT_+$, we have for all $\tau \in \BB$
\begin{align}\label{eq:Xtensor}
\begin{split}
(\Pi_t \Gamma_{ts}\II\dot \tau )(u) &= (\Pi_t(\id \otimes \Xbf_{s,t})\Deltap \II\dot\tau)(u) \\
&= \gen{\Xbf_{t,u}, (\phi^{\II})^{-1} (\id \otimes \Xbf_{s,t})\Deltap \II\dot\tau)} \\
&= \gen{\Xbf_{t,u}, (\Xbf_{s,t} \otimes \id)\Delta_\star \tau)} \\
&= \gen{\Xbf_{s,t} \otimes \Xbf_{t,u}, \Delta_\star \tau} \\
&= \gen{\Xbf_{s,t} \tensor \Xbf_{t,u}, \tau} \\
&= \gen{\Xbf_{s,u}, \tau} \\
&= \Pi_s(\II\dot \tau)(u).
\end{split}
\end{align}
Observe now that for $\tau \in \tilde \TT$, we have
\[
\Gamma_{ts}\II\tau = \II\Gamma_{ts}\tau + \gen{\Xbf_{s,t},\II\tau} 1,
\]
where we emphasize the symbol $1 \in \tilde \TT$. Therefore, by the (already established) properties~\ref{point:M1} and~\ref{point:M3}, it follows that for any $\tau \in \tilde \TT$
\[
\Pi_t \Gamma_{ts}\tau = (\Pi_t \II \Gamma_{ts} \tau )' = (\Pi_t(\Gamma_{ts} \II\tau - \gen{\Xbf_{s,t},\II\tau} 1))' = (\Pi_t\Gamma_{ts} \II\tau)' = (\Pi_s \II\tau)' = \Pi_s \tau,
\]
which shows that $\Pi_t\Gamma_{ts} = \Pi_s$.

It remains to verify the analytic bounds on $(\Pi,\Gamma)$. As in Theorem~\ref{thm:transRPs}, denote by $|\tau|$ the number of nodes in $\tau$ and by $|\tau|_0$ the number of nodes with the label $0$. It follows that the degree of $\II\dot\tau$ is given by $|\II\dot\tau| = |\tau|_0(1-\alpha) + |\tau|\alpha$. Since $\Xbf$ satisfies~\eqref{eq:mixedVar}, we have the analytic bound
\[
|(\Pi_s\II\dot\tau)(t)| = |\gen{\Xbf_{s,t}, \tau}| \lesssim |t-s|^{|\II\dot\tau|}.
\]
Since $\Pi_s\tau = (\Pi_s\II\tau)'$ by property~\ref{point:M3}, we see that $\Pi$ satisfies the correct analytic bounds. The exact same argument applies to $\Gamma$ upon using the identification of $\Deltap$ with $\sigma_{1,2}\Delta_\star$ above. Therefore $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ is a model in $\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$ as claimed.

Finally, it remains to observe that we may reverse the construction. Indeed, starting with a model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ in $\mathscr{M}_{[0,T]}$, we may define $\Xbf$ by $\gen{\Xbf_{s,t},\tau} = (\Pi_s\II\dot\tau)(t)$. The facts that $\Xbf$ satisfies~\eqref{eq:zeroTime} follows from property~\ref{point:M3}, while the required analytic bounds for $\Xbf$ to be an $\alpha$-H{\"o}lder branched rough path follow from the analytic bounds associated to $\Pi$. To conclude, it suffices to verify that $\Xbf$ thus defined satisfies $\Gamma_{ts} = \Gamma_{\Xbf_{s,t}}$ and $\Xbf_{s,t}\tensor \Xbf_{t,u} = \Xbf_{s,u}$. To this end, note that by definition of the structure group $G$, there exists $\gamma_{ts} \in \tilde \GG_+ \cong \GG$ such that $\Gamma_{ts} = (\id \otimes \gamma_{ts})\Deltap$. Let $\tilde \Xbf_{s,t} \in \GG$ be the element associated to $\gamma_{ts}$ in the identification $\tilde \GG_+ \cong \GG$, and we aim to show $\tilde \Xbf_{s,t} = \Xbf_{s,t}$. Indeed, from our identification $\HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT_+$, it follows that for all $\tau \in \BB$
\[
\gen{\gamma_{ts}, \JJ\dot\tau} = \gen{\tilde \Xbf_{s,t}, \tau}.
\]
On the other hand, we know that for all $\tau \in \BB$
\[
\gen{\Xbf_{s,t},\tau} = (\Pi_s\II\dot\tau)(t) = (\Pi_t \Gamma_{ts}\II\dot \tau) (t) = (\Pi_t (\id\otimes \gamma_{ts})\Deltap\II\dot\tau)(t) = \gen{\gamma_{ts},\JJ\dot\tau},
\]
where for the last equality we have used property~\ref{point:M1} and the fact that
\[
\Deltap \II\dot\tau = 1\otimes \JJ\dot\tau + \sum \II(\dot\tau^{(1)})\otimes \dot\tau^{(2)},
\]
where every term $\II(\dot\tau^{(1)})$ is of positive degree, and so $(\Pi_t\II(\dot\tau^{(1)}))(t) = 0$. This concludes the proof that $\Gamma_{ts} = \Gamma_{\Xbf_{s,t}}$. To verify that $\Xbf_{s,t}\tensor \Xbf_{t,u} = \Xbf_{s,u}$, we can now simply reorder the sequence of equalities~\eqref{eq:Xtensor}.
\end{proof}

Following \cite{BHZ16} we introduce the {\it renormalization map} $\mathrm{M}_{\ell}$ given by\footnote{While we deliberately used the same letter, do not confuse $\mathrm{M}_{\ell}: \tilde \TT \to \tilde \TT$ with $M_v : \HH^* \to \HH^*$.} 
\[
\mathrm{M}_{\ell}:\tilde \TT \to \tilde \TT,\,\,\,\tau \mapsto \left( \ell\otimes \id\right) \Deltam \tau,
\]
for a given character $\ell \in \mathcal{G}_{-} \subset \TT_{-}^{* }$. In our case, we have the fact that $\mathrm{M}_{\ell}$ commutes with $\II$ (cf. end of Remark~\ref{cointeraction})
\begin{equ}
        \mathrm{M}_{\ell} \II = \II \mathrm{M}_{\ell},    \label{equ:MIeIM}
\end{equ}
which is readily verified by hand: $\II$ amounts to adding another edge to the root (thereby creating a new root), whereas $\mathrm{M}_{\ell}$ amounts to extracting (negative) subtrees and maps them to $\R$ (via $\ell$). Clearly, the afore-mentioned edge (of degree $1$) can not possibly be part of any singular subtree, hence the desired commutation.

 This map acts on a model $\mathbf{\Pi}  = ( \Pi, \Gamma )$ and yields the {\it renormalised model} (see~\cite{BHZ16} Theorem~6.15) given by
\[
\Pi_s^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell }} := {\Pi_s } \mathrm{M}_{\ell }, \quad \Gamma_{t,s}^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell }} = \left( \id \otimes \gamma_{t,s}^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell }} \right) \Deltap, \quad 
\gamma_{t,s}^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell }} = \gamma_{t,s} \mathrm{M}_{\ell }.
\] 

Recall from Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapBranched} the map $\delta : \BB \mapsto \A \otimes \BB$, where $\A$ is the free commutative algebra generated by $\BB$ (thought of as an isomorphic but different space to $\HH$).
Let $\pi_- : \tilde \HH \cong \BB \mapsto \BB_- \cong \gen{\WW_-}$ denote the projection onto terms of negative degree, which we extend multiplicatively to an algebra morphism $\pi_- : \A \mapsto \HH_-$. We now define the map
\[
\extract^- = (\pi_- \otimes \id) \extract : \tilde\HH \mapsto \HH_-\otimes \tilde\HH.
\]
For instance
\[
\extract^- \bullet_0 = 1 \otimes \bullet_0,
\]
whereas
\[
\extract \bullet_0 = \bullet_0 \otimes \bullet_0 + 1\otimes\bullet_0.
\]

We are now ready to state the link between translation of branched rough paths and negative renormalization in the following two results.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:MvsM}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape(\roman*\upshape)]
\item \label{point:MvsM1} We have
\[
\Delta ^{-}\dot{\tau}=\Delta ^{-}\phi \left( \tau \right) =\left( \phi
\otimes \phi \right) \delta ^{-}\left( \tau \right).
\]
\item \label{point:MvsM2} For all $v \in \BB_-^*$ it holds that
$$
\mathrm{M}_{\ell}\dot{\tau} = \mathrm{M}_{\ell} \phi \left( \tau \right) = \phi \left( M^*_{v}\tau \right) 
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\ref{point:MvsM1} Let us consider $[\tau]_{\bullet_i} \in \mathcal{B}$. We then have the following identities:
\begin{equs}\label{rec_identity}
\Deltam \phi([\tau]_{\bullet_i}) & = \Deltam \tau\Xi_i =
\sum_{C=A \cdot B \subset \tau  } \left( C \otimes (\mathcal{R}_{C} \tau) \Xi_i + A \cdot B \Xi_i \otimes \mathcal{R}_{C} \tau \right). 
\end{equs}
The sum is taken over all the couples $(A,B)$ where $ A $ is a negative subforest of $ \tau $ which does not include the root of $ \tau $ and $ B $ is a subtree of $\tau $ at the root disjoint from $ A $. In the sum in~\eqref{rec_identity}, the first term means that $ \Xi_i $ does not belong to the tree extracted at the root, while for the second term, $ \Xi_i $ belongs to the tree which comes from the product between $ \Xi_i $  and $ B $ giving a subtree of negative degree.
 One can derive the same identity for $ \delta^- $. We first rewrite $ \delta^- $:
 \begin{equs}
 \delta^- \tau = \sum_{A \subset \tau} A \otimes \tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{A} \tau,
 \end{equs}
 where $ A $ is a subforest of $ \tau $ and  $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{A} \tau$  means that we contract the trees of $ A $ in $ \tau $ and we leave a $ 0 $ decoration on their roots. Then the equivalent of~\eqref{rec_identity} in that context is given by:
\begin{equs}
\delta^{-} [\tau]_{\bullet_i} & = \sum_{\tilde C = \tilde A \cdot \tilde{B} \subset \tau } \left( \tilde C \otimes [\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde{C}} \tau]_{\bullet_i} + \tilde A \cdot [\tilde{B}]_{\bullet_i} \otimes \tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde A \cdot [\tilde B]_{\bullet_i}} [\tau]_{\bullet_i} \right) \\
\left( \phi \otimes \phi \right) \delta^-  [\tau]_{\bullet_i} & = \sum_{\tilde C = \tilde A \cdot \tilde{B} \subset \tau  } \left( \phi(\tilde{C}) \otimes (\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde{C}} \tau) \Xi_i + \phi(\tilde A) \cdot \tilde{B} \Xi_i \otimes \phi\left( \tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde A \cdot [\tilde B]_{\bullet_i}} [\tau]_{\bullet_i}  \right) \right).
\end{equs} 
Now we have the following identifications:
\begin{equs}
\phi(\tilde C)   \leftrightarrow C, \quad \tilde{B} \Xi_i \leftrightarrow B \Xi_i, \quad   \phi\left( \tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde A \cdot [\tilde B]_{\bullet_i}} [\tau]_{\bullet_i}  \right) = \tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde{C}} \tau \leftrightarrow  \mathcal{R}_{C} \tau, \quad (\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\tilde{C}} \tau) \Xi_i \leftrightarrow (\mathcal{R}_{C} \tau) \Xi_i,
\end{equs}
which gives the result.

\ref{point:MvsM2}  Recall that $\delta ^{-}\left( \tau \right) $ has an image of the form
``forest $\otimes $ tree'', and that $\ell \circ \phi = v$ (which is a ``dual'' tree and multiplicative over forests). Also note that $M^*_{v}\tau
=\left( v\otimes \id\right) \delta =\left( v\otimes \id\right) \delta ^{-}$
whenever $\ v\in \mathcal{B}_{-}^{\ast }$ (which not true for general $v\in 
\mathcal{B}^{\ast }$), so that  
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{M}_{\ell}\dot{\tau} &=&\left( \ell \otimes \id\right) \Delta ^{-}\dot{\tau}
\\
&=&\left( \ell \otimes \id\right) \Delta ^{-}\phi \left( \tau \right)  \\
&=&\left( v\otimes \phi \right) \delta ^{-}\left( \tau \right)  \\
&=&\phi \left( \left( v\otimes \id\right) \delta ^{-}\right)  \\
&=&\phi \left( M^*_{v}\tau \right).
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{proof} 


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:NegRenorm}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape(\roman*\upshape)]
\item \label{point:Neg1} It holds that the restriction $\Deltam : \tilde \TT \mapsto \TT_-\otimes \tilde \TT$ coincides with $\extract^- : \tilde\HH \mapsto \HH_- \otimes \tilde\HH$, where we have made the identifications $\tilde\HH \leftrightarrow \tilde \TT$ and $\HH_- \leftrightarrow \TT_-$ as above.

\item \label{point:Neg2} Let $v$ be an element of $\BB_-^*$ and let $\ell \in \GG_-$  by the associated element in $\GG_- \subset \TT_-^*$, as was detailed in~\eqref{id:BBmGm}.
Then the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
\mathbf{X} & \longleftrightarrow  & \mathbf{\Pi } \\ 
\downarrow  &  & \downarrow  \\ 
M_{v}\mathbf{X} & \longleftrightarrow  & \mathbf{\Pi }^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell}}
\end{array}
\]

\item \label{point:Neg3} For $v,v' \in \BB_-$ with associated characters $\ell, \ell' \in \GG_-$, it holds that the character associated to $v+ v'$ is $\ell \circ \ell'$, so that $\left( \mathcal{B}_{-},+\right) \cong \left( \mathcal{G}_{-},\circ \right) $.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
The final statement~\ref{point:Neg3} effectively says that the renormalization group associated to branched rough path is always abelian, despite the highly non-commutative nature of $\HH^*$, the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The above theorem along with the discussion in Section~\ref{subsec:effectsRDEs} (see in particular Remark~\ref{remark:BCF} and Theorem~\ref{thm:transRDEs}) provides a straightforward example of how S(P)DEs change under the negative renormalization maps in the sense of~\cite{BHZ16}.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:NegRenorm}]
Part~\ref{point:Neg1} is a straightforward consequence of Lemma~\ref{lem:MvsM}~\ref{point:MvsM1}.

To verify~\ref{point:Neg2}, in view of Proposition \ref{prop:rosa}, we only need to check
\[
\Pi _{s}^{\mathrm{M}_{l}}\II\dot{\tau}=\left\langle M_{v}\mathbf{X}_{s,\cdot
},\tau \right\rangle =\left\langle \mathbf{X}_{s,\cdot },M_{v}^{\ast }\tau
\right\rangle  \; \; \forall \tau \in \BB.
\]%
The LHS can be rewritten as, thanks to~\eqref{equ:MIeIM} and Lemma \ref{lem:MvsM}~\ref{point:MvsM2}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pi _{s}^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell}}\II\dot{\tau} &=&\Pi _{s}\mathrm{M}_{\ell}\II\dot{\tau} \\
&=&\Pi _{s}\II \mathrm{M}_{\ell}\dot{\tau} \\
&=&\Pi _{s}\II \phi \left( M^*_{v}\tau \right).
\end{eqnarray*}%
Applying Proposition \ref{prop:rosa} with $\dot\tau = \phi \left( M_{v}\tau \right) $ then shows
that 
\[
\Pi _{s}\II \phi \left( M_{v}\tau \right) =\left\langle \mathbf{X}_{s,\cdot
},M_{v}^{\ast }\tau \right\rangle 
\]%
which is what we wanted to show.


%\[
%\gen{(M_v\mathbf{X})_{s,t},\tau} = (\Pi^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell}}_s \II \tau)(t), \; \; \forall \tau \in \BB.
%\]
%Since $\gen{(M_v\mathbf{X})_{s,t},\tau} = \gen{\mathbf{X}_{s,t},M_v^*\tau}$, this in turn follows from the expression for $M_v^*$ (Section~\ref{subsec:DualMapBranched}), the relation between $v$ and $\ell$, and the fact that in our case
%\[
%\Pi_s^{\mathrm{M}_{\ell}}(\II\tau) = \Pi_s(\mathrm{M}_{\ell} \II\tau).
%\]
%
%
%Thanks to (\ref{equ:MIeIM}) ....
%

Finally, to show~\ref{point:Neg3}, we note that
\[
\gen{\ell \circ \ell', \tau} = \gen{\ell \otimes \ell', \Deltam \tau} = \gen{\ell,\tau} + \gen{\ell',\tau}, \; \; \forall \tau \in \WW_-,
\]
where the first equality follows by definition and the second from the fact that every element of $\WW_-$ is primitive with respect to the coproduct $\Deltam$. Indeed from the Remark \ref{cured_trees}, we deduce that the coaction $\Deltam$ maps every  $ \tau \in  \WW_- $ into $ \tau \otimes \one + \sum_{(\tau)} \tau' \otimes \tau'' $ such that $ \tau'' $ is a tree of positive degree. However, $\Deltam$ as coproduct on $\TT_-$ (see~\eqref{Dmcp}), will annihilate any term with $\tau''$ of (strictly) positive degree. In particular then, $\Deltam \tau = 1 \otimes \tau + \tau \otimes 1$ for all $\tau \in \WW_-$, that is, any such $\tau$ is primitive.
\end{proof}

\section{ Branched rough path versus general regularity structure notation (needs cleanup, PKF} 

\subsection{Positive renormalization}

Recall the action of $\Deltap : \TT \mapsto \TT \otimes \TT_+$ with the appropriate spaces, in the case of bRP, given by 
$$
    \TT  = \langle  \Xi_i, ... , \II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)\Xi_k,  .... , 1, \II(\Xi_i), \II(\Xi_i) \II(\Xi_j), ..... , \II ( \Xi_k\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)), \II (  \II(\Xi_i) \II(\Xi_j)),  ... \rangle
$$
and, with all indices allowed to range in $\{1, ..., d\}$, the unital commutative algebra generated $\TT_+$ generated by, cf. Section \ref{sec:51},
$$\{  1, \II(\Xi_i),  \II( \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) , \II (  \II(  \II(\Xi_i) \Xi_j ) \Xi_k ),  \II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j) \Xi_k), ... ,\II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)), ... \}.
$$
Writing $\bullet$ for the (commutative) product in  $\TT_+$, we then have terms such as $ \II(\Xi_i) \bullet  \II(\Xi_hj)$ in  $\TT_+$, next to many other products and their linear combinations.  (In previous articles, $\TT_+$ was given in terms of $\mathcal{J}$ rather than $\II$ to emphasize that its elements are from a different space.)

We want to compare this with the Connes--Kreimer coproduct 
$\Delta_\star: \BPrimal \to \BPrimal \otimes \BPrimal$ where we recall that $\BPrimal$  can be introduced as unital commutative algebra generated by the ``trees'' 
$$\{  1, \bullet_i, [ \bullet_i  ]_j,   [ [ \bullet_i  ]_j ]_k,  [ \bullet_i  \bullet_j ]_k , ... \};
$$
elements of $\BPrimal$ are then naturally interpreted as forests (cf. Section \ref{sec:4}). For instance, we have the forest $ \bullet_i  \bullet_j \in \BPrimal$, in obvious correspondence with
$ \II(\Xi_i) \blacksquare  \II(\Xi_hj) \in \TT_+$. However, not every element in $\TT_+$ has a correspondence in $\BPrimal$, as already seen in the ``generating'' element $\II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j))$). That is, unless one introduces a $0$-noise symbols $\Xi_0$ (think: abstract symbols for the constant $1$ function)
which allows to identify
$$
\II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j)) = \II (\II(\Xi_i)\II(\Xi_j) \Xi_0 )\leftrightarrow  [ \bullet_i  \bullet_j ]_0.
$$
{\color{red} PKF: Should we view $\BPrimal  (\R^d)$ is a sub Hopf algebra of $T_+$? Or $T_+$ sub Hopf algebra of $\BPrimal  (\R^{1+d}) $?
Reconcile with identification made in Section 5.2!}


It is instructive, for explicit inspection, to compute the first few terms of $\Deltap, \ \Delta _{\star} $.
\begin{eqnarray*}
%&& \\ \hline
\Delta ^{+}\Xi ^{j} &=&\Xi ^{j}\otimes 1 \\
\Delta ^{+}\II\Xi ^{i} &=&\II\Xi ^{i}\otimes 1+1\otimes \II\Xi ^{i} \\

\\

\II\left( \II\left( \Xi ^{h}\right) \II\left( \Xi ^{i}\right) \Xi ^{j}\right)  \\
\Delta _{\star }\left[ \bullet _{h}\bullet _{i}\right] _{j} &=&\left[

&&+\bullet _{i}\otimes \left[ \bullet _{h}\right] _{j}+\left( \bullet
_{i} \bullet _{h}\right) \otimes \bullet _{j}+1\otimes \left[ \bullet
_{h}\bullet _{i}\right] _{j}  \\ \hline
&& 
\end{eqnarray*}%

Note that $\tau''$ in the Sweedler decomposition $\Delta^{+} \tau = \sum \tau' \otimes \tau ''$ indeed always consists of terms of positive degree (i.e. $\II(...)$ in the 
present context) and free commutative products (denoted by $\bullet$) thereof, such as $\II\Xi^i \bullet \II\Xi^h$, not to be confused with the term $I\Xi^i I\Xi^h$ which also figures in the list of symbols created by the algorithm in BHZ but not in H14, since it does not appear in the branched rough path expansions. That said, $I\Xi^i \bullet I\Xi^h$ clearly corresponds to the forest (product) $\bullet_{i} \bullet _{h}$ in the branched rough path setting. 

Subject to a flip ($\tau' \leftrightarrow \tau''$) we can then see that $\Delta_\star$ 
is effectively $\Delta^{+}$ when restricted to [....]
