This paper presents the first MD simulations of a model, which we have designed for understanding the development of electro-induced instability of a thin toluene emulsion film in contact with saline aqueous phase. This study demonstrates the charge accumulation role in toluene film rupture when a DC electric field is applied. The critical value of the external field at which film ruptures, thin film charge distribution, capacitance, number densities and film structure have been obtained in simulating the system within $NVT$ and $NPT$ ensembles.  A mechanism of thin film rupture driven by the electric discharge is suggested.We show that $NPT$ ensemble with a constant surface tension is a better choice for further modeling of the systems that resemble more close the real films.
