\section{The model and simulation procedure}

To accurately simulate the interfacial phenomena, we have applied the classical MD method for the case of two canonical ensembles - $NVT$  and  $NPT$. The choice of ensembles in MD simulations of finite-size systems has already been shown to play an important role in coexisting phases \cite{Pisov_2001}. MD Simulations provide detailed information on the molecular structure of the interface when the intermolecular potential is available \cite{Koplik,Koplik2014,Pisov_2012}.\\

The model system is a $5\, nm$ thick toluene film located perpendicularly to the $z$-axis  of the simulation box. The size of the box  $24.8 \times 24.8 \times 24.8\, nm$ ensures that no artifacts will appear when $3D$ periodic boundary conditions are implemented to diminish finite-size effects. The box contains also  water molecules and $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ ions at a concentration of $1M$.  The force field parameters of the  ions $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ included in the model are  taken from {\it Gromos96}  \cite{doi:10.1021/jp984217f}. Parameters for toluene molecules are derived from  benzyl side chain of phenylalanine molecule. Three-site $SPC$ (simple point charge) water model is used \cite{doi:10.1021/j100308a038}.

Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the model system are performed with the help of the  {\it GROMACS} package, designed to simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles \cite{Berendsen199543}. The simulations are performed in  canonical $NVT$  and  $NPT$ ensembles which keep the total number of atoms constant; the temperature is $T = 298 K$.  In the $NVT$ ensemble the constant volume equals to the size of the simulation box, $24.8 \times 24.8 \times 24.8\, nm$. In the case of the $NPT$ ensemble the system is equilibrated at the constant pressure of $1\, bar$. After the equilibration, the simulation is performed at a constant surface tension $\gamma = 36.4\, mN/m$ between toluene and water \cite{Drelich_2002}. 
 In preliminary MD runs the  simulation time of  $5\, ns$ was determined to be sufficient for  thermodynamic equilibration of the total energy,  pressure, and temperature of the model system.\\
 An external electric field is applied  in the $z$ direction of the simulation box. In the $NVT$ ensemble the electric field strength is changed from $0$ to $120\, mV/nm$ in steps of $20\, mV/nm$,  while in the $NPT$ ensemble the strength is changed   from $0$ to $75\, mV/nm$ in steps of $25\, mV/nm$ .
