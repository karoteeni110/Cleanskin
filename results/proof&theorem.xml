  <title>Tube algebra of group-type subfactors 
  </title><abstract>
     We describe the tube algebra and its representations in the cases of diagonal and Bisch-Haagerup subfactors possibly with a scalar  -cocycle obstruction. We show that these categories are additively equivalent to the direct product over conjugacy classes of representation category of a centralizer subgroup (corresponding to the conjugacy class) twisted by a scalar  -cocycle obtained from the  -cocycle obstruction.

      Annular representations of planar algebras were introduced by Vaughan Jones in   to construct subfactors with principal graphs   and  . In the same paper,
he explicitly worked out the Temperley-Lieb example.
These calculations helped in construction of new examples such as  .
Recently, annular representations of subfactors and semisimple rigid  -tensor categories have become a very interesting area of research.
The annular representation category turns out to be a nice braided tensor category - not necessarily semisimple - which is equivalent to the center of the original bimodule /  -tensor category in the case of finite depth / fusion categories (see  ,  ,  ).
For general depth, this category becomes equivalent to the center of a certain induced category (which is basically an extension where infinite direct sums are allowed) - see  ,  .
There is also an analytic aspect of the annular representation category.
Analytic properties, such as, amenabilty, Haagerup property, property (T) of the subfactor /  -tensor category can be reinterpreted in terms of annular representations. 
     
      In this paper, we deal with two group-type subfactors - the so-called diagonal and the Bisch-Haagerup ones - possibly with  -cocyle obstruction.
The approximation properties of these two examples are well-known and depend on the associated group (see  ,   for diagonal and   for Bisch-Haagerup).
We determine the annular representation category.
For this, we borrow techniques from  , namely, we fix a &#8216;full&#8217; weight set in the object space and find the annular category over the weight set.
It was shown in   that the annular representation categories over any two full weight sets are equivalent.
Moreover, annular representations (in the sense of Vaughan Jones) of a subfactor   are the same as the annular representations of the  - -bimodule category   generated by  . 
     
      For the diagonal subfactor,   is a pointed category, that is, the category of group graded vector spaces with a possibly nontrivial associator; the group is the one generated by the automorphisms used to build the diagonal subfactor and the associator is given by the  -cocycle obstruction.
When the cocycle is trivial, the annular representations were discussed in  .
We consider the annular algebra over the irreducible bimodules, that is, Ocneanu&#8217;s tube algebra.
We show that the tube algebra is a direct sum over conjugacy classes of  -algebras consisting of a matrix algebra tensored with the group algebra of the centralizer subgroup twisted by a  -cocycle.
We give the explicit dependence of the  -cocycle on the  -cocycle obstruction. As a result, the annular representation decomposes as (possibly infinite) direct sum of projective representations of the centralizer subgroups corresponding to the conjugacy classes. 
     
      In the Bisch-Haagerup case, we consider the intermediate subfactor   where   and   with  ,   being finite groups acting outerly on the   factor  .
The category of  - -bimodules   generated by   and  , is again a pointed category equivalent to the category of  -graded vector spaces where   is the group generated by   and   in   with the associator given by the  -cocycle obstruction.
This category has special algebra objects, namely,   and  .
Now, the  -category of bimodules over   and   can be made equivalent to the  -category of bimodules in   over   and  .
This was a method suggested to us by Scott Morrison.
However, we obtain the annular representations straight from the actual bifinite  - -bimodules using techniques in  .
  unfortunately is not pointed anymore.
The set of isomorphism classes of irreducibles turns out to be complicated.
So, we consider a different weight set, namely   for   and obtain the annular algebra over it.
As a  -algebra, it turns out to be same as before, namely direct sum over conjugacy classes of matrix algebras tensored with the group algebra of the centralizer subgroup twisted by a  -cocycle. Thereby, the representations are also graded by the conjugacy classes and in each grade the representations are the same as that of the corresponding centralizer subgroup twisted by the  -cocyle.

      Let   be a group with identity element   and   be a 3-cocycle of  , that is,   satisfies the following: 
      We will use Equation   at various instances in the article by denoting the particular elements of   which will correspond to   simply by   respectively.
Up to  -coboundary equivalence, we may consider   to be a normalized cocycle, i.e.,   whenever either   or   is  ; namely, if   for all  , then   is normalized. 
     
      For  , let   denote the centralizer subgroup of  .
The following result may be well-known to specialists but we include the statement for the sake of completeness. 
     
      Instead of  , if we take   for any  , then it is natural to ask whether   is coboundarily equivalent to  . The
answer is yes; however, we will prove not just this, but a slightly general formula which will be useful later.

        We write out the three terms in the L.H.S. of the equation in the statement one by one and expand them using Equation  .
In the successive steps, we just repeat the process, each time expanding the last term coming from the previous step. In the final step, some of the terms are decorated with numbers and strike-throughs, or underlines and alphabets, the explanation for which is given below. These are just elementary cocycle calculations which has been exhibited, down to the last detail.
The first term is: The second term is:  The third term is:  Thus each  -term has been expressed as a product of

After combining these   terms and noting that  (i)   pairs of terms cancel since   (the cancellations have been marked with numbers for the reader&#8217;s convenience), (ii) the last (boxed) terms on the R.H.S of the three expressions above can be combined to yield  , we are left with the following    -terms which have been grouped under A,B, C,D, E, F for reasons that will become apparent as we go along (namely, contribution towards defining the function   in the statement of the Proposition.): A terms:  B terms:  C terms:  D terms:  E terms:  F terms:

      </subsection></section><section title=" Diagonal Subfactors &#10;    ">
      In this section, we will describe the affine module category of the planar algebra of a diagonal subfactor associated associated to a &#8216; -kernel&#8217; where   is a finitely generated discrete group.
Recall that  -kernel  is simply an injective homomorphism   is simply an injective homomorphism   where   is a   factor.
If   is a lift of   (that is,   for all  ) and   is a set of generators of  , then the associated diagonal subfactor is given by 
      Further for  , we may choose   such that   for all  .
Associativity of multiplication in   gives us a  -cocycle   such that 
      for  .
One may easily check that the coboundary class of the  -cocyle   in   does not depend on the choice of the lift   and the unitaries  ; this class is referred as the obstruction of the  -kernel  .
It is well-known (see  ) that the standard invariant of the above subfactor   depends only on the group  , its generators and the  -cocycle obstruction. 
     
      We will find the tube algebra of the category   of  -  bifinite bimodules coming from this subfactor and then find the tube representations.
Note that this will suffice since, by  , the representation category of the tube algebra of   is (tensor) equivalent to the category of annular representations with respect to any full weight set in ob  (in particular,   which gives the affine modules of Jones).
In fact, if  , the affine modules were obtained in  . 
     
      All simple objects in   are invertible.
This is clear because  . Here the notation   (for  ) denotes the bimodule obtained from the Hilbert space   with left  -action being the usual left multiplication whereas the right one is twisted by  . This bimodule depends only on the class defined by   in   up to isomorphism, and the tensor   and the contragradient of such bimodules correspond to multiplication and inverse in  .
Since   is in the set  , we get all such index one bimodules corresponding to any  , appearing as sub-bimodules of   as we vary  .
Moreover, up to isomorphism these are the only irreducible bimodules of  .
Thus, the fusion algebra of   is just given by  .
It is then easy to verify that   is tensor equivalent to the category   of  -graded vector spaces with associativity constraint given by the  -cocycle obstruction  .
So, our job boils down to finding out the tube representations of  .
However, we will work with bimodules in   instead, as the framework will be useful in the next section. 
     
      Since the standard invariant (and thereby the category  ) is independent of the lift  , without loss of generality we assume
 .
Further, we may set   for all  .
These assumptions make the  -cocycle   normalized. 
     
      For  , let  .
The morphism space in   from object   to object  , will be denoted by  .
The tube morphism from   to   is then given by   where  .
Clearly,   if and only if   and   are conjugates of each other.
Further, if  , then   is one-dimensional; we will fix a distinguished element in this space, namely,   defined by 
      It is an easy exercise to check that the above map is indeed an  - -linear unitary. 
     
      Before we multiply two nonzero tube morphisms   and  , we need to know the one dimensional spaces   and  .
Following the multiplication defined in  , we have 
      Right from the definitions, one can easily see that   sends   to 
      Now, 
      Thus, multiplication is given by 
       
      Next we will obtain the  -structure on the tube algebra which we denote by   following the notation in  .
For this, we need a standard solution to the conjugate equations for the pair  .
We set   and  .
It is completely routine to check that   satisfies the conjugate equation and is standard.
Now by  , 
      The map   sends   to  .
Using all the three maps  ,   and  , we can express the image of   under   as 
      We will simplify the first tensor component in the following way: 
      Hence,   is given by the formula: 
       
      The canonical (faithful) trace   on the tube algebra (as defined in  ) is given by  .
Thus, the set   becomes an orthonormal basis with respect to the inner product arising from   and  . 
     
      To have a better understanding of the  -algebra structure of the tube algebra, we will now set up some notations.
Let   denote the set of conjugacy classes of  .
For each  , we pick a representative   and for each  , we fix   such that   and  .
Also for  , we will denote the centralizer subgroup of   by  , and   will denote the  -cocycle on   given by   (recall the definition of   in Lemma  ). 
     
      With the above notation, we give an alternate description of  -algebra structure of the tube algebra in the following proposition which will be handy in classifying the representations. 
    <subsection title="theorem">
         (i) The tube algebra   is isomorphic to   as a  -algebra where   is the  -cocycle twisted group algebra and   denotes the  -algebra of finitely supported matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by elements of  . (ii) Every Hilbert space representation   decomposes over   uniquely (up to isomorphism) as an orthogonal direct sum of submodules generated by the range of the projection   (which is the  -space of  ).
(We will call a representation of   &#8216;supported on  &#8217; if it is generated by its vectors in the  -space.)
The category of  -supported representations of   is additively equivalent to representation category of  . 
      </subsection><subsection title="proof">
        (i) We will send the orthonormal basis of   (discussed above) via a map   to a canonical basis of   in the follwoing way: for   and   such that   (implying  ) 
        where we use the family of functions   appearing in Proposition  . 
       
        To show   preserves multiplication, consider 
        The map   is   preserving because  
        where we use   at the very last step which follows directly from the definition of   in the proof of Proposition  . 
       
        (ii) The decomposition follows easily from the  -algebra structure described in part (i). 
       
        Fix  . If   is  -supported, then we can define the representation   defined by  .
Conversely, if   is a representation, then one can consider the unique extension 
        &#8718; 
      </subsection><subsection title="theorem">
        Note that the canonical trace   on   corresponds to the direct sum of the canonical traces on  .
Also, the  -algebra   (by definition) is isomorphic to the fusion algebra which is basically the group algebra   without any nontrivial  -cocycle twist (since   is the constant function   which follows from its definition in Lemma  ).
Thus, the analytic properties (such as, amenability, Haagerup, property (T)) of the bimodule category corresponding to the subfactor   corresponds exactly to that of the group  ; this fact was obtained by Sorin Popa long time back in   and  .
However, the analytic properties in the higher weight spaces (as defined in  ) depend on the corresponding centralizer subgroup. 
      </subsection></section><section title=" Bisch-Haagerup Subfactors &#10;    ">
      In this section, we intend to find the tube algebra of the Bisch-Haagerup subfactor   where   and   act outerly on the  -factor  .
It is well known that the planar algebra of   depends on the group   generated by   and   in   and the scalar  -cocycle obstruction (up to  -coboundary) (see  ). 
     
      We first lay down the strategy to achieve our goal.
Instead of computing the tube algebra of   directly (unlike the case of diagonal subfactors because the irreducible bimodules of   for Bisch-Haagerup subfactors, are not so easy to work with), we will consider the affine annular algebra with respect to a particular full weight set (in the sense of  ) in  , and then cut it down by the  . 
     
      We need to set up some notations for this.
Pick a representative map   such that  , and  ,   are homomorphisms.
Now, if  ,   and  , then 
      We know that   and  .
So, 
      Since the subgroups   and   generate  , therefore the set   forms a full weight set in  .
It is possible to reduce the indexing set   of the weight set   further, since   for all  .
However, we will not do that since by reducing the weight set, one needs to work with coset representative which makes the calculations more cumbersome. 
    <subsection title=" Morphism spaces in  &#10;      ">
         
       
        For the affine annular algebra over   (indexing the above set), we do not need all morphism spaces of  .
We will instead concentrate on morphisms between elements of   and their tensor products.
Before that, we need more notations.
Choose a map   such that   and 
        Again, associativity of multiplication in   and condition   will give us a  -cocycle   satisfying Equation   and 
        This along with Equation  , implies   and   for all  ,  .
We will now prove a lemma on scalar cocycles which lets us choose the map   in such a way that the  -cocycle   gets simplified making our calculations easy. 
       
        By the above lemma, without loss of generality, we may assume   satisfies: 
        for all  ,   (where (ii), (iii) and (iv) are immediate implication of (i) and  ).
We will need the relation   only when  ; however, we gave the general version, in case any reader is interested to see the actual  -category of   instead of just  . 
       
        Next, we will prove some facts about tensor product of two elements from  .
For   and  , we define  &#8196;&#8196;

        Let   denote the affine annular algebra of   with respect to   which indexes the weight set  .
In our set up, the indexing set   is more important rather than the set  ; for instance,   and   are identical in   when  . 
       
        We will recall the definition of   here.
For  , we have a vector space   which is the quotient of the vector space   over the subspace generated by elements of the form   for   and  .
We denote the quotient map by  . We will also use the notation   (resp.,  ) for the restriction map   (resp.,   for  ).
Further,   and   will denote the range of the maps   and   respectively. 
       
         Notation.  For any two vectors   For any two vectors   and   in any vector space, we will write   when  . 
       
        We denote the above element by  .
Note that  . 
       
        We will next unravel the multiplication in  . 
       
         Notation.  We see that   We see that   is better behaved with respect to multiplication than  .
So, we set  and the above proposition translates as: . 
       
        Next we will compute the canonical trace   on   for  .
For this, we need orthonormal basis of   for   with respect to the inner product given by

Now,   for all  .
Since   is irreducible, the space   is one-dimensional and spanned by the element the inclusion map  .
  is simply the conditional expectation  . 
       
        The definition of   then turns out to be (following  ) 
         
        We will now describe the  -structure on   which we denote by  .
From  , the definition of   is the following: 
         
        In order to describe the representations of  , we need a few more notations.

          Since the weight set   is full, we may use the relation satisfied by the quotient map   to say  .
So, by Remark  ,   can be linearly generated by elements of the form   for  .

Again, using the relation satisfied by the quotient map and setting  , we get 
          We then apply Lemma   (i) and (ii) to get 
          where the three vertically stacked discs correspond to their composition.
Once we apply the multiplication of these discs as stated in Proposition   (i), it becomes clear that the resultant (up to a unit scalar) is indeed of the form mentioned in the statement of this proposition.

          In the above expression  , using Lemma   (ii), we could make the disc in the fourth term pass through the bottom box in the third term to its top.
As a result, expression   turns out to be a scalar multiple of 
          Observe that the composition of the bottom box of the third term and the top box in the fourth term (in expression  ) is   if   and zero otherwise; this follows from Proposition  .
Similarly, Lemma   (i) allows us to move the disc in the second term up through the bottom box of the first term, and thereby the expression   becomes a scalar multiple of

The above discussion implies that in this case,   is indeed a scalar multiple of  .

          By  , we know that the representation categories of the affine algebra   and tube algebra   are equivalent although as  -algebras they are non-isomorphic.
There is one thing to notice that this representation category (appearing in Theorem  ) is also equivalent to the category of tube representations of the diagonal subfactor (as in Theorem  ) corresponding to the automorphisms  ,   of the  -factor  .
This equivalence can be seen in an alternative way: Let   be an extremal bifinite bimodule and   be its corresponding subfactor planar algebra (namely the &#8216;unimodular bimodule planar algebra&#8217;, in the sense of  ).
By Theorem 4.2 of  , the category of (Jones) affine  -modules is equivalent to the representation category of the tube algebra of   the category of bifinite  - -bimodules generated by  .
By  , the affine module categories corresponding to   and its dual   are equivalent.
On the other hand, the dual planar algebra is isomorphic to the subfactor planar algebra associated to the contragradient bimodule  .
Thus the representation category of the tube algebra of   is equivalent to that of   the category of bifinite  - -bimodules generated by  . Next, consider an intermediate extremal finite index subfactor  .
Let   denote the bifinite bimodule  .
It is easy to check that the category   of bifinite  - -bimodules generated by   is the same as those which come from the subfactor  .
Let   denote the smallest  -tensor category of bifinite  - -bimodules coming from the subfactor   as well as  .
One can verify that   is the same as the category of bifinite  - -bimodules generated by  .
Hence, from the previous paragraph, the category of tube representations of   is equivalent to that of  . Coming back to our context of Bisch-Haagerup subfactor   as set up in the beginning of this section, it remains to show that   is the  -tensor category generated by the bimodules   for  ; this is an easy computation.
