    In the MSSM, cosmological scalar field condensates
formed
along flat directions of the scalar potential (Affleck-Dine condensates)
are typically unstable with respect to formation of
Q-balls, a type of non-topological soliton. I discuss the creation
and growth of the
quantum seed
fluctuations which catalyse the collapse of the condensate.
In D-term inflation models,
the fluctuations of squark fields in the flat directions
also give rise to isocurvature
density fluctuations stored in the Affleck-Dine condensate.
After the condensate breaks up,
these can be perturbations in the baryon number, or,
in the case where the present neutralino density comes directly from
B-ball decay, perturbations in the number of
dark matter neutralinos. The latter case results in a large
enhancement of the isocurvature
perturbation, which should be observable by PLANCK.

      -derivable, approximations to relativistic field
theories. Treating the interaction field as a dynamical degree of
freedom, we derive the thermodynamical potential in terms of fully
dressed propagators, an approach which allows us to resolve the
entropy of a relativistic plasma into contributions from its
interacting elementary excitations. We illustrate the derivation
for a hot QED plasma of massless particles. We also discuss how the
self-consistency of the treatment manifests itself into
relationships between the contributions from interaction and matter
fields.

    The inflation-inspired flat, cold
dark matter-dominated models of structure formation with
adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant initial conditions agree very well
with current CMB anisotropy data. The success of these models
is highlighted by the failure of alternatives; we argue
that there are no longer any viable competitors (with the
exception of models with more complicated matter content
which are still flat and which still require inflation).
CMB data will soon be of sufficient quality that, if one assumes
inflation, one can detect a non-zero cosmological constant by
combining a determination of the peak location with
Hubble constant measurements.

parts of the apparatus. The aim of this lecture is to introduce
the types of problems to be faced in this line of research. The
attention is focused on the inertial damping of the test
mass suspension of the VIRGO interferometer (the superattenuator):
it is a multidimensional local control aimed to reduce the
residual motion of the suspended mirror associated to the normal
modes of the suspension. Its performance is very important for the
locking of the interferometer.

scalar potential; the possibility of lifting them, and their role in
constructing a viable model of inflation. Finally, we review the status

    A mass-shift of the axion propagating in an external constant homogenious
magnetic field is calculated. The contributions via an electron
loop and a virtual photon are examined. It is shown that the virtual
photon contribution dominates substantially over the electron-loop one.
Under the conditions of the early Universe the electron-loop contribution
to the massless axion mass-shift is equal to zero while the virtual
photon contribution is finite and can be of order of the recent
restrictions on the axion mass.

    Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been used as
approximate standard candles to measure cosmological parameters
such as the Hubble constant and the deceleration parameter.
These measurements rely on empirical correlations between
peak luminosities and other features that can be observed
in the supernovae spectra and their light curves.
Such correlations deserve further study since they have been
established from small samples of nearby SNIa.
Two years ago, the EROS2 collaboration launched an automated search
for supernovae with the 1m Marly telescope operating at La Silla.
In all, 57 SNe have been discovered in this EROS2 search
and spectra have been obtained for 26 of them. We found that
75% were of type Ia and 25% of type II. Using this sample, a preliminary SN
explosion rate has been obtained. Our most recent observation campaign
took place in February and March 99. It was performed in the framework
of a large consortium led by the Supernova Cosmology Project.
The aim of this intensive campaign was
to provide an independent set of high quality light curves
and spectra to study systematic effects in the measurement of
cosmological parameters. We will briefly describe our search
procedure and present the status of our ongoing analysis.

    Neutrinoless double beta decay belongs to the most sensitive tools
for the search of new physics beyond the standard model.
The recent half life limit of the Heidelberg–Moscow experiment implies
restrictive bounds on the absolute mass scale in the neutrino sector.
Possible improvements by the GENIUS project provide a unique possibility
to reconstruct the neutrino mass spectrum.
Further constraints on new interactions in the neutrino sector are given in a

    We have surveyed six distinct
‘empty fields’ using the Australia Telescope Compact
Array in an ultra-compact configuration with the aim of imaging,
with a high brightness sensitivity,
any arcmin-scale brightness-temperature anisotropies in the background
radio sky.
The six well-separated regions were observed at a frequency of 8.7 GHz and
the survey regions were limited by the ATCA primary beams which have a
full width at half maximum of 6 arcmin at this frequency; all fields were
observed with a
resolution of 2 arcmin and an rms thermal noise of 24

After subtracting foreground confusion detected in higher resolution
images of the fields,
residual fluctuations in Stokes I images are consistent with the expectations
from thermal noise and weaker (unidentified) foreground sources;
the Stokes Q and U images are consistent with expectations from thermal
noise.

    Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model
predict the existence of Q-balls, some of which can be entirely stable.
Both stable and unstable Q-balls can play an important role in cosmology.
In particular, Affleck–Dine baryogenesis can result in a copious
production of stable baryonic Q-balls, which can presently exist as a
form of dark matter. Formation and decay of unstable Q-balls can also
have some important effects on baryogenesis and phase transitions.

    The detection of the theoretically expected dark matter
is central to particle physics cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric
models provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP). Such models conmbined with fairly well
understood physics like
the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and/or the
spin response function of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of
the event rate for LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates
are, however, very low or even undetectable.
So it is imperative to exploit the modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of
the event irate on the earth’s annual motion. In this paper we study
such a modulation effect both in non directional and directional experiments.
We calculate both the differential and the total rates using symmetric as well
as asymmetric velocity distributions. We find that in the symmetric case
the modulation amplitude is small, less than 0.07. There exist, however,
regions of
the phase space and experimental conditions such that the effect can become
larger. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced velocity
dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields the bonus of an enhanced
modulation effect, with an amplitude which for certain parameters
can become as large as 0.46

the bulk of the HI resides in well-formed, optically-luminous galaxies.
At high redshift, 21cm line absorption against background radio
quasars occurs in gas-rich systems identified with the highest
HI column densities – the “damped Lyman alpha”
quasar absorption-line systems.
High spatial-resolution observations of the redshifted 21cm line absorbers

    We analyze the smallest Dirac eigenvalues by formulating
an effective theory for the QCD Dirac spectrum. We find that in
a domain where the kinetic term of the effective theory can be ignored,
the Dirac eigenvalues are distributed according to a Random Matrix Theory
with the global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The kinetic
term provides information on the slope of the average spectral density
of the Dirac operator.
In the second half of this lecture we interpret quenched
QCD Dirac spectra at nonzero chemical potential
(with eigenvalues scattered in the complex plane)
in terms of an effective low energy theory.

We implement the linear theory of cosmological perturbations
in scalar tensor gravitational theories to compute CMB
temperature and polarization spectra.
All the interesting spectral features are affected:
on sub-degree angular scales,
the acoustic peaks change both in amplitude and
position; on larger scales the low redshift dynamics enhances
the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect.
These results show how the future CMB experiments could give
information on the vacuum energy as well as on the structure of
the gravitational Lagrangian term.

    The most recent cosmological data point in the direction of a
cosmological constant dominated universe. A suitable candidate for providing
the required acceleration is a rolling scalar field
named “quintessence”. We address the issue of building a particle physics
model for quintessence in the context of Susy QCD. We then go on to ask if the
quintessence scalar can be identified with the inflaton field and give two
examples in which this is indeed the case.

    In first-order phase transitions in the early
universe, the bubble wall is expected to be significantly
slowed-down by its interaction with the surrounding plasma. We
examine the behaviour of the phase of the Higgs field after
two-bubble collisions, and find that phase differences equilibrate
much more quickly in slow-moving bubbles than in those which expand
at the speed of light. This could lead to a significant reduction
in the initial density of topological defects formed at a
first-order phase transition.

    The effects of the propagation of particles which have a
finite life-time and an according width in their mass spectrum are discussed
in the context of transport descriptions. In the first part the coupling of
soft photon modes to a source of charged particles is studied in a classical
model which can be solved completely in analytical terms. The solution
corresponds to a re-summation of certain field theory diagrams. The general
properties of broad resonances in dense finite temperature systems are
discussed at the example of the 
        
          ρ
        
      -meson in hadronic matter. The second
part addresses the problem of transport descriptions which also account for
the damping width of the particles. The Kadanoff–Baym equation after
gradient approximation together with the 
        
          Φ
        
      -derivable method of Baym
provides a self-consistent and conserving scheme. Memory effects appearing in
collision term diagrams of higher order are discussed. We derive a
generalized expression for the nonequilibrium kinetic entropy flow, which
includes corrections from fluctuations and mass-width effects. In special
cases an 
        
          H

    Four-wave mixing in the form of Bragg scattering (BS) has been predicted to enable quantum noise less frequency conversion by analytic quantum approaches. Using a semi-classical description of quantum noise that accounts for loss and stimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering, which are not currently described in existing quantum approaches, we quantify the impacts of these effects on the conversion efficiency and on the quantum noise properties of BS in terms of an induced noise figure (NF). We give an approximate closed-form expression for the BS conversion efficiency that includes loss and stimulated Raman scattering, and we derive explicit expressions for the Raman-induced NF from the semi-classical approach used here.

       colliding
experiments at LEP and SLAC [] have shown the
success of these experiments on not only impressively proving
the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model (SM),
but also to help provide stringent bounds on physics beyond
the SM. With this experience in mind, there appear two
equally fascinating opportunities for studying fermion-pair
production processes at a future Linear Collider (LC).
On the one hand,
performing high precision measurements to the SM,
for example, when running with high luminosity at the

        
          Z
        
       boson resonance, could be a quick and feasible
enterprise in order to pin down the symmetry breaking
mechanism of the electroweak sector through indirectly
determining the masses of a light SM or MSSM
Higgs boson or supersymmetric particles via
virtual corrections.
On the other hand, looking for such particles in direct
production or other ‘New Physics’ effects at energies
between, for example, roughly 500 and 800 GeV will naturally
be the main motivation to pursue the challenging endeavor of
building and utilizing such a unique facility.
These two scenarios for the LC shall be sketched here, with
particular emphasis on the semi-analytical program ZFITTER
for fermion-pair production in comparison with numerical programs
like TOPAZ0, KK2f, and others.

    It has been realized for quite a long time
that single-spin experiments,
in which one of the colliding
objects is transversely polarized,
can be helpful in studying the
properties of strong interaction in general and
in testing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in particular.
Striking effects have been observed
in the past few years which deviate drastically
from the expectation of the perturbative QCD parton model.
These effects have received much attention.
New experiments of the similar type are underway and/or planned.
Different theoretical attempts have been made
to understand these effects.
In this review, the special role played by singly polarized
high-energy hadron-hadron collisions
in High Energy Spin Physics is emphasized.
Characteristics of the
available data for inclusive hadron productions
are briefly summarized.
Different theoretical approaches for such processes
are reviewed with special attention to a non-perturbative
model which explicitly
takes the orbital motion of the valence quarks
and hadronic surface effects into account.
The connection between such asymmetries and
hyperon polarization in unpolarized reactions
is discussed.
An example of the possible application of
such experimental results in other processes is given.

    We developed a three-center phenomenological model,
able to explain
qualitatively the recently obtained experimental results concerning the
quasimolecular stage of a light-particle accompanied fission process.
It was derived from the liquid drop model under the assumption
that the aligned configuration, with the emitted particle between the
light and heavy fragment, is reached by increasing continuously
the separation distance, while the radii of the heavy fragment and of the
light particle are kept constant. In such a way,
a new minimum of a
short-lived molecular state appears in the deformation energy at a
separation distance very close to the touching point.
This minimum
allows the existence of a short-lived quasi-molecular state, decaying
into the three final fragments.

    A three-center phenomenological model able to explain, at least
from a
qualitative point of view, the difference in the observed yield of a
particle-accompanied fission and that of binary fission was developed.
It is derived from the liquid drop model under the assumption that the
aligned configuration, with the emitted particle between the
light and heavy fragment is obtained by increasing continuously
the separation distance, while the radii of the light fragment and of the
light particle are kept constant. During the first stage of the deformation
one has a two-center evolution until the neck radius becomes equal to the
radius of the emitted particle. Then the three center starts developing by
decreasing with the same amount the two tip distances.
In such a way a second minimum, typical
for a cluster molecule, appears in the deformation energy.

    The effects of dissipation on the thermodynamic properties of nonlinear
quantum systems are approached by the path-integral method in order
to construct approximate classical-like formulas for evaluating thermal
averages of thermodynamic quantities. Explicit calculations are
presented for one-particle and many-body systems. The effects of the
dissipation mechanism on the phase diagram of two-dimensional
Josephson arrays is discussed.

    The first millisecond X-ray variability phenomena from
accreting compact objects have recently been discovered with the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer. Three new phenomena are observed from low-mass
X-ray binaries containing low-magnetic-field neutron stars:
millisecond pulsations, burst oscillations and kiloHertz
quasi-periodic oscillations. Models for these new phenomena involve
the neutron star spin, and orbital motion closely around the neutron
star and rely explicitly on our understanding of strong gravity and
dense matter. I review the observations of these new neutron-star
phenomena and possibly related ones in black-hole candidates, and
describe the attempts to use them to perform measurements of
fundamental physical interest in these systems.

    Galaxy structures are certainly fractal

              0
            
          
        
      .
A clear determination of such a scale is still missing.
Usually the conceptual and practical implications of this
property are neglected and the structures are only discussed in
terms of their global amplitude.
Here we present a compact summary of these implications.
First, we discuss the problem of the identification of the crossover
scale 
        
          λ
          
            
              0
            
          
        
       and the proper characterization
of the scaling. We then consider the implications
of these properties with respect to various physical phenomena
and to the corresponding characteristic values,
i.e. 
        
          r
          
            
              0

      , 
        
          Ω
        
      , etc. These implications
crucially depend on the value of 
        
          λ
          
            
              0
            
          
        
      , but they are
still important for a relatively small value, say

        
          λ
          
            
              0

Finally we consider the main theoretical
consequences of these results.

enhanced in the thermodynamic limit. In any other model (including
homogeneous models) the binding in the thermodynamic limit is small or
neglible. By including these inhomogeneous terms we can reproduce experimental
neutron scattering data. We also discuss the connection of the
resulting inhomogeneity-induced superconductivity to recent
experimental evidence for a linear relation between magnetic
incommensurability and the superconducting transition temperature, as a
function of doping.

    The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry remains one of
the most fundamental problems of cosmology. In this talk I present a
novel scenario for baryogenesis at the electroweak scale, without the
need for a first order phase transition. It is based on the out of
equilibrium resonant production of long wavelength Higgs and gauge
configurations, at the end of a period of inflation, which induces a
large rate of sphaleron transitions, before thermalization at a
temperature below critical.

    We study the out of equilibrium dynamics of
inflationary phase transitions and compute the resulting spectrum
of metric perturbations relevant to observation. We show that
simple single field models of inflation may produce an adiabatic
perturbation spectrum with a blue spectral tilt and that the precise
spectrum depends on initial conditions at the outset of inflation.

    SUSY effects on various flavor
changing neutral current processes are discussed in
the minimal supergravity model and the SU(5) grand unified theory
with right-handed neutrino supermultiplets.
In particular, in the latter case the neutrino Yukawa coupling
constants can be a source of the flavor mixing in the
right-handed-down-type-squark sector. It is shown that due to this
mixing the time-dependent CP asymmetry of radiative

    R-parity violation in the supersymmetric standard model
could be the origin of neutrino masses and mixing accounting for
the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations.
More interestingly, this hypothesis may be tested in future colliders
by detecting lepton number violating decays of the lightest
supersymmetric particle. Here, we present a
comprehensive analysis for the determination of sneutrino
vacuum expectation values from the one-loop effective scalar potential,
and also for the one-loop renormalization of neutrino masses and mixing.
Applying our results to theories with gauge mediated supersymmetry
breaking, we discuss the effects of the one-loop corrections and
how the realistic neutrino mass matrices arise.

Report No. UNIL-IPT/00-02 (Feb 2000)
is a status report on our study of
quantum transport equations relevant for baryogenesis computations.
Our main finding is that, as a consequence of localization in space,
the quasiparticle picture of the plasma dynamics breaks down at first
non-trivial order in gradient expansion. While in this talk we
focus on bosons, we expect that a similar picture holds for
fermions. We then argue that the quasiparticle picture is recovered in
the adiabatic limit of frequent scattering.
