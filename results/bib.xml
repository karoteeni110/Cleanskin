  </creator><abstract>
     The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a structured repository of concepts (HPO Terms) that are associated to one or more diseases. The process of association is referred to as annotation. The relevance and the specificity of both HPO terms and annotations are evaluated by a measure defined as Information Content (IC). The analysis of annotated data is thus an important challenge for bioinformatics. There exist different approaches of analysis. From those, the use of Association Rules (AR) may provide useful knowledge, and it has been used in some applications, e.g. improving the quality of annotations. Nevertheless classical association rules algorithms do not take into account the source of annotation nor the importance yielding to the generation of candidate rules with low IC. This paper presents HPO-Miner (Human Phenotype Ontology-based Weighted Association Rules) a methodology for extracting Weighted Association Rules. HPO-Miner can extract relevant rules from a biological point of view. A case study on using of HPO-Miner on publicly available HPO annotation datasets is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology.

       In computer science, the term ontology defines a set of representational primitives with which to model a domain of knowledge or discourse  . In particular, ontologies are mainly used in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
    </para><para>
       For instance, the Gene Ontology aims to provide a common language to describe genes product  . More recently, the annotation efforts have also focused on the description of relation among molecular biology and disease, leading to the introduction of novel ontologies such as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)   and Disease Ontology (DO)  . 
    </para><para>
       HPO aims to provide a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. A generic HPO annotation contains a link between a disease and phenotypic abnormality. A disease is indexed by using a unified identifier known as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). OMIM is a comprehensive, authoritative compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes that are freely available and updated daily  . The Disease Ontology (DO) has been developed as a standardized ontology for human disease with the purpose of providing strong and sustainable descriptions of human disease terms and phenotype characteristics  . 
    </para><para>
       The amount of annotations available is steadily growing, raising new challenges to face, related to ambiguous or incomplete annotations and ontology terms  . The annotation task is becoming an even harder challenge in the genomic era, which is characterized by an unprecedented growth in the production of genes, gene products, and even other information. To speed-up the updating and maintenance processes of ontologies and annotations, it is required the development of computational approaches that guarantee a remarkable speed, on the current approaches of annotation carried out manually by the curators.
The literature contains several computational methods developed to aid GO curators to improve GO annotations consistency  ,  ,  . As opposed to GO, in literature, there are only a few automatic methodologies able to aid the HPO curators to improve annotation consistency and retrieve link between terms not explicitly related. 
    </para><para>
       As demonstrated in some recent works by Faria et al.  , by Manda et al.  , and by Agapito et al.  , association rules may be used to improve annotations consistency and highlight relationships among terms did not seem explicitly related. In this work, we present HPO-Miner an improvement of our previous works in which we introduced GO-WAR  . HPO-Miner is a tool for learning weighted association rules (WAR) to check annotation consistency and to identify hidden relationships between two phenotype abnormalities from HPO.
Traditional association rule approaches are not able to distinguish between items; they are unaware of the relevance of terms yielding to the generation of rules with low specificity. The specificity of each term may be measured by the information content (IC) of a term  . The use of IC computed for each HPO term, is a measure of the specificity of a term, yielding to the IC-weighted annotation as conveyed in the following:  OMIM100100: (HP:0000126, 11.18), (HP:0000144, 9.57) .
HPO-Miner is able to extract weighted association rules starting from an annotated dataset of diseases. The proposed approach is based on the following steps: (i) initially we rearrange the information for each OMIM term to get transactional data; (ii) then, we extract weighted association rules using a modified  .

      <para>
         HPO is a structured and controlled vocabulary with more than 10,000 terms able to describe the phenotypic abnormalities in human diseases. HPO provides annotations of more than 7,000 human hereditary syndromes and other phenotypic abnormalities that characterize the diseases, are also available at the website   http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org .
HPO consists of three independent sub-ontologies: the  .
HPO consists of three independent sub-ontologies: the  mode of inheritance  i.e. the way in which a specific hereditary attribute is transmitted from a generation to another,   i.e. the way in which a specific hereditary attribute is transmitted from a generation to another,  onset and clinical course  i.e. in medicine refers to the first symptoms of a sickness and the medical treatments involved to cure them and finally, the   i.e. in medicine refers to the first symptoms of a sickness and the medical treatments involved to cure them and finally, the  phenotypic abnormalities  i.e. the abnormal traits of a living organism that are possible to observe. As other ontologies, terms in HPO are organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The relations among DAG&#8217;s terms are modelled by means of   i.e. the abnormal traits of a living organism that are possible to observe. As other ontologies, terms in HPO are organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The relations among DAG&#8217;s terms are modelled by means of  is_a  and   and  part_of  edges &#8221;relations&#8221;, in order to distinguish between general or specific terms. Moreover, terms in HPO are arranged in a hierarchical way, where each path respects the   edges &#8221;relations&#8221;, in order to distinguish between general or specific terms. Moreover, terms in HPO are arranged in a hierarchical way, where each path respects the  true-path-rule . To each HPO class is assigned a stable and unique identifier (e.g.  . To each HPO class is assigned a stable and unique identifier (e.g.  HP:0001629 ), a label and a list of synonyms, describing a well definite phenotypic abnormality i.e. &#8221; ), a label and a list of synonyms, describing a well definite phenotypic abnormality i.e. &#8221; Ventricular Septal Defect &#8221; see Figure  &#8221; see Figure  . 
      </para><para>
         Diseases are annotated with terms of the HPO, meaning that HPO terms are used to describe all the signs, symptoms, and other phenotypic manifestations that characterize the disease in question. 
      </para><para>
         The annotations of OMIM entries are a mixture of manual annotations performed by the HPO curators team and automated matching of the OMIM Clinical Synopsis to HPO term labels. In particular HPO is an ontology designed to provide qualitative information and not to capture quantitative information such as body weight or height. Each diseases may be annotated to multiple HPO terms.
Consequently the need of the introduction of methodologies and tools to support HPO curators to improve annotation consistency and the structure of the ontology arises.

    <subsection title="Association Rules">
      <para>
         Association Rule (AR) extraction is very popular in data mining, it is used for discovering associations in market basket analysis and unknown relations among features in databases. Historically, was proposed by Agrawal   to discovery associations to support marketing decision. 
      </para><para>
         Formally, the association rules extraction problem may be stated as follows: let   be a set of items and   a transactional database that contains a set of transactions, where a transaction   is a subset of items belonging to  . An association rule is an implication of the form  , where   and   are two disjoint sets. AR are based on two fundamental properties to define the relevance of the mined rules,  Support  and   and  Confidence .
The formal Support definition is: .
The formal Support definition is:

        </para></theorem>

         Where   is the total number of transactions contained in   and   is called  support count , namely, the number of transaction that contain a particular item.
 , namely, the number of transaction that contain a particular item.
 The Confidence is defined as: 
      </para><theorem title=".">
        <para>
            . 
        </para></theorem>
      <para>
         Where   is the number of transactions in  D  containing A and   containing A and   is the number of transactions in  D  that contains both items A and B.  that contains both items A and B. 
      </para><para>
         A drawback with the use of classical AR approach is that it precludes the derivation of certain rules in which the items have a very different levels of support. In several areas do not make sense to assign equal importance to all items involved in the dataset. For example in the supermarket context, some items like computer, smartphone have much value than trivial items like ice-cream or butter. Rules involving smartphone or computer have less support than those involving butter or ice-cream but are much more significant in term of profit by the store. In the ontology context, the term HP:0000924 ( An abnormality of the skeletal system ) has a relevance value (IC value) lower than HP:0011803 ( ) has a relevance value (IC value) lower than HP:0011803 ( Bifid nose ) although it is much more frequent. Rules involving the term HP:0000924 are less interesting (as it is a more general term) then rules involving the term HP:0011803 (as it is a more specific term) in terms of actionable knowledge. ) although it is much more frequent. Rules involving the term HP:0000924 are less interesting (as it is a more general term) then rules involving the term HP:0011803 (as it is a more specific term) in terms of actionable knowledge. 
      </para><para>
         This limitation of classical AR approach can be overcome by introducing the weighted association rules (WAR). WAR models the  significance  of a term by means of a   of a term by means of a  weight  (  ( ). A weight ( ) is a positive real number that reflect the relevance of a HPO terms, for which high values represent very significant items as reported in  . In our case, the relevance can be represented by using the information content ( IC ). ). 
      </para><para>
         A generic HPO dataset is a list of  OMIM  identifiers annotated with multiple HPO terms, as conveyed in Figure   identifiers annotated with multiple HPO terms, as conveyed in Figure  . 
      </para><para>
         In order to extract rules from the HPO dataset, it is necessary to convert it in a format more suitable to represent transaction data. The conversion consists in put together the same OMIM identifiers that became the transaction  identifier  while the HPO terms associated with the current OMIM identifier are the items of the transaction, as depicted in Figure   while the HPO terms associated with the current OMIM identifier are the items of the transaction, as depicted in Figure  .

    <subsection title="Weighting HPO term with Information Content">
      <para>
         Each HP term is associated to IC value. There exist different IC formulations that fall into two classes, intrinsic and extrinsic methods. Intrinsic method rely on the topology of the GO graph analyzing the positions of terms in a taxonomy. In this way the approaches define information content for each term. Different topological characteristics as ancestors, number of children, depth (see  for a complete review) can used in order to estimate the Intrinsic IC calculus. Instead the extrinsic approaches involve annotation data for an considered corpus.
In this work we used the intrinsic method proposed by Sanchez et al.  , Harispe et al. , Resnick et al.  , Seco et al.  , Zhou et al.  . 
      </para><para>
         The measure of Sanchez exploits only the number of leaves and the set of ancestors of   including itself,  subsumers(a)  and introduce the root node as the number of leaves   and introduce the root node as the number of leaves  max_leaves  in IC assessment. Leaves are more informative than concepts with many leaves, roots, so the leaves are suited to describe and to distinguish any concept.  in IC assessment. Leaves are more informative than concepts with many leaves, roots, so the leaves are suited to describe and to distinguish any concept. 
        </para><para>
         Harispe et al., in oder to highlights the specificity of leaves according to their number of ancestors, consider  leaves(a)  =   =  a  concept when   concept when  a  is a root and evaluating   is a root and evaluating  max_leaves  as the number of inclusive ancestors of a node revising the IC assessment suggested by Sanchez et al.  as the number of inclusive ancestors of a node revising the IC assessment suggested by Sanchez et al.

         The formulation provided from Resnick et al. computes the IC of a concept evaluating all the top-downs path from a concept   to the reachable leaves,  , and then calculates the log yielding to the formula:

         Seco et al. calculate the IC of a concept by considering the ratio between the number of hyponyms in ontology, for example, the number of descendant with respect to the whole number of ontological concepts.

         Thus Zhou et al. considers the depth of a concept in a taxonomy,  depth(a) , and the maximum depth of the taxonomy  , and the maximum depth of the taxonomy  max_depth . . 
         In this formulation K is a factor which enables to weight the contribution of the two evaluated features.

We chose these tools because both provides an implementation of the FP-Growth algorithm a necessary condition in order to fairly compare HPO-Miner with both tools. The FP-Growth algorithm implementation in Weka and Knime, is able to handle only binary attributes, making both tools unable to analyze weighted HPO datasets enriched with IC values. A possible way to make weighted HPO enriched dataset compatible with Weka and Knime is to leave for each OMIM entry only two HPO terms, making this solution infeasible because leads to lose a lot of useful information.
Differently, HPO-Miner is the only tool that comes with a version of FP-Growth able to handle a generic number of attribute for each OMIM entry, making it suitable to analyze HPO dataset enriched with IC values.

  <section title="Conclusion">
    <para>
       We presented a new methodology based on weighted association rule for HPO data analysis that takes into account the relevance of terms; the relevance is a weight assigned to a term based on, for example, its specificity to describe a phenotypic abnormality. The relevance of a HPO term, is obtained by computing the IC value related with each term. We presented the outline of an algorithm called HPO-Miner to mine weighted itemsets that have sufficient weighted supports. These itemsets are used in turn to generate association rules that have high weighted support. Finally, the relevance of the mined rules by HPO-Miner, is proved by the evidences found analyzing the literature.
