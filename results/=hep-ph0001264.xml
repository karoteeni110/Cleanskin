    <abstract>
      <p>In the present lectures the following topics
are considered: general properties of neutrinos, neutrino mass phenomenology
(Dirac and Majorana masses), neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of
the standard model (including the seesaw mechanism), neutrino oscillations in
vacuum, neutrino oscillations in matter (the MSW effect) in 2- and
3-flavour schemes, implications of CP, T and CPT symmetries for neutrino
oscillations, double beta decay, solar neutrino oscillations and the solar
neutrino problem, and atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a short overview of
the results of the accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments and of future
projects. Finally, we discuss how the available experimental data on neutrino
masses and lepton mixing can be summarized in the phenomenologically
allowed forms of the neutrino mass matrix.</p>

      <p>Neutrino physics is a very active field now, both experimentally and
theoretically. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment was put
into operation in 1999; it should add a very important information to
our knowledge of solar neutrinos. The SNO experiment and the forthcoming
Borexino experiment will complement the already existing data of Homestake,
Gallex, SAGE, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments and this will
hopefully lead to the resolution of the long-standing solar neutrino problem.
The first long baseline terrestrial neutrino experiment, K2K, has already
started taking data, and several more experiments &#8211; KamLAND, MINOS,
MiniBooNE and CERN &#8211; Gran Sasso experiments are either scheduled to start
in a very near future or in advanced stage of planning. There are also very
wide discussions of possible next generation long baseline experiments with
muon storage rings </p>

      <p>On the theoretical side, there have been many analyses of the available
experimental data and predictions for the forthcoming experiments made
within various scenarios for neutrino properties, studies of neutrino-related
processes in stars and supernovae, phenomenological studies of the allowed
structures of neutrino mass matrices and developments of particle physics
models capable of producing the requisite mass matrices.</p>

      <p>Why are we so much interested in neutrinos? Neutrinos play a very important
role in various branches of subatomic physics as well as in astrophysics
and cosmology. The smallness of neutrino mass is very likely related to
existence of new, yet unexplored mass scales in particle
physics. These scales are so high that their direct experimental study
may not ever be possible. Neutrinos can provide us with a very valuable,
though indirect, information about these mass scales and the new physics
related to these scales. In fact, they may even hold a clue to the general
problem of the fermion mass generation.</p>

neutrino mass phenomenology, neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of
the standard model (including the seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass
generation), neutrino oscillations in vacuum,
neutrino oscillations in matter (the MSW effect), implications of CP, T and
CPT symmetries for neutrino oscillations, solar neutrino oscillations and
the solar neutrino problem, and atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a
short overview of the results of the accelerator and reactor neutrino
experiments and of future projects. Finally, we discuss how the available
experimental data on neutrino masses and lepton mixing can be summarized in
the phenomenologically allowed forms of the neutrino mass matrix. Except for
the simplest extensions of the standard models, we do not discuss the models
of neutrino mass since they were covered in the lectures of K.S. Babu at
this school </p>

state has a certain momentum. Since it is a mixture of different mass
eigenstates, its energy is not well defined in this case. We then consider
the time evolution of the neutrino state. Alternatively, one could assume that
the neutrino is produced in a state of a certain energy but not well defined
momentum, and consider the evolution of the neutrino system in space. For
relativistic neutrinos the result will be the same. Which description is more
correct? Does the initially produced state have a certain energy or a certain
momentum? In general, since the production process takes finite time and is
localized in space, neither neutrino energy nor momentum is well defined;
moreover, the transition probability depends on both the neutrino production
and detection processes. Fortunately, for relativistic neutrinos these
subtleties are unimportant, and the simple description in terms of the states
with certain momentum or energy gives the correct answer

derived in the limit <ref labelref="LABEL:asymm2" />) the probability asymmetry is cubic (more precisely,
tri-linear) in small phases rather than linear. Another important difference
between the usual oscillation probabilities and the CP-odd asymmetry
(<ref labelref="LABEL:asymm2" />) is that while the former contain squared sines of the
oscillation phases and therefore oscillate near non-zero average values,
the latter is linear in these sines and so oscillates around zero. This means
that in the case of very large oscillation phases, when the averaging
regime sets in, the CP-odd asymmetry of neutrino oscillations averages to
zero. It is for this reason that the oscillation probability (<ref labelref="LABEL:prob7" />)

        <p>It follows from the above discussion that the experimental observation of
CP violation effect in neutrino oscillations is a very difficult task. The
CP-odd probability asymmetry is suppressed if any one of the three lepton
mixing angles is small, and we know from the CHOOZ reactor neutrino experiment
that the mixing angle <ref labelref="LABEL:reacc" /> below
for a discussion of the reactor and accelerator data). The atmospheric neutrino
experiments indicate that the mixing angle <ref labelref="LABEL:hier" />) of the mass squared differences which follows from the solar

of CP violation in the neutrino oscillation experiments. In addition, matter
effects on neutrino oscillations may mimic CP violation and so make the
searches of the genuine CP violation even more difficult (see sec.
<ref labelref="LABEL:3flmatt" />). Still, the presently allowed values of neutrino parameters
do not exclude a possibility of observation of CP violation effects in the
future neutrino experiments. Discovering CP-nonconservation in the leptonic
sector would be of great importance, so the goal is worth pursuing.</p>

due to an insufficient knowledge of solar physics or an error in some input

some unknown neutrino physics (particle physics solution of the solar

that neutrinos are quasi-degenerate in mass, and only their mass squared
differences satisfy the hierarchies shown in figs. <ref labelref="LABEL:schemes1" /> and

the lower-lying of the mass eigenstates <ref labelref="LABEL:matter" />, if this condition is not satisfied, the MSW resonance
