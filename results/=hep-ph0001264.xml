      In the present lectures the following topics
are considered: general properties of neutrinos, neutrino mass phenomenology
(Dirac and Majorana masses), neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of
the standard model (including the seesaw mechanism), neutrino oscillations in
vacuum, neutrino oscillations in matter (the MSW effect) in 2- and
3-flavour schemes, implications of CP, T and CPT symmetries for neutrino
oscillations, double beta decay, solar neutrino oscillations and the solar
neutrino problem, and atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a short overview of
the results of the accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments and of future
projects. Finally, we discuss how the available experimental data on neutrino
masses and lepton mixing can be summarized in the phenomenologically
allowed forms of the neutrino mass matrix.

    Introduction

    
      In June of 1998 a very important event in neutrino physics occured &#8211; the
Super-Kamiokande collaboration reported a strong evidence for neutrino
oscillations in their atmospheric neutrino data . This was not a
thunderstorm in a clear sky: the evidence for oscillating neutrinos has been
mounting during the last two decades in the solar neutrino experiments
, and previous data on atmospheric neutrinos also gave indications
in favour of neutrino oscillations . In addition, the LSND
Collaboration has reported
an evidence for  and  oscillations in their accelerator neutrino experiment
. However, it was the Super-Kamiokande experiment that, for the
first time, not only showed with a high statistics the deficit of the
detected neutrino flux compared to expectations, but also demonstrated that
this deficit depends on the neutrino pathlength and energy in the way it
is expected to depend in the case of neutrino oscillations. Since neutrinos
are massless in the standard model of electroweak interactions, the
evidence for neutrino oscillations (and therefore for neutrino mass) is
the first strong evidence for physics beyond the standard model.
    
    
      Neutrino physics is a very active field now, both experimentally and
theoretically. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment was put
into operation in 1999; it should add a very important information to
our knowledge of solar neutrinos. The SNO experiment and the forthcoming
Borexino experiment will complement the already existing data of Homestake,
Gallex, SAGE, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments and this will
hopefully lead to the resolution of the long-standing solar neutrino problem.
The first long baseline terrestrial neutrino experiment, K2K, has already
started taking data, and several more experiments &#8211; KamLAND, MINOS,
MiniBooNE and CERN &#8211; Gran Sasso experiments are either scheduled to start
in a very near future or in advanced stage of planning. There are also very
wide discussions of possible next generation long baseline experiments with
muon storage rings . All these experiments are designed to
probe a wide range of the neutrino mass squared differences
and lepton mixing angles, and possibly CP-violating effects in neutrino
oscillations. They may also be able to test the fascinating possibility of
matter enhancement of neutrino oscillations &#8211; the MSW effect .
    
    
      On the theoretical side, there have been many analyses of the available
experimental data and predictions for the forthcoming experiments made
within various scenarios for neutrino properties, studies of neutrino-related
processes in stars and supernovae, phenomenological studies of the allowed
structures of neutrino mass matrices and developments of particle physics
models capable of producing the requisite mass matrices.
    
    
      Why are we so much interested in neutrinos? Neutrinos play a very important
role in various branches of subatomic physics as well as in astrophysics
and cosmology. The smallness of neutrino mass is very likely related to
existence of new, yet unexplored mass scales in particle
physics. These scales are so high that their direct experimental study
may not ever be possible. Neutrinos can provide us with a very valuable,
though indirect, information about these mass scales and the new physics
related to these scales. In fact, they may even hold a clue to the general
problem of the fermion mass generation.
    
    
      There are intricate relationships between neutrino physics and nuclear
physics. The existence of neutrinos was first theoretically suggested to
explain apparent energy nonconservation and wrong spin-statistics relations
in nuclear beta decay; inverse beta decay processes were used for the
first experimental detections of reactor antineutrinos and solar neutrinos.
The chiral nature of neutrinos, parity nonconservation and  structure
of weak interactions were also established in nuclear physics experiments
. Neutrino-nuclear reactions serve as a very clean probe
of nuclear and nucleon structure; on the other hand, nuclear physics
provides us with the knowledge of the reaction cross sections which is
very important for calculating the solar neutrino fluxes and neutrino
detection rates.
    
    
      Neutrinos play a very important role in astrophysics and cosmology. They carry
away up to  of the energy released in the type II supernova explosions
and therefore dominate the supernova energetics. Neutrino reactions play a
crucial role in the mechanism of supernova explosions.
Neutrinos are copiously produced in thermonuclear reactions which
occur in the stellar interior and in particular in our sun. Solar neutrinos
carry information about the core of the sun which is unaccessible to direct
optical observations. The detection of solar neutrinos has confirmed the
hypothesis that the sun is powered by thermonuclear reactions.
At the same time, the sun and supernovae give us a possibility of studying
neutrino properties over extremely long baselines
and probe the neutrino mass differences as small as  eV
or even smaller, beyond the reach of the terrestrial neutrino experiments.
    
    
      The big bang nucleosynthesis depends sensitively on neutrino interactions and
on the number of light neutrino species. Neutrinos of the mass  eV could constitute the so-called hot dark matter and may be important for
galaxy formation. Neutrinos may also play an important role in baryogenesis:
the observed excess of baryons over antibaryons in the universe may be related
to decays of heavy Majorana neutrinos.
    
    
      In the present lecture notes a number of issues pertaining to neutrino
physics are considered. These include general properties of neutrinos,
neutrino mass phenomenology, neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of
the standard model (including the seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass
generation), neutrino oscillations in vacuum,
neutrino oscillations in matter (the MSW effect), implications of CP, T and
CPT symmetries for neutrino oscillations, solar neutrino oscillations and
the solar neutrino problem, and atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a
short overview of the results of the accelerator and reactor neutrino
experiments and of future projects. Finally, we discuss how the available
experimental data on neutrino masses and lepton mixing can be summarized in
the phenomenologically allowed forms of the neutrino mass matrix. Except for
the simplest extensions of the standard models, we do not discuss the models
of neutrino mass since they were covered in the lectures of K.S. Babu at
this school  (see also  for recent reviews).
Astrophysical implications are limited to the
solar neutrino problem; other issues of neutrino astrophysics were discussed
in the lectures of T.P. Walker , and additional information can
be found, e.g. in . We do not discuss neutrino
electromagnetic properties and their implications because of the lack
of space. Some material on these issues can be found in .
Informative reviews and monographs on neutrino physics include (but are
not limited to) .

    General properties of neutrinos

    
      What do we know about neutrinos? Neutrinos are electrically neutral particles
of spin 1/2. There are at least three species (or flavours) of
very light neutrinos, ,  and , which are
left handed,
and their antiparticles ,  and ,
which are right handed.
Electron-type neutrinos and antineutrinos are produced in nuclear 
decay,
      
      and in particular in the neutron decay process .
They are also produced in muon decays , and as a subdominant mode, in pion decays
 and in some other decays and
reactions.
The elementary processes responsible for the nuclear beta decays or pion
decays are actually the quark transitions  and
. Muon neutrinos and antineutrinos are produced
in muon decays, pion decays 
and some other processes. Neutrinos of the third type, tau,
are expected to be produced in  decays. They have not been
experimentally detected yet
The DONUT experiment at Fermilab is looking for  and at
present has several candidate events.,
but there is no doubt in their existence.
Neutrinos of each flavour participate in reactions in which the charged lepton
of the corresponding type are involved; these reactions are mediated by
 bosons. Thus, these so-called charged current reactions involve the
processes  where  or
, or related processes. Neutrinos can also participate in neutral
current reactions mediated by  bosons; these are elastic or quasielastic
scattering processes and decays .
    
    
      The latter process allowed us to count the number of light neutrino species
that have the usual electroweak interactions. Indeed, neutrinos from the
 decays are not detected, and therefore the difference between the
measured total width of the  boson and the sum of its partial widths
of decay into quarks and charged leptons, the so-called invisible width,
 MeV, should be due to
the decay into  pairs. Taking into
account that the partial width of  decay into one  pair
 MeV one finds the number of the light active
neutrino species :
      
      in a very good agreement with the existence of the three neutrino flavours.
There are also indirect limits on the number of light ( MeV)
neutrino species (including possible electroweak singlet, i.e. &#8220;sterile&#8221;
neutrinos) coming from big bang nucleosynthesis:
      
      though this limit is less reliable than the laboratory one (),
and probably four neutrino species can still be tolerated .
    
    
    
      What do we know about the neutrino mass? Direct kinematic searches of
neutrino mass produced only the upper limits :
      
      
      
      Here ,  and  are the primary mass components of
,  and , respectively.
The limits in eqs. () and () come from
the comparison of the total energy release with the energy of decay products.
The limits in eq. () are obtained from the tritium beta decay
experiments and are based on the analyses of the so-called Kurie plot.
The electron spectrum in the allowed  decay is
      
      Here  is the well known function which takes into account
the interaction between the emitted electron and the nucleus in the final
state and  is the energy release. Thus, the shape of the 
spectrum should depend on whether or not neutrinos have a mass.
It follows from these equations that the plot of the Kurie function
 versus  should be a
straight line when  but should have a different shape close to the
endpoint of the spectrum when  (fig. ). Analyses
of the Kurie plots for beta decay of tritium which has a very low energy
release give the results of eq. (). However, all the
experiments showed some excess of the number of electrons near the
endpoint of the spectrum rather than a deficiency that is expected if
. This excess is most likely due to unknown systematic
effects. For this reason the conservative upper limit on the lightest
neutrino mass recommended by the Particle Data Group  is
      
      rather than the limits in ().
    
    
      Are neutrinos Dirac particles (like quarks or charged leptons) or Majorana
particles? In other words, can neutrinos be their own antiparticles?
It is known experimentally that
neutrinos emitted in  decay (which we call electron antineutrinos)
cannot be captured in reactions which are caused by electron neutrinos;
for example, the reaction ClAr does
not occur, whereas the reaction ClAr
does, and in fact was used in the first experiment to detect the solar
neutrinos. Does this mean that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos,
i.e. cannot be Majorana particles? Not necessarily. The reason is that the
weak interactions that are responsible for neutrino interactions are chiral
(): in the Cl-Ar reaction mentioned above, only neutrinos of left handed
chirality can be detected. The particles which we call  are
right handed, i.e. have the &#8220;wrong chirality&#8221;, and so cannot participate
in the Cl-Ar reaction (this is called &#8220;chiral prohibition&#8221;). If neutrinos
are massive, the chirality (i.e. ) is not a good quantum number,
and an electron antineutrino which was produced right handed can develop a
small left handed component, so that the reaction ClAr can become possible. However, the &#8220;wrong chirality&#8221;
admixture is of the order , i.e. extremely small due to the
smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical beta decay energies.
Therefore the probability of the ClAr
process should be suppressed by the factor ,
which can be the reason for its non-observation.
    
    
    
      On of the most outstanding manifestations of the chiral prohibition rule
are the decays of charged pions. They also show that one should carefully
discriminate between the chirality () and helicity, which
is the projection of the spin of the particle on its momentum.
In the limit of massless fermions they coincide, but for massive fermions
they do not (see Problem 1 in the next section). Let us assume that
neutrinos are massless and consider the decay  of
pions at rest, where  is  or  and  is the
corresponding neutrino.
The  structure of weak interactions requires the emitted  to be
of left handed chirality. For  this also means that it has the left
handed (or negative) helicity with its spin antiparallel to its momentum.
Conservation of total angular momentum then requires  to be of negative
helicity, too (see fig. ). However, the  are antiparticles,
and due to the  structure of weak interactions they must be produced in
the states of right handed chirality. Therefore the amplitude of the process
must be proportional to the admixture of right handed chirality in left handed
(negative) helicity of the charged lepton, i.e. to its mass: . We therefore expect
      
      where we have taken into account the difference of the phase space factors
for the decays into  and . Experimentally we have
      
      in a very good agreement with the theoretical prediction; the 4%
difference is actually due to the fact that () does not
include radiation corrections.
    
    
      Neutrinos are elusive particles, and neutrino experiments
are very difficult. This is because the interactions of neutrinos are
mediated by heavy  and  bosons and so at low energies
they are very weak. The mean free path of a 1 MeV neutrino in lead is
about 1 light year! Therefore neutrino detection requires very large
detectors and/or very intense neutrino beams.
    
    
      What are the main sources of neutrinos? One of the strongest neutrino sources
is our sun. It emits about  electron neutrinos per second,
leading to the neutrino flux at the surface of the earth of   in the energy range  MeV and   in the energy range 0.8 MeV 
MeV. Nuclear power plants are a powerful source of electron antineutrinos.
A 3 GW plant emits about   of the energy
 a few MeV per second and creates a flux of 
 at 100 . At remote locations the averaged 
number density created by all nuclear power plants on the earth is about
 . The relic neutrinos, i.e. the neutrinos left
over from the early epochs of the evolution of the universe, have a number
density of about 110  for each neutrino species and a black-body
spectrum with the average energy of about  eV. Natural
radioactivity of the earth results in the flux of 
 (or number density of  ) of
neutrinos of the energy  MeV. The flux of atmospheric neutrinos at
the earth&#8217;s surface is  . An important
tool for studying neutrino properties are particle accelerators which produce
neutrino beams of the energy ranging typically between 30 MeV and 30 GeV.
Finally, a very rare and short-lived but yet a very important source of
neutrinos are type II supernovae. They emit  neutrinos
and antineutrinos of all flavours over the time interval of about 10 
and with the typical energies  MeV. Observation of the neutrino
burst from the supernova 1987A allowed us to obtain important constraints
on neutrino properties.

    Neutrino mass phenomenology: Weyl, Dirac and Majorana neutrinos

    
      A massless neutrino (or any other fermion) is described by a two-component
Weyl spinor field. It has a certain chirality,  or . The chirality
projector operators  are defined as
      
      and have the following properties:
      
      The terms &#8220;left handed&#8221; and &#8220;right handed&#8221; originate from the fact that
for relativistic particles chirality almost coincides with helicity
defined as the projection of the spin of the particle on its momentum.
The corresponding projection operators are
      
      They satisfy relations similar to ().
For a free fermion, helicity is conserved but chirality in general is not;
it is only conserved in the limit  when it coincides with helicity.
However, for relativistic particles chirality is nearly conserved and
the description in terms of chiral states is useful.
    
    
      Problem 1. Using plane wave solutions of the Dirac equation show that
for positive energy solutions, in the limit , eigenstates of L (R)
chirality coincide with the eigenstates of negative (positive) helicity.
    
    
      For our discussion we will need the particle - antiparticle conjugation
operator . Its action on a fermion field  is defined
through
      
      The matrix  has the properties
      
      Some useful relations based on these properties are
      
      where , ,  are 4-component fermion fields and
 is an arbitrary  matrix. Using the commutation properties
of the Dirac  matrices it is easy to see that, acting on a chiral
field,  flips its chirality:
      
      i.e. the antiparticle of a left handed fermion is right handed.
    
    
      Problem 2. Prove eqs. () and ().
    
    
      The particle - antiparticle conjugation operation  must not be
confused with the charge conjugation operation
C which, by
definition, flips all the charge-like quantum numbers of a field (electric
charge, baryon number, lepton number, etc.) but leaves all the other
quantum numbers (e.g., chirality) intact. In particular, charge conjugation
would take a left handed neutrino into a left handed antineutrino that does
not exist, which is a consequence of the C-noninvariance
of weak interactions. At the same time, particle - antiparticle conjugation
converts a left handed neutrino into right handed antineutrino which does
exist and is the antiparticle of the left handed neutrino.
    
    
      We are now ready to discuss the Dirac and Majorana mass terms.
For a massive fermion, the mass term in the Lagrangian has the form
      
      Thus, the mass terms couple the left handed and right handed components of
the fermion field, and therefore a massive field must have both components:
      
      Now, there are essentially two possibilities. First, the right handed
component of a massive field can be completely independent of the left
handed one; in this case we have a Dirac field.
Second, the right handed field can be
just a  - conjugate of the left handed one: , or
      
      where we have included the phase factor  with an
arbitrary phase .
In this case we have a Majorana field; one can construct
it with just one Weyl field. From () it immediately follows that
the  - conjugate field coincides with itself up to a phase factor:
      
      This means that particles described by Majorana fields are genuinely
neutral, i.e. coincide with their antiparticles. Thus, Majorana particles
are fermionic analogs of photons and  mesons. To construct a massive
Dirac field, one needs two independent 2-component Weyl fields,  and
; together with their -conjugates, 
and , this gives four degrees of freedom. In
contrast with this, a Majorana fermion has only two degrees of freedom,
 and .
    
    
      For massive fermions, particle - antiparticle conjugation 
and charge conjugation C coincide. For Dirac fermions we have
      
      where tilde means charge conjugation. For Majorana neutrinos, both
particle - antiparticle conjugation and charge conjugation leave the field
unchanged because it does not have any charges
There may be, however, some differences in the phase factors,
see ..
As we have already pointed
out, particle - antiparticle and charge conjugations are not equivalent
when acting on chiral fields.
    
    
      For  fermion species (flavours), the Majorana mass term can be written as
      
      where  is a vector in the flavour space and
 is a  matrix. Using the anticommutation property of the
fermion fields and eq. (), it is easy to show that the matrix
 must be symmetric: . It is interesting to note that
in classical field theory it would be antisymmetric, .
This, in particular, means that in the case of just one neutrino species
the Majorana mass vanishes identically in classical field theory. It is,
therefore, an essentially quantum quantity.
Kinematically, Dirac and Majorana masses are indistinguishable: they lead
to the same relation between energy, momentum and mass of the particle,
.
    
    
      From eq. () a very important difference between the Dirac and
Majorana mass terms follows. The Dirac mass terms  are
invariant with respect to the  transformations
      
      i.e. they conserve the corresponding charges (electric charge, lepton or
baryon number, etc.). It follows from () that the Majorana mass
terms break all the charges
that the field  has by two units. This, in particular,
means that, since the electric charge is exactly conserved, no charged
particle can have Majorana mass. Therefore, out of all known fermions,
only neutrinos can be Majorana particles. If neutrinos have Majorana
masses, the total lepton number is not conserved, while it is conserved if
neutrinos are Dirac particles.

    Neutrino masses in the standard model and slightly beyond

    
      In the standard model of electroweak interactions, all quarks and charged
fermions get their masses through the Yukawa couplings with the Higgs
field :
      
      where  and  are left handed quark and lepton doublets,
,  and  are  - singlet right-handed fields
of up-type quarks, down-type quarks and charged leptons respectively,
,  being the isospin Pauli matrices,
and  are the generation indices.
After the electroweak symmetry is broken by a nonzero vacuum expectation
value (VEV)  of the Higgs field, the Yukawa terms in () yield
the mass matrices of quarks and charged leptons
      
    
    
      Neutrinos are massless in the minimal standard model. They cannot have Dirac
masses because there are no  - singlet (&#8220;sterile&#8221;) right-handed
neutrinos  in the standard model. Can neutrinos have Majorana
masses? The answer is no. The reason for this is rather subtle, and it is
worth discussing it in some detail.
    
    
      The Majorana mass term should be of the form  [see
eq. ()]. Since  has the weak isospin projection ,
the Majorana mass term has , i.e. it is a component of the
isotriplet operator .
Therefore, in order to introduce the Majorana mass in a gauge invariant way
so as not to spoil the renormalizability of the standard model, one would
need an isotriplet Higgs field :
      
      Problem 3. Show that for any SU(2) spinor , 
has the same transformation properties as , and in particular
that both  and  are invariants
while  and  transform as vectors. Hint: use the property
 of the
Pauli matrices. 
    
    
      When the electrically neutral component of 
develops a VEV, Majorana neutrino mass is
generated. However, such a Higgs does not exist in the standard model.
Can one construct a composite triplet Higgs operator out of two Higgs
doublets? Yes, the operator , i.e. has the correct quantum numbers. However, the term
 has the dimension , i.e. it cannot enter in the Lagrangian
of a renormalizable model at the fundamental level. Can the operator
      
      be generated as an effective operator at some higher loop level? If so, it
would produce the Majorana mass term for neutrinos 
when the Higgs field develops a nonvanishing VEV, with  being the
characteristic mass scale of the particles in
the loop. In principle, this is possible. However, in the standard model this
does not happen because the total lepton number  (more precisely, the
difference of the baryon and lepton numbers ) is exactly conserved.
    
    
      Let us discuss this point in more detail. In the standard model, lepton
and baryon numbers are conserved at the perturbative level due to
accidental symmetries of the Lagrangian.
These symmetries are called accidental because they are not imposed on the
Lagrangian but are just the consequence of the particle content of the
standard model, its gauge invariance, renormalizability and Lorentz
invariance. Indeed, consider, for example, the lepton number violating
operators  where for simplicity the isospin structure has been suppressed.
Such operators have isotriplet and isosinglet components: , both of them with hypercharge . Thus, we need
a hypercharge 2 field (or product of the fields) to obtain a gauge
invariant expression. One can, e.g., try  which is
the gauge invariant  operator. However it is a product of three
fermion fields and therefore is neither Lorentz invariant nor renormalizable.
The lepton number violating () operator in eq. () is
both gauge and Lorentz invariant, but, as we have already mentioned, it is a
 nonrenormalizable operator. One can construct, e.g., a baryon number
and lepton number violating () gauge and Lorentz
invariant operator
      
      where  are the  indices; however it is a 
nonrenormalizable operator. Similarly, one can consider all other possible
- and -violating operators that can be constructed with the
standard-model fields and make sure that all of them either violate gauge
or Lorentz invariance, or are nonrenormalizable. Therefore  and  are
automatic symmetries of the standard model at the perturbative level.
    
    
      Nonperturbatively, both  and  are violated by the electroweak sphalerons
since these symmetries are anomalous. This violation is tiny and of no
practical consequences at low energy and temperatures but may be very
important, e.g., in the early universe . The triangle anomalies
of the baryon and lepton number currents are equal to each other in the
standard model, so that  is anomaly free and therefore conserved exactly.
Since the operators of the type () which could produce Majorana
mass terms for neutrinos break not only  but also  by two units, they
cannot be induced in the standard model even nonperturbatively. Thus,
neutrinos are exactly massless in the minimal standard model.
    
    
      It is interesting to note that if the lepton number (or ) conservation
was not exact, neutrino Majorana mass term could be generated even in the
standard model framework. It has been speculated that quantum gravity
should respect only gauge symmetries while violating all the global
symmetries, such as baryon or lepton numbers. If so, it could induce the
operators of the type () in the standard model with the mass
scale  of the order of the Planck mass  GeV . This would give neutrino Majorana masses
 eV, which is exactly of the right
order of magnitude to account for the solar neutrino deficiency through
the vacuum neutrino oscillations.
    
    
      How can we extend the standard model so as to accommodate nonzero neutrino
mass? One can either extend the Higgs content of the model, or the fermion
content, or both, or enlarge the gauge group (which also requires extended
particle content). One possibility would be to introduce the isotriplet
Higgs field  discussed above. However, such a
theory would not be very attractive. The VEV  of the triplet Higgs would
modify the masses of the  and  bosons at the tree level, and in order
not to run into a contradiction with the experimental value of the parameter
 it should be  a few GeV. The Yukawa
coupling () conserves the lepton number provided that one assigns
the lepton charge  to the isotriplet Higgs. If the Higgs potential is
also -conserving, the VEV  would break the lepton number spontaneously
and therefore would give rise to the corresponding massless neutral Goldstone
boson  which is called &#8220;triplet Majoron&#8221;  (in fact, due to
the electroweak symmetry breaking, the Majoron is a linear combination of
the isodublet and isotriplet fields with the dominant triplet contribution).
In this case even more stringent constraint on the VEV of the triplet
Higgs results from astrophysics,  keV. Such small a value of
 means that the massive counterpart of the Majoron, , should be
very light and can be produced in the decays . Such a decay
would add to the invisible width of the  boson a quantity which is
equal to the width of decay into two extra neutrino species, in sharp
contradiction with eq. (). Therefore the triplet Majoron model
is ruled out now. If one allows the -breaking terms in the Higgs
potential (e.g., , lepton number would be broken
explicitly and no Majoron appears. However, in the standard model, it is
highly unnatural to have the triplet Higgs VEV  &#8211; there is no
symmetry or dynamical mechanism to protect it, and its expected value is
, which would lead to a grossly wrong value of the  parameter.
    
    
      It is interesting to note that isotriplet Higgs fields may be quite natural
in the framework of extended gauge theories. For example, the Higgs content
of the most popular version of the left-right symmetric theories 
based on the gauge group  includes a
bi-doublet , which gives the usual Dirac masses  of fermions, and
the fields  and 
which are triplets of  and  respectively. Their VEVs
 and  produce the Majorana mass terms for the left-handed and
right-handed neutrinos,  and . The VEV  determines the
mass scale at which parity is spontaneously broken, and is expected to be
very large, thereby explaining non-observation of the right-handed ()
interactions at low energies. Right handed neutrinos are also very heavy
in this model, while the masses of  are naturally very small due to
the seesaw mechanism :  (we shall discuss
this mechanism in detail in sec. ). The minimization of
the Higgs potential leads to , i.e. the smallness of
 is a natural consequence of the largeness of , and a kind of the
seesaw mechanism for the Higgs VEVs operates.
    
    
      Another possible extension of the standard model is just to add three
 singlet neutrinos , one per fermion generation. In a sense,
this is natural since it restores the quark-lepton symmetry: in the
minimal standard model all left handed (isodoublet) quarks and charged
leptons have right handed (isosinglet) counterparts, while neutrinos do not
This argument, however, has to be taken with some caution: the
existence of the right handed counterparts of charged left handed fermions
is dictated by the requirement of the electroweak anomaly cancellation
whereas this argument does not apply to right handed neutrinos,
see
below..
    
    
      Right handed neutrinos can have the usual Yukawa couplings to lepton
doublets. Since they have zero isospin and are electrically neutral, their
hypercharge is also zero, i.e. they
are electroweak singlets. Therefore they can have &#8220;bare&#8221; Majorana
mass terms which are invariant with respect to .
The part of the Lagrangian that is relevant for the lepton mass generation
is therefore
      
      The second term here yields the Dirac neutrino mass matrix . If one assigns the lepton charge  to all the 
fields, the first two terms on the r.h.s. of eq. () conserve
the total lepton number  [although not the individual lepton numbers,
or lepton &#8220;flavours&#8221;  ()]. However, the third term
breaks  by two units. Alternatively, if one assigns zero lepton charge
to , the third term in () conserves , but then the
second term breaks it. Therefore the introduction of  in the
standard model leads to a qualitatively new situation: lepton number is no
longer an automatic symmetry of the Lagrangian following from gauge and
Lorentz invariance and renormalizability.
    
    
      Since  are electroweak singlets, they do not contribute to the
electroweak anomaly, and their number is not fixed by the requirement of the
anomaly cancellation. In particular, their number need not coincide with the
number of generations : it may as well be smaller or even larger than
. There are, however, astrophysical and cosmological constraints on
their number that depend on their masses and mixing parameters
.
    
    
      Problem 4. Assuming that there are two right-handed neutrinos per
fermion generation and that the Majorana mass terms are absent, write down
the most general neutrino mass term and analyze it. What would be the
neutrino mass spectrum in this case? What would happen if there were instead
two right-handed charged leptons per fermion generation?

    General Dirac + Majorana case

    
      We shall consider now the most general neutrino mass term for the case of
 species of left handed and right handed neutrinos. It includes not only
the Dirac mass  and Majorana mass  for  but also the
Majorana mass  for left handed neutrinos.
The neutrino mass term can be written as
      
      Here  is the vector of 
left handed fields (which we have written here as a line rather than column
to save space),  and  are complex symmetric 
matrices,  is a complex  matrix, and we have introduced the
Dirac and right handed Majorana mass matrices through their complex
conjugates for simplicity of the further notation. The matrix  has
the form
      
      and in deriving eq. () we have used the relations
      
      Problem 5. Prove these relations using properties () and
() of the matrix .
    
    
      It is instructive to consider first the simple one-generation case in
which ,  and  are just numbers, and  is a
 matrix.
For simplicity we shall
assume all the mass parameters to be real.
The matrix  can be
diagonalized by the transformation
 where  is an orthogonal matrix and
.
We introduce the fields  through , or
      
      Here  and  are the left handed components of
neutrino mass eigenstates.
The mixing angle  is given by
      
      and the neutrino mass eigenvalues are
      
      They are real but can be of either sign. The mass term can now be rewritten
as
      
      Here we have defined
      
      with  or  for  or  respectively. It follows
immediately from eq.&#160;() that the mass eigenstates  and
 are Majorana neutrinos. The relative signs of the mass
eigenvalues ( and ) determine the relative CP parities of
 and ; physical masses  and  are positive, as
they should.
The fact that the mass eigenstates in the case of the most general Dirac +
Majorana mass term are Majorana particles should not be surprising. We
have four neutrino degrees of freedom, ,  and their -
conjugates  and . The mass
matrix has two different eigenvalues, so there are two massive neutrino
fields. Each of them corresponds to two degrees of freedom, therefore they
have to be Majorana particles. Analogously, in the case of  generations,
the most general mass term () leads to  massive Majorana
neutrinos.
    
    
      It is instructive to consider some limiting cases. In the limit of no
Majorana masses (), pure Dirac case has to be recovered.
In this case the mass matrix () has the form
      
      This matrix corresponds to a conserved lepton number  which can be identified with the
total lepton number . Thus, the lepton number is conserved in this
limiting case, as expected. Let us now check that the usual Dirac mass
term is recovered.
    
    
      The matrix  in () is diagonalized by the rotation
() with , and its eigenvalues are  and .
This means that we have two Majorana neutrinos that have the same mass,
opposite CP parities and are maximally mixed. We now want to demonstrate
that this is equivalent to having one Dirac neutrino of mass . We have
; from eqs.&#160;() and () it then follows
, . This gives
      
      where
      
      The counting of the degrees of freedom also shows that we must have a Dirac
neutrino in this case &#8211; there are four degrees of freedom and just one
physical mass.
Thus, two maximally mixed degenerate Majorana neutrinos of opposite CP
parities merge to form a Dirac neutrino. It is easy to see that in this case
their contributions into the probability amplitude of the neutrinoless double
beta decay  (which is only possible for Majorana neutrinos)
exactly cancel, see eq. () in sec. .
    
    
      If the Majorana mass parameters  and  do not vanish but are
small compared to , the resulting pair of Majorana neutrinos will
be quasi-degenerate with almost maximal mixing and opposite CP parities.
The physical neutrino masses in this case are . Such a pair in many respects behaves as a Dirac neutrino and
therefore sometimes is called a &#8220;quasi-Dirac neutrino&#8221;. In particular,
its contribution to the  decay amplitude () is
proportional to the mass difference  which is much smaller than
the mass of each component.
    
  </section><section title="Seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation&#10;">
    
    Seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation

    
      The natural mass scale in the standard model is the electroweak scale
which is of the order of
 GeV. The smallness of, e.g., the electron mass 
MeV is not explained; however, it is easily accommodated in the standard
model through the proper choice of the corresponding Yukawa coupling,
. At the same time, similar explanation of the
smallness of the electron neutrino mass,  eV, would
require the Yukawa coupling . Does this
pose any problem? If we are willing to accept a very small Yukawa coupling
of the electron, why should not we accept small neutrino Yukawa couplings
as well? After all,  may be as good (or as bad) as .
    
    
      The problem is that, except for neutrinos, the masses of all the fermions
in each of the three generations are within 1 - 2 orders of magnitude
of each other. The inclusion of neutrinos leads to huge disparities of
the fermion masses within each generation. Therefore, if a future
more complete theory explains why there is a large mass hierarchy between
generations, it would still remain to be explained why neutrinos are so
light compared to the other fermions of the same generation.
    
    
      The seesaw mechanism  provides a very simple and
attractive explanation of the smallness of neutrino mass. It relates
the smallness of  with the existence of very large mass scales. Although
the seesaw mechanism is most natural in the framework of the grand unified
theories (such as ) or left-right symmetric models, it also
operates in the standard model extended to include the right handed
(&#8220;sterile&#8221;) neutrinos . This is the model
discussed in the end of sec. , and the relevant part of the
Lagrangian is given by eq.&#160;(). We shall now consider the seesaw
mechanism
in some detail.
    
    
      The most general mass term for  generations of left handed and right
handed neutrinos is written in eq. () with the mass matrix given
in eq. ().
Notice that in the standard model there is no Majorana mass term for
left handed neutrinos since there are no triplet Higgs scalars; however,
 is different from zero in some extensions of the standard model,
so we shall keep it for generality.
The right handed neutrino  is an electroweak singlet and so its
mass is not protected by the electroweak symmetry. One can therefore
expect it to be very large, possibly at the Planck scale or at some
intermediate scale  GeV
which may be relevant for the physics of parity breaking.
    
    
      Let us first consider the limit  of the simple
one-generation case discussed in the previous section. In this limit
      
      
      Thus we have a very light Majorana mass eigenstate  predominantly
composed of  and a heavy eigenstate  mainly composed of
. The admixture of the singlet neutrino state  in 
and that of the usual neutrinos  in  are of the order of
. As follows from eq. (), it is
 being heavy that makes  light
This is the commonly used jargon: in fact,  and ,
being chiral fields, do not have any mass but rather are components of some
massive fields. It would be more correct to say that the fact that 
made predominantly of  and its -conjugate  is
heavy explains the lightness of  made predominantly of  and
, but this is just too lengthy..
    
    
      Consider now the full -generation case. We want to block-diagonalize
the matrix  in eq. () so as to decouple light and heavy
neutrino degrees of freedom:
      
      where  is a unitary  matrix, and we have changed the
notation . We shall be looking for the matrix  of the
form
      
      where the elements are  matrices, and  will be treated as
a perturbation.
We shall neglect for simplicity possible CP violation in the leptonic sector
and take ,  and  to be real matrices (effects of CP violation
in neutrino oscillations will be discussed in sec. ). The matrix
 can then also be chosen to be real. Block-diagonalization of
 gives
      
      These relations generalize those of eq. () to the case of 
generations. The diagonalization of the effective mass matrix 
yields  light Majorana neutrinos which are predominantly composed of
the usual (&#8220;active&#8221;) neutrinos  with very small ()
admixture of &#8220;sterile&#8221; neutrinos ; diagonalization of 
produces  heavy Majorana neutrinos which are mainly composed of .
It is important that the active neutrinos get Majorana masses 
even if they have no &#8220;direct&#8221; masses, i.e. , as it is in the standard
model. The masses of active neutrinos are then of the order of .
Generation of the effective Majorana mass of light neutrinos is
diagrammatically illustrated in fig. .
It is interesting that with the largest Dirac mass eigenvalue of the order
of the electroweak scale,  GeV, the right handed scale
 GeV which is close
to the typical GUT scales, and assuming that the direct mass term , one obtains the mass of the heaviest of the light neutrinos
 eV, which is just of the right order of
magnitude for the neutrino oscillation solution of the atmospheric neutrino
anomaly.
    
    
    
      Problem 6. Perform the approximate block diagonalization of the matrix
 and verify eq.&#160;().
    
    
      As was pointed out before, in general the number  of &#8220;sterile&#8221; neutrino
species need not coincide with the number  of the &#8220;active&#8221; ones. The
seesaw mechanism works
when  as well, and the
formulas of eqs. () - () are still valid. The
difference is that now the matrices  and  are rectangular
 matrices ( lines,  columns) rather than square matrices.
The matrices  and  are square matrices of dimension 
and  respectively; the same is true for the unit matrices in the
left upper and right lower corners of the matrix  in ().
    
    
      In deriving eq. () we have assumed that the matrix  can be
considered as a small parameter, i.e. that . In what sense one
can consider one matrix to be much larger than another? Does that mean
that we have to require that all the elements of  be much larger
than all the elements of ? Obviously, this is not correct. One can,
for example, consider the matrix  in the basis of  in
which  has been diagonalized; in this case all off-diagonal elements
of  are zero and yet the seesaw approximation works perfectly well.
On the contrary, if one chooses the matrix  with all its elements
equal to each other, the standard seesaw mechanism fails, no matter how
large the elements of . This is just because  in this case,
so that the matrix  does not exist. The true criterion of the
applicability of the seesaw approximation is that all eigenvalues of 
be large compared to all eigenvalues of .
    
    
      Problem 7. Consider the seesaw mechanism for three  and
three  species in the case when one of the eigenvalues of  is
zero. What will be the neutrino mass spectrum in this case? Hint: go to
the  basis where  is diagonal and include the line and the
column that contain zero eigenvalue into a redefined matrix . 
    
  </section><section title="Neutrino oscillations in vacuum&#10;">
    
    Neutrino oscillations in vacuum

    
      Neutrino oscillations are the most sensitive probe of neutrino mass. Solar
and supernova neutrino experiments may be able to discover the neutrino mass
as small as  eV or even smaller, far beyond the reach of the direct
kinematic search experiments. The idea of neutrino oscillations was first
introduced by Pontecorvo . The essence of this effect is
very simple, and examples of the oscillation phenomena can be found in
nearly every textbook on quantum mechanics. Consider, for example, a
two-level quantum system. If the system is in one of its stationary states
 (eigenstates of the Hamiltonian), it will remain in this
state, and the time evolution of the wave function is very simple &#8211; it just
picks up a phase factor: .
If, however, a state is prepared which is not one of the eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian of the system, the probability to find the system in
this state will oscillate in time with the frequency 
where  and  are the eigenenergies of the system.
    
    
      In the case of neutrino oscillations, neutrinos are produced by the
charged-current weak interactions and therefore are weak-eigenstate neutrinos
,  or . However, the neutrino mass matrix in this
(flavour) basis is in general not diagonal. This means that the mass
eigenstate neutrinos ,  and  (the states that diagonalize
the neutrino mass matrix, i.e. the free propagation eigenstates) are in
general different from the flavour eigenstates. Therefore the probability of
finding a neutrino created in a given flavour state to be in the same state
(or any other flavour state) oscillates with time.
    
    
      We shall consider neutrino oscillations in the case of Dirac neutrino mass
term and then will comment on the Majorana and Dirac + Majorana cases.
The part of the Lagrangian that describes the lepton masses and charged
current interactions is
      
      Here the primes are used to denote the flavour eigenstate fields. It follows
from this expression that the individual lepton flavours ,  and
 are not conserved when the Dirac neutrino mass term is present,
but the total lepton number  is still conserved.
    
    
      The mass matrix of charged leptons  and the neutrino mass matrix 
are general complex matrices which can be diagonalized by bi-unitary
transformations. Let us write
      
      and choose the unitary matrices
, ,  and  so that they diagonalize the mass matrices of
charged leptons and neutrinos:
      
      The &#8220;unprimed&#8221; fields , ,  and  are
then the components of the Dirac mass eigenstate fields 
and . The Lagrangian in eq. () can be
written in the mass eigenstate basis as
      
      where  are the charged lepton masses
and  are the neutrino masses. The matrix  is
called the lepton mixing matrix, or Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) matrix
. It is the leptonic analog of the CKM mixing matrix. It relates a
neutrino flavour eigenstate  produced or absorbed alongside
with the corresponding charged lepton, to the mass eigenstates :
      
      In what follows, to simplify the notation we shall omit the primes and
distinguish between the flavour and mass eigenstates just by using the
indices from the beginning of the Latin alphabet for the former and from its
middle for the latter. Assume that at a time  the flavour eigenstate
 was produced. What is the probability to find the neutrino
in a state  at a later time ? Time evolution of the flavour
eigenstates is not simple, therefore it is more convenient to follow the
evolution of the system in the mass eigenstate basis (we shall discuss
evolution in the flavour basis in sec. ). The initial state at
 is ; the neutrino
state at a later time  is then
      
      The probability amplitude of finding the neutrino at the time  in a
flavour state  is
      
      As usual, the sum over all intermediate states  is implied. The last
expression here has a very simple physical meaning. The factor  is the amplitude of transformation of the initial flavour
eigenstate neutrino  into a mass eigenstate one ; the factor
 is just the propagator describing the time evolution of the
mass eigenstate neutrino  in the energy representation, and finally
the factor  converts the time-evolved mass eigenstate 
into the flavour eigenstate . The neutrino oscillation probability,
i.e. the probability of the transformation of a flavour eigenstate neutrino
 into another one , is then
      
    
    
      We have discussed neutrino oscillations in the case of Dirac neutrinos.
What happens if neutrinos have a Majorana mass term rather than the Dirac
one? Eq. () now has to be modified: the term  has to be replaced by  This mass term breaks not only the individual lepton flavours but
also the total lepton number.
The symmetric Majorana mass matrix  is diagonalized by
the transformation , so one can again use the
field transformations (). Therefore the structure of the charged
current interactions is the same as in the case of the Dirac neutrinos, and
the diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix in the case of the  fermion
generations again gives  mass eigenstates. Thus the oscillation
probabilities in the case of the Majorana mass term are the same as in the
case of the Dirac mass term. This, in particular, means that one cannot
distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos by studying neutrino
oscillations. Essentially, this is because the total lepton number is not
violated by the neutrino flavour oscillations.
    
    
      The situation is different in the case when the neutrino mass term is of the
most general Dirac + Majorana (D + M) form (which, like in the pure Dirac
case, requires the existence of the electroweak singlet neutrinos ).
In particular, in the case of   and   species, the
neutrino mass matrix has the dimension , leading to 
massive Majorana neutrino states. The total lepton number conservation is
violated by the Majorana mass term. Unlike in the pure Dirac and pure
Majorana cases, in this D + M case one can have a new type of neutrino
oscillations: in addition to the usual flavour oscillations , oscillations into &#8220;sterile&#8221; states, , can occur.
These oscillations violate the total lepton number . Thus, the D + M case
can in principle be distinguished from the pure Dirac and Majorana cases
in neutrino oscillations experiments. For more detailed discussion of the
D + M case see, e.g., .
    
    
      
      2 flavour case

      
        Let us now consider neutrino oscillations in a simple case of just two
neutrino species,  and . The lepton mixing matrix  can
be written as
        
        where
, ,  being the mixing angle.
The neutrino mass and flavour eigenstates are therefore related through
        
        Substituting () into () and taking into account that for
relativistic neutrinos of the momentum ,
        
        we find the transition probabilities
        
        Here .
The survival probabilities are .
It is convenient to rewrite the transition probability in terms of the
distance  travelled by neutrinos.
For relativistic neutrinos , and one has
        
        where  is the oscillation length defined as
        
        It is equal to the distance between any two closest minima or maxima of
the transition probability (see fig. ).
Notice that  is inversely proportional to
the energy difference of the neutrino mass eigenstates: . Another convenient form of the expression for the
transition probability is
        
        where  is in  and  in MeV or  is in  and  in GeV.
      
      
      
        Let us discuss the probability of neutrino oscillations () (see
fig. ). It has two factors. The first one ()
does not depend on the distance travelled by neutrinos;
it describes the amplitude (or depth) of the neutrino oscillations. The
amplitude is maximal (equal to one) when the mixing angle ,
which corresponds
to maximal mixing. When  is close to zero or , flavour
eigenstates are nearly aligned with mass eigenstates, which corresponds to
small mixing. In this case the oscillation amplitude is small. The second
factor oscillates with time or distance  travelled by neutrinos. The
phase of the sine (the oscillation phase) is proportional to the energy
difference of the mass eigenstates  and to the distance .
In order to have an appreciable transition probability, it is not enough to
have large mixing: in addition, the oscillation phase should be not too small.
When the oscillation phase is very large, the transition probability
undergoes fast oscillations. Averaging over small energy intervals
corresponding to the finite energy resolution of the detector, or over small
variations of the distance between the neutrino production and detection
points corresponding to the finite sizes of the neutrino source and
detector, results then in averaging out the neutrino oscillations. The
observed transition probability in this case is
        
      
      
        In our discussion we have been assuming that the initially produced neutrino
state has a certain momentum. Since it is a mixture of different mass
eigenstates, its energy is not well defined in this case. We then consider
the time evolution of the neutrino state. Alternatively, one could assume that
the neutrino is produced in a state of a certain energy but not well defined
momentum, and consider the evolution of the neutrino system in space. For
relativistic neutrinos the result will be the same. Which description is more
correct? Does the initially produced state have a certain energy or a certain
momentum? In general, since the production process takes finite time and is
localized in space, neither neutrino energy nor momentum is well defined;
moreover, the transition probability depends on both the neutrino production
and detection processes. Fortunately, for relativistic neutrinos these
subtleties are unimportant, and the simple description in terms of the states
with certain momentum or energy gives the correct answer
Uncertainties of neutrino energy and momentum may be important for
the question of coherence of the neutrino state in the case of the
oscillations over very long baselines , e.g. for oscillations
of solar or supernova neutrinos on their way to the earth. For
discussion see, e.g., ..
      
    
    
      
      3 flavour case

      
        Consider now the case of three neutrino flavours. The neutrino flavour
eigenstate and mass eigenstate fields are related through
        
        In general, in the case of Dirac neutrinos the lepton mixing matrix  in
() depends on three mixing angles ,  and
 and one CP-violating phase  (in the case of Majorana
neutrinos there are two additional, so-called Majorana phases, see discussions
in sections  and ). It is convenient to use the
parametrization of the matrix  which coincides with the standard
parametrization of the quark mixing matrix :
        
        Here , . The probabilities of oscillations between various
flavour states are given by the general expression (). Unlike in
the two-flavour case, they in general do not have a simple form. There are,
however, several practically important limiting cases in which one can obtain
very simple approximate expressions for the oscillation probabilities in terms
of the 2-flavour ones. Assume first that the neutrino mass squared differences
 have a hierarchy
        
        This means that either  (direct hierarchy)
or  (inverted mass hierarchy). These cases are of
practical interest since the solar neutrino data indicate that one needs a
small mass squared difference  eV for the
solution of the solar neutrino problem through the matter-enhanced neutrino
oscillations (or  eV for the vacuum
oscillations solution) whereas the explanation of the atmospheric neutrino
experiments through the neutrino oscillations requires  eV, much larger than .
Consider first the oscillations over the baselines  for which
        
        This case is relevant for atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino
experiments. It follows from () that the oscillations due to the
small mass difference  are effectively frozen in this case,
and one can consider the limit .
The probability of  oscillations then takes a very simple
form:
        
        It resembles the 2-flavour oscillation probability. The probabilities
of oscillations between ,  and  are
        
        with .
They depend only on the elements of the third
column of the lepton mixing matrix  and one mass squared difference.
The survival probability for electron neutrinos takes a particularly
simple form
        
        i.e. it coincides with the  survival probability in the 2-flavour
case with the mass squared difference  and
mixing angle .
      
      
        Consider now another limiting case, which is relevant for the solar neutrino
oscillations and also for very long baseline reactor experiments (such as
KamLAND, see sec. ). We shall be again assuming the hierarchy
() and in addition
        
        whereas the condition () is no longer necessary.
In this case the oscillations due to the mass squared differences
 and  are very fast and lead to an averaged
effect; the  survival probability is then
        
        where  is the  survival probability in the 2-flavour
case with the mass squared difference  and
mixing angle . In the case of neutrino oscillations
in vacuum one has
        
        Finally, consider the limit  (the results will be also approximately
valid for ). In this case one obtains
        
        where , and no assumption about the
hierarchy of the mass squared differences has been made. Notice that the
limiting cases that we have discussed here are not mutually excluding,
i.e. have some overlap with each other.
      
      
        In general, when considering the propagation of solar neutrinos in the sun
or in the earth, one should take into account matter effects on neutrino
oscillations. The same is true for the terrestrial atmospheric and long
baseline accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments in which the neutrino
trajectories or their significant portions go through the matter of the
earth. Matter effects on  oscillations are
relatively small (they vanish in the 2-flavour approximation), but they may
be quite appreciable for  and  oscillations. We shall discuss these effects in
sec. . As we shall see,
eq. () remains valid in the case of neutrino
oscillations in matter as well, but the two-flavour probability ()
has to be modified. Eqs. () - (), () and
() - () are also modified in the case of neutrino
oscillations in matter (see sec. ).

      Implications of CP, T and CPT symmetries

      
        We shall now consider the consequences of CP, T and CPT symmetries for
neutrino oscillations. As we discussed in sec. , charge conjugation
operation C is not well defined for neutrinos as it would convert a left
handed neutrino into a non-existent left handed antineutrino. CP, however,
is well defined: it converts a left handed neutrino  into a right
handed antineutrino which is the antiparticle of . Thus, CP
essentially acts as the particle - antiparticle conjugation. If CP is
conserved, the probabilities of oscillations between particles and their
antiparticles coincide:
        
        In quantum field theory, the same field operator that
annihilates a particle also creates its antiparticle, whereas its Hermitean
conjugate does the opposite. Therefore the action of the particle &#8211;
antiparticle conjugation on the lepton mixing matrix  amounts to
. This means that CP is only conserved in the leptonic sector if
the mixing matrix  is real or can be made real by a rephasing of the lepton
fields.
      
      
        In general, a unitary  matrix depends on  angles
and  phases. In the Dirac case,  phases can be removed by
a proper rephasing of the left handed fields, leaving
 physical phases (the rephasing of the left
handed field leaves the lepton mass terms unchanged since the phases can be
absorbed into the corresponding rephasing of the right-handed fields).
Thus, in the Dirac case CP non-conservation is only possible in the case of
 generations. In the Majorana case there is less freedom to rephase
the fields since the Majorana mass terms are of the form 
rather than of the form  and so the phases of
neutrino fields cannot be absorbed.
Therefore in the Majorana case only  phases can be removed, leaving
 physical phases. Out of these phases,  are
the usual, Dirac-type phases while the remaining  are specific for the
Majorana case, so called Majorana phases. Majorana phases do not lead to any
observable effects for neutrino oscillations , and we shall
not consider them here.
      
      
        CPT transformation can be considered as a combined action of CP, which
results in the interchange between paricles and antiparticles, and time
reversal, which interchanges the initial and final states. Therefore under
CPT transformation the oscillation probability  goes
into . One the other hand, from
eq. () it follows that the CPT transformation ,  transforms the oscillation amplitude  into its
complex conjugate. Therefore the oscillation probabilities are invariant with
respect to CPT, i.e. the following equality holds:
        
        CPT invariance implies, in particular, that the survival probabilities for
neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same: .
      
      
        Finally, time reversal T interchanges the initial and final states, so if
T is conserved one has
        
        From CPT invariance it follows that CP conservation is equivalent to T
conservation; indeed, it is easy to see that () and
() lead to ().
      
      
        Let us now consider effects of CP-violation on neutrino oscillations.
If CP is not conserved, the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos are
different from those for antineutrinos. As we pointed out before, this is
only possible if the lepton mixing matrix  is essentially complex, i.e.
has unremovable phases. For three lepton generations, there is only one such
phase , and so there should be only one CP-odd oscillation asymmetry.
Let us denote the CP-odd asymmetries as
        
        From CPT invariance one finds . Using the
parametrization () of the mixing matrix  it is not difficult
to find
        
      
      
        Problem 13. Derive eq. () using parametrization
() and unitarity property of the lepton mixing matrix .
      
      
        This expression has several interesting features. First, as expected, it
vanishes in the limit . Second, it vanishes if any of the mixing
angles ,  or  is zero or .
In particular, oscillation probabilities ()-()
obtained in the limit  are CP-symmetric. Third, since the
mass squared differences satisfy the
relation , the CP-odd
asymmetry () vanishes if even one of 
is zero. We have already encountered this situation &#8211; the transition
probabilities () - ().
derived in the limit  depend only on the absolute values
of  and are therefore CP-invariant.
The relation between  also means that in the
limit of the small arguments of the sines (small oscillation phases) in
eq. () the probability asymmetry is cubic (more precisely,
tri-linear) in small phases rather than linear. Another important difference
between the usual oscillation probabilities and the CP-odd asymmetry
() is that while the former contain squared sines of the
oscillation phases and therefore oscillate near non-zero average values,
the latter is linear in these sines and so oscillates around zero. This means
that in the case of very large oscillation phases, when the averaging
regime sets in, the CP-odd asymmetry of neutrino oscillations averages to
zero. It is for this reason that the oscillation probability ()
is CP-invariant.
      
      
        It follows from the above discussion that the experimental observation of
CP violation effect in neutrino oscillations is a very difficult task. The
CP-odd probability asymmetry is suppressed if any one of the three lepton
mixing angles is small, and we know from the CHOOZ reactor neutrino experiment
that the mixing angle  is small (see sec.  below
for a discussion of the reactor and accelerator data). The atmospheric neutrino
experiments indicate that the mixing angle  is rather large, but
the value of  is largely unknown: the present solar neutrino
data allow both large and small values for this mixing angle. The hierarchy
() of the mass squared differences which follows from the solar
and atmospheric neutrino observations further hinders experimental searches
of CP violation in the neutrino oscillation experiments. In addition, matter
effects on neutrino oscillations may mimic CP violation and so make the
searches of the genuine CP violation even more difficult (see sec.
). Still, the presently allowed values of neutrino parameters
do not exclude a possibility of observation of CP violation effects in the
future neutrino experiments. Discovering CP-nonconservation in the leptonic
sector would be of great importance, so the goal is worth pursuing.
      
      
        Problem 14. Using CPT invariance and the unitarity condition
 (and similar
conditions for  and ) show that there is only one
independent CP-odd oscillation asymmetry in the case of three
neutrino flavours.
      
      
        Problem 15. Apply the same approach to the four-flavour case and find
the number of independent CP-odd oscillation asymmetries in that case.
Compare it with the number of the physical Dirac-type phases in the mixing
matrix  in the case of four generations.

    Neutrino oscillations in matter

    
      Neutrino oscillations in matter may differ from the oscillations in vacuum
in a very significant way. The most striking manifestation of the matter
effects on neutrino oscillations is the resonance enhancement of the
oscillation probability &#8211; the Mikheyev - Smirnov - Wolfenstein (MSW) effect
. In vacuum, the oscillation probability cannot exceed
, and for small mixing angles it is always small. Matter can
enhance neutrino mixing, and the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in
matter can be large (close to unity) even if the mixing angle in vacuum is
very small. Matter enhanced neutrino oscillations provide a very elegant
solution of the solar neutrino problem; matter effects on oscillations of
solar and atmospheric neutrinos inside the earth can be quite important.
Neutrino oscillations in supernovae and in the early universe may also be
strongly affected by matter.
    
    
      How does the matter affect neutrino propagation? Neutrinos can be absorbed
by the matter constituents, or scattered off them, changing their momentum
and energy. However the probabilities of these processes, being proportional
to the square of the Fermi constant ,
are typically very small. Neutrinos can also experience forward
scattering, an elastic scattering in which their momentum is not changed.
This process is coherent, and it creates mean potentials  for neutrinos
which are proportional to the number densities of the scatterers. These
potentials are of the first order in , but one could still expect them
to be too small and of no practical interest. This expectation, however,
would be wrong. To assess the importance of matter effects on neutrino
oscillations, one has to compare the matter-induced potentials of neutrinos
 with the characteristic neutrino kinetic energy differences
. Although the potentials  are typically very small,
so are ; if  are comparable to or larger than
, matter can strongly affect neutrino oscillations.
    
    
      
      Evolution equation

      
        We shall now consider neutrino oscillations in matter in some detail.
Neutrinos of all three flavours &#8211; ,  and  &#8211;
interact with the electrons, protons and neutrons of matter through neutral
current (NC) interaction mediated by  bosons. Electron neutrinos in
addition have charged current (CC) interactions with the electrons of the
medium, which are mediated by the  exchange (see fig. ).
      
      
      
        Let us consider the CC interactions. At low neutrino energies, they
are described by the effective Hamiltonian
        
        where we have used the Fierz transformation. In order to obtain the coherent
forward scattering contribution to the energy of  in matter (i.e. the
matter-induced potential for ) we fix the variables corresponding to
 and integrate over all the variables that correspond to the electron:
        
        Furthermore, we have
        
        where  is the electron number density. For
unpolarized medium of zero total momentum only the first term survives,
and we obtain
        
        Analogously, one can find the NC contributions  to the
matter-induced neutrino potentials. Since NC interaction are flavour
independent, these contributions are the same for neutrinos of all three
flavours. In an electrically neutral medium, the number densities of protons
and electrons coincide, and the corresponding contributions to 
cancel. The direct calculation of the contribution due to the NC scattering
of neutrinos off neutrons gives , where
 is the neutron number density. Together with eq.&#160;() this
gives
        
        For antineutrinos, one has to replace .
      
      
        Let us now consider the evolution of a system of oscillating neutrinos in
matter. In vacuum, the evolution is most easily followed in the mass
eigenstate basis. In matter it is more convenient to do that in the
flavour basis because the effective potentials of neutrinos are diagonal
in this basis. Consider first the two-flavour case. As usual, we write
 where  and  are two-component vectors
of neutrino fields in the flavour and mass eigenstate bases and the matrix 
is given by eq. (). In the absence of matter, the evolution equation
in the mass eigenstate basis is ,
where .
This gives the
evolution equation in the flavour basis:
.
For relativistic neutrinos , and we thus obtain
        
        Here  and  stand for time dependent amplitudes of
finding the electron and muon neutrino respectively. The expressions in
the brackets in the diagonal elements of the effective Hamiltonian in
eq. () coincide.
They can only modify the common phase of the neutrino states and therefore
have no effect on neutrino oscillations which depend on the phase differences.
For this reason one can omit these terms. The evolution equation describing
neutrino oscillations in vacuum in the flavour basis then takes the form
        
      
      
        We now proceed to derive the neutrino evolution equation in matter. To do
that, one has to add the matter-induced potentials  and  to the
diagonal elements of the effective Hamiltonian  in eq. ().
Notice that  and  contain a common term due to NC interactions.
As we already know, such common terms in the diagonal elements are of no
consequence for neutrino oscillations; we can therefore omit them
The NC contribution does, however, affect the oscillations between
the usual and &#8220;sterile&#8221; (electroweak singlet) neutrinos in matter..
This gives
        
        This is the evolution equation which describes 
oscillations in matter. The equation for 
oscillations has the same form.
In the two-flavour
approximation,  oscillations are not
modified in matter since ; however, in the full 3-flavour
framework matter does influence the 
oscillations because of the mixing with , see sec. .
      
    
    
      
      Constant density case

      
        Let us now consider the evolution equation (). In general, the
electron number density  depends on the coordinate along the
neutrino trajectory or, in our description in eq.&#160;(), on .
We shall first consider a simple case of constant matter density and
chemical composition, i.e. . Diagonalization of the effective
Hamiltonian in () gives the following neutrino eigenstates
in matter:
        
        where the mixing angle  is given by
        
        It is different from the vacuum mixing angle  and therefore the
matter eigenstates  and  do not coincide with mass
eigenstates  and .
The difference of neutrino eigenenergies in matter is
        
        It is now easy to find the probability of 
oscillations in matter:
        
        where
        
        It has exactly the same form as the probability of oscillations in vacuum
(), except that the vacuum mixing angle  and oscillation
length  are replaced by those in matter,  and .
In the limit of zero matter density , , and
the vacuum oscillation probability is recovered.
      
      
        The oscillation amplitude
        
        has a typical resonance form, with the maximum value 
achieved when the condition
        
        is satisfied. It is called the MSW resonance condition.
From () or () it follows that when () is
fulfilled, mixing in matter is maximal (), independently
from the vacuum mixing angle . Thus, the probability of neutrino
flavour transition in matter can be large even if the vacuum mixing angle is
very small!
      
      
        For the resonance enhancement of neutrino oscillations in matter to be
possible, the r.h.s. of () must be positive:
        
        i.e. if  is heavier than , one needs , and vice versa. It follows from eq. ()
that the condition () is equivalent to the requirement that of
the two mass eigenstates  and , the lower-mass one have a
larger  component. If one chooses the convention ,
(as is usually done) then () reduces to . The resonance condition for antineutrinos is then
. Therefore, for a given sign of , either
neutrinos or antineutrinos (but not both) can experience the resonantly
enhanced oscillations in matter.
      
    
    
      
      Adiabatic approximation

      
        Let us now discuss the realistic case of matter of varying density. Typically,
one deals with situations when a beam of non-monochromatic neutrinos (i.e.
neutrinos with some energy distribution) propagates in a medium with certain
density profile. If  is of the right order of magnitude, then for
any value of the matter density (or a significant portion of them) there is a
value of neutrino energy for which the resonance condition () is
satisfied.
Conversely, every value (or a significant portion of the values) of neutrino
energy 
&#8220;finds&#8221; a value of the matter density for which the resonance condition
() is satisfied. If the neutrino beam is monochromatic (as, e.g.,
in the case of the solar Be neutrinos),
the resonance enhancement of neutrino oscillations is still possible if the
corresponding resonance density is within the density range of the matter
in which neutrinos propagate. Thus, the MSW resonance condition does not
involve any fine tuning.
      
      
        In general, for oscillations in a matter of an arbitrary non-uniform density,
the evolution equation () does not allow an analytic solution and
has to be solved numerically. However, there is an important particular case
in which one can get an illuminating approximate analytic solution. This
is the case of slowly (adiabatically) varying matter density.
      
      
        We shall start with a semi-quantitative discussion. Consider electron
neutrinos born in a matter of a very high density, far above the MSW
resonance one (e.g., in the core of the sun). We shall assume that the matter
density is monotonically decreasing along the neutrino trajectory. From
eq. () it follows that the mixing angle in matter at the neutrino
production point , which means
that the neutrino mixing is strongly suppressed by matter. As neutrinos
propagate towards the regions of smaller density, their mixing increases
(mixing angle  decreases); it becomes maximal at the resonance point,
where . As neutrinos propagate further towards smaller
densities, their mixing angle continues decreasing; it reaches the value
 at densities , where 
is the resonance value of the electron number density given by
eq. ().
From eq.&#160;() it follows that at the production point,
where , the produced  almost coincide with
the matter eigenstate neutrinos . If the matter density changes
slowly enough (adiabatically) along the neutrino path, the neutrino system
has enough time to &#8220;adjust&#8221; itself to the changing external conditions.
In this case the transitions between the matter eigenstates  and
 are exponentially suppressed. This means that if the system was
initially in the eigenstate , it will remain in the same eigenstate.
However, the flavour composition of this eigenstate changes as neutrino
propagates in matter because the mixing angle  that determines this
composition is the function of matter density. Since at the final point of
neutrino evolution , eq. () tells us
that the matter eigenstate neutrino  at this point has the component
of originally produced  with the weight  and the
component of  with the weight , i.e. the
transition probability is
        
        This means that in the case of small vacuum mixing angle, one can have almost
complete adiabatic conversion of  to !
      
      
      
        This is illustrated by fig. 
which shows the energy levels of  and  along with those in
the absence of mixing (i.e. of  and ) as the function of
the electron number density. In the absence of mixing the energy levels cross
at the MSW resonance point, but with nonvanishing mixing the levels &#8220;repel&#8221;
each other, and the avoided level crossing results. If the probability of the
transition between the two matter eigenstates is small, neutrinos produced as
 at high densities and propagating towards smaller densities follow
the upper () branch and end up on the level that corresponds to
 at small . This resonance conversion is similar to the well
known Landau - Zener phenomenon in atomic and molecular physics.
      
      
        The expression () for the conversion probability
looks paradoxical: the smaller the vacuum mixing angle, the larger the
probability that the initially produced  will be converted into
 or vice versa. Does this mean that in the limit of vanishing
 one can still have strong neutrino conversion? The answer, of
course, is no. The reason is simple: if  becomes too small, the
adiabaticity of the conversion gets broken, and
eq. () ceases to be valid. Similar situation takes place in the
case of neutrino oscillations in a matter of constant density: if the MSW
resonance condition is satisfied, the oscillation amplitude , no matter how small ; however, in the limit 
the phase of the second  factor in eq. () vanishes, and
no oscillations occur.
      
      
        We shall now turn to a more quantitative description of the neutrino
conversion in the adiabatic regime, which will also allow us to establish
the domain of applicability of the adiabatic approximation. At any instant of
time, the effective Hamiltonian , which is given by the matrix on
the r.h.s. of eq. (), can be diagonalized by a unitary
transformation
        
        Here  is the vector of the instantaneous
matter eigenstates,  and  are instantaneous eigenvalues of
, and the matrix  has the form () except
that the vacuum mixing angle  has to be replaced by the mixing
angle  given by eq.&#160;() with . The
evolution equation in the basis of the instantaneous eigenstates can
therefore be written as , or
        
        where . Notice that the effective
Hamiltonian in this basis is not diagonal since the mixing angle 
is not constant, i.e. the matter eigenstate basis changes with time.
If the off-diagonal terms are small, i.e. ,
the transitions between the instantaneous eigenstates  and 
are suppressed. This corresponds to the adiabatic approximation. The
adiabaticity condition can be written as
        
        where  and  are given by eqs. () and ()
respectively. The parameter  is called the adiabaticity parameter.
In the adiabatic limit, the effective Hamiltonian in () is diagonal,
and time evolution of the matter eigenstates is very simple &#8211; they just
receive phase factors.
      
      
        Suppose that at a time  the electron neutrino was born:
        
        Then, in the adiabatic approximation, at a time  we have
        
        Taking into account that at  the mixing angle  is different from , one then finds
        
        where
        
        The second term in eq. () is a smooth function of , while
the third term oscillates with time. If the matter density at the neutrino
production point is far above the MSW resonance one, then  and the third term is strongly suppressed. In this case the
non-oscillatory neutrino conversion takes place, with the probability
. If, in addition, the final point of
neutrino evolution corresponds to a very low matter density,
 and eq. () is recovered. Notice that
eq. () is symmetric with respect to the interchange of the initial
and final evolution points .
      
      
        One can readily generalize this analysis to include possible transitions
between the matter eigenstates  and  due to the violation of
the adiabaticity. Let  be the probability that the  transitions have occured in the course of the evolution of the
neutrino system (&#8220;hopping probability&#8221;). Then
        
        where we have omitted oscillating terms which average to zero. In the case
of very small vacuum mixing angle and 
(or ), it reduces to a very simple
expression
        
        In the Landau-Zener approximation the hopping probability  can be
written as
        
        where  is the adiabaticity parameter
taken at the MSW resonance point. In the adiabatic limit, ,
one has  and eq. () is recovered. In the non-adiabatic
limit , , and the survival and transition
probabilities interchange; in that case the transition probability is small
when  is small. It should be noted that in the extreme non-adiabatic
limit eq. () for the hopping probability is not quite correct and
more accurate expressions should be used.
It is important that the transition probability can be quite sizable even
if the adiabaticity parameter is not very large: for  it
can be as large as about 80%, and one can, e.g., consider the condition
 (which can result in as large transition probabilities as
99%) as the adiabaticity criterion.
      
      
        Let us now discuss the adiabaticity condition () in more
detail. Since the difference of the eigenenergies reaches its minimum
equal to  at the MSW resonance (see eqs.
() and () and fig. ), the adiabaticity is
worst at the resonance. If the adiabaticity condition at the resonance is
satisfied, it will then also be satisfied away from it
Assuming that  does not have strong maxima
outside the resonance region..
The adiabaticity parameter at the MSW resonance is
        
        where  is the density scale height at the resonance, i.e. the
characteristic distance over which the electron number density varies
significantly in the resonance region.
      
      
        The adiabaticity condition has a simple physical meaning.
Let us define the resonance width at half height  as the spatial
width of the region where the amplitude of neutrino oscillations in matter
. It is easy to obtain
        
        From () we find that the oscillation length at the resonance is
.
Therefore the adiabaticity parameter at the resonance () can be
written as
        
        i.e. the adiabaticity condition  is just the condition that
at least one oscillation length fit into the resonance region.
      
      
        As follows from () and (), both the MSW resonance
condition and the adiabaticity parameter at the resonance  depend
on neutrino energy. Therefore the efficiency of the matter-enhanced neutrino
flavour conversion is energy dependent. This should have important
consequences, for example, for solar or supernova neutrinos, leading to
characteristic distortions of the energy spectra of detected neutrinos.
      
      
      
        For neutrino oscillations in a matter of density which decreases monotonically
along the neutrino path (e.g., for neutrino oscillations in the sun), the
average neutrino survival probability  is schematically
shown in fig. (). It has a typical &#8220;bathtub&#8221;
shape. In the case of small vacuum mixing angle, the low energy edge of the
curve corresponds to no suppression (resonance density exceeds the maximal
available matter density  &#8211; there is no MSW resonance). The
steep decrease of  corresponds to the value of  at which
the MSW resonance condition () is satisfied at .
The bottom of the suppression bathtub corresponds to the adiabatic regime,
whereas the slow increase of  at higher energies is due to the
loss of adiabaticity. The high energy edge of the suppression curve
corresponds to the non-adiabatic regime. In the case of larger vacuum
mixing angles, the suppression curve shows a similar behavior, but with
smaller amplitudes of changes of the survival probability  and a wider
adiabatic region.
      
      
        It should be noted that the fulfillment of the
adiabaticity condition () is not, in general, sufficient for
the strong flavour conversion to take place: in addition, one has to
require that the total width (column density)  of the matter traversed
by neutrinos be large enough. If matter density changes slowly along the
neutrino trajectory, the scale height  is large, and so the
adiabaticity parameter  and the resonance width 
given by eqs.&#160;() and () can formally be very
large, too; however, in reality the resonance width cannot
exceed the total width of the matter slab traversed by neutrinos. For the
transition probability to be appreciable, the column density  must
satisfy 
        
      
      
        Problem 16. Derive eq. (). 
      
      
        Problem 17. Derive eq. () for the MSW resonance width. 
      
      
        Problem 18. Assuming that
the  transitions occur (with probability )
in a narrow region around the MSW resonance and that the change of the
oscillation phases in that region is small, derive the non-adiabatic
analog of eq. (). Show that upon averaging of the oscillating
terms eq. () is obtained.
      
    
    
      
      3 flavour case

      
        The evolution equation describing neutrino oscillations in matter in the case
of three neutrino flavours ,  and  is
        
        Here  is the 3-flavour vacuum mixing matrix defined in eq. ()
or (), and  was defined in eq. (). In general, it
is rather difficult to study this equation analytically, even in the
adiabatic approximation. There are, however, several important particular
cases when the evolution of the 3-flavour neutrino system can be
approximately expressed through the 2-flavour amplitudes.
One such case is the case of the hierarchical mass squared differences
(). It is of particular interest because this is exactly the
type of the hierarchy which is suggested by the solar and atmospheric
neutrino experiments. We shall now discuss this case in some detail.
      
      
        The mixing matrix  in the three-flavour case can in general be written
as (see, e.g., )
        
        where
        
        and . The phase  in
 is the usual Dirac-type CP violating phase, whereas the phases
 and  are present only in the Majorana case. It
immediately follows from eq. () that the Majorana phases have no
effect on neutrino oscillations, and therefore one can omit the factor 
and write . In this case the matrix  defined in () coincides
with the one in ().
      
      
        We shall first consider the case () which is relevant for
atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino
experiments.
Subtracting the term  from all the diagonal elements of the matrix
 and neglecting 
compared to  we get . The new matrix  commutes with the
rotation matrix , so the evolution equation () can be
rewritten as , where  is the second matrix on the r.h.s. of
eq. (): . Since  commutes with ,
it is convenient to go into a new basis defined through . The evolution equation in this basis is
        
        i.e. the problem is reduced to a 2-flavour problem of oscillations between
 and .
These oscillations are governed by the large mass squared difference
 and mixing angle . The CP-violating phase
 is unobservable in the limit  and so we
have omitted it. It is convenient to
subtract the term  from all the diagonal
elements of the effective Hamiltonian in eq. (), so as to make
the Hamiltonian of the two-flavour system 
traceless. The two-flavour evolution equation then takes the form
        
        For an arbitrary initial
state  the solution at a time  can be written as
, where  is the evolution
matrix that corresponds to the effective Hamiltonian in eq. ().
The unitary  matrix  can be parametrized as
        
        where  are the Pauli matrices in the  space, and the real parameters  and  satisfy . The matrix  can be found for
any matter density profile using the standard techniques developed for the
2-flavour neutrino oscillations. In particular, for long-baseline accelerator
experiments, neutrino path goes through the mantle of the earth where to
a very good approximation the matter density can be considered to be constant.
In this case the parameters  and  can be trivially found. For the
atmospheric neutrino oscillations, in the case of neutrinos traversing both
the mantle and the core of the earth, simple analytic expressions for the
parameters  and  can be obtained in the step-function
approximation to the density profile of the earth . With known 
and  it is easy to calculate the probabilities of neutrino
oscillations:

        In the limiting case () which is relevant for the solar neutrino
oscillations, and assuming, as before, the hierarchy (), one
finds that the  survival probability is again given by

probability  in this expression is no longer given by eq. ();
it has to be calculated from the 2-flavour evolution equation in matter

Find explicit formulas for the case of the oscillations in a matter of
constant density. Show that in the limit of vanishing density
eqs. ()-() are recovered.
      
      
        As we have already discussed, matter affects neutrino and antineutrino
oscillations differently: for  and , it can
enhance oscillations of neutrinos but always suppresses oscillations of
antineutrinos, whereas in the case  the situation is opposite.
This means that even in the absence of the CP-violating
phase  in the mixing matrix (), the probabilities of
neutrino oscillations are different from those of antineutrino oscillations,
i.e. matter induces the CP violating effects. This is because the usual matter
is itself CP (and also C and CPT) asymmetric since it consists of particles
and not of antiparticles, or in general not of equal number of particles
and antiparticles. This CP violation is, however, &#8220;macroscopic&#8221; rather
than microscopic; although it may be useful for experimental searches of
matter effects on neutrino oscillations, it does not say anything about the
CP violation in the leptonic sector at the fundamental level.
Thus, matter effects can mimic the true CP violation and therefore may
make it difficult to disentangle the genuine CP violation from the macroscopic
one in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .
      
      
        There is, however, a circumstance that may in principle facilitate
experimental searches of the genuine CP violation in the leptonic sector. In
vacuum, CP-odd and T-odd asymmetries of the neutrino oscillation probabilities
coincide; they both depend on the same CP- and T-violating parameter .
For neutrino oscillations in a medium, CP is violated by the matter but T
in general is not: it is only violated if the matter density profile is
T-asymmetric, i.e. asymmetric with respect to the interchange of the
positions of the neutrino source and detector. A matter with T-symmetric
density profile (and in particular, a matter of constant density) does not
induce any T violation, and an experimental observation of a T violating
asymmetry  in such a matter would
directly measure the fundamental T (and CP) violating phase .
      
      
        Matter effects on propagating neutrinos are not limited to the MSW effect
discussed in this section. Matter can also modify significantly neutrino
decays in the case of unstable neutrinos , and neutrino spin and
spin-flavour precession in magnetic fields . In particular, the
spin-flavour precession (simultaneous change of neutrino chirality and flavour
due to interaction of neutrino flavour-off-diagonal magnetic moments with
magnetic fields) can be resonantly enhanced in matter; this phenomenon
is similar to the MSW effect.
Neutrino oscillations in matter can also be amplified even if the neutrino
mixing angles both in vacuum and in matter are small, i.e. if there
is no MSW effect (no level crossing). This is possible if the change of matter
density along the neutrino path and the change of the oscillation phase are
&#8220;synchronized&#8221; in a certain way . In this case the
oscillation probability can be strongly enhanced due to a cumulative build-up
effect . This phenomenon is of the same nature as the
parametric resonance in mechanical or electromagnetic oscillations.
It has been discovered recently that this parametric enhancement of neutrino
oscillations can lead to observable effects in the oscillations of atmospheric
 and solar  neutrinos in the earth.
      
    
  </section><section title="Double beta decay">
    
    Double beta decay
    
      In some cases when the ordinary beta decay processes () are
energetically forbidden, the double beta decay processes, in which a
nucleus  is converted into an isobar with the electric charge
differing by two units, may be allowed:
      
      In such decays two neutrons of the nucleus are simultaneously converted into
two protons, or vice versa. At the fundamental (quark) level, these are
transitions of two  quarks into two  quarks or vice versa (see
fig. a). Double beta decays are processes of the second order
in weak interactions, and the corresponding decay rates are very low: typical
lifetimes of the nuclei with respect to the  decay are  years. The processes () are called
 decays. Two-neutrino double beta decays with the emission of
two electrons () were experimentally observed for a
number of isotopes with the half-lives in the range 
years; there are very few candidate nuclei for  decay, and the
experimental observation of this process is difficult because of the very
small energy release ( values).
    
    
      If the lepton number is not conserved, the electron neutrino or antineutrino
emitted in one of the elementary beta decay processes forming the 
decay can be absorbed in another (fig. b), leading to the
neutrinoless double beta decay ():
      
      Such processes would have a very clear experimental
signature: since the recoil energy of a daughter nucleus is negligibly small,
the sum of the energies of the two electrons or positrons in the final state
should be equal to the total energy release, i.e. should be represented by
a discrete energy line. Therefore  decays could serve as a
sensitive probe of the lepton number violation. In some extended models
exotic modes of  decay are possible, e.g. decays with Majoron
emission. In this case the sum of the energies of two electrons or
positrons is not a discrete line, but their spectrum is expected to be
different from that with no Majoron emission .
    
    
    
      Neutrinoless  decays break not only the lepton number; since the
absorbed  or  has a &#8220;wrong&#8221; chirality, 
decays also break chirality conservation (this is another example of the
chiral prohibition rule). Therefore  decay is only possible
if neutrinos have nonzero Majorana mass. Indeed, if  decay is
mediated by the standard weak interactions, the amplitude of the process
is proportional to neutrino mass (fig. b):
      
      Notice that this expression contains  rather than .
If CP is conserved in the leptonic sector, the mixing matrix 
can always be made real; however in this case the mass parameters 
in () (eigenvalues of the neutrino mass matrix) can be of either
sign, their relative signs being related to the relative CP parities of
neutrinos. This means that in general significant cancellations between
various contributions to the sum in () are possible. As we discussed
in sec. , a pair of Majorana neutrinos with equal physical
masses , opposite CP parities and maximal mixing is equivalent to
a Dirac neutrino. It is easy to see that such a pair does not contribute
to the amplitude in (). Analogously, the contribution of a
quasi-Dirac neutrino is strongly suppressed.
    
    
      Naively, one could expect that the rates of  decays to be
much higher than those of  decays because the final state in
 decays contains fewer particles than
that of  decays. In reality the situation is more complicated &#8211;
the rates of  decay are strongly suppressed by a very small
factor , where  ( a
few MeV) is the typical energy release in  decay. Neutrinoless
double beta decay was searched for experimentally but up to now
have not been discovered. The experiments allowed to put the upper bound on
the effective Majorana neutrino mass, the best limit coming from the
Heidelberg &#8211; Moscow experiment on  decay of Ge
:
      
      depending on the value of the nuclear matrix element which is not
precisely known. If the  decay is discovered, it will be
possible to infer the value of the effective Majorana neutrino mass
. As follows from (), this would
give the lower limit on the mass of the heaviest neutrino.
    
    
      In extended gauge models such as the left right symmetric (LR) or SUSY
models, additional mechanisms of  decay are possible. For the
LR models a typical diagram is shown in fig. c. It appears
that no Majorana mass  of  is necessary in this
case, i.e.  decay can occur even if . This, however, is
incorrect: in all extended models in which  decay occurs,
the Majorana masses of  are different from zero. In particular, in
the LR models in which the diagram c exists, the seesaw
mechanism operates and so . It can be shown in a model-independent
way that  decay always means  .

    The solar neutrino problem

    
      It is generally believed that the stellar energy is provided by thermonuclear
reactions. For so called main sequence stars (to which our sun belongs),
the main result of these reactions is a fusion of hydrogen into
helium:
      
      The main reaction chain in which the fusion process ()
occurs in the sun is the  cycle (fig. ), whereas the
carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is responsible for less than 2% of
solar energy.
Neutrinos are emitted in six reactions of the solar  cycle
(Table ).
They are produced in nuclear beta decay or electron capture reactions, and
their energy spectra are well known (see fig. ). Three of these
reactions &#8211;  and the electron capture into two different final states
of Be &#8211; produce monochromatic  lines, whereas the neutrinos born
in the other three reactions have continuous energy spectra. The fluxes of
the solar  are calculated in the framework of the standard solar
models. These models are based on the assumptions of local hydrostatic
equilibrium, thermonuclear nature of solar energy, energy transfer in the sun
by radiation and convection and the requirement that the present values of the
solar radius, mass, luminosity and He/H ratio be reproduced as a result of
the solar evolution. There are about 20 different solar models developed
during the last decade by more than ten different groups of authors, all
based on the above mentioned principles. All these models except one agree
with each other well (see fig. ).
A number of recent models also took into account diffusion of helium
and heavy elements.
These models were able to reproduce with a very high accuracy the solar
sound velocities inferred from the helioseismological measurements .
This gives further credibility to the standard solar models.
    
    
    
    
      The calculated fluxes of different components of the solar  flux
depend not only on the general principles laid in the basis of the standard
solar models, but also on a number of input parameters, such as the solar
opacity and various nuclear cross sections. These parameters are known to a
varying degree of accuracy . The flux of the most abundant 
neutrinos is closely related to the well known luminosity of the sun, and
therefore has a very small uncertainty, . On the other hand, the
flux of the energetic B neutrinos has a relatively large uncertainty,
. The flux of the most energetic  neutrinos is the least
certain one &#8211; it is only known to an accuracy of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude.
Fortunately, this flux is very small, and its contribution to the
detection rates of solar neutrinos is practically negligible. It can,
however, affect the high energy part of the solar neutrino spectrum.
    
    
      The solar neutrinos have been detected in five solar neutrino experiments.
Historically, the first one was the Homestake
experiment of Davis and his collaborators. It is based on the reaction
      
      The radioactive argon atoms produced in this reaction are extracted using
chemical methods and counted in proportional counters.
The energy threshold of reaction () is 0.814 MeV, so only
the B and Be and  neutrinos are detected in the Homestake
experiment, the largest contribution coming from the B neutrinos (see
figs.  and ). Radiochemical techniques are also
used in two other solar neutrino experiments &#8211; SAGE and Gallex, in which
the reaction
      
      is employed. The energy threshold of this reaction is 0.234 MeV, and so
the gallium experiments can also detect the lowest energy  neutrinos.
Since the flux of the  neutrinos is very large, they are expected to
give the main contribution to the event rates in the SAGE and Gallex
detectors (fig. ). The remaining two experiments &#8211;
Kamiokande and its up-scaled version Super-Kamiokande &#8211; are the water
Cherenkov detectors and use the neutrino-electron scattering reaction
      
      to detect solar neutrinos.
This reaction has zero physical threshold, but one has to introduce energy
cuts to suppress the background. In the Kamiokande experiment solar
neutrinos with the energies  MeV were detected, whereas the
threshold used by Super-Kamiokande is at present 5.5 MeV.
With these energy cuts, the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande detection rates
are only sensitive to the B component of the solar neutrino flux.
Reaction () has a very interesting feature &#8211; for neutrino
energies  the angular distribution of the recoil electrons
is forward-peaked, i.e. it points in the direction of the momentum of the
incoming neutrino. The angular distributions of neutrinos detected in the
Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments have a prominent peak at
 from the direction to the sun, which is a beautiful proof of
the solar origin of these neutrinos. The origin of the neutrinos
detected in the radiochemical experiments is unknown, and our belief that
they come from the sun is based on the fact that no other sources of
sufficient strength and energy are known.
    
    
    
      In all five solar neutrino experiments, fewer neutrinos than expected
were detected, the degree of deficiency being different in the experiments
of different types (fig. ). This is the essence of the
solar neutrino problem. The observed deficiency of solar neutrinos could be
due to an insufficient knowledge of solar physics or an error in some input
parameters (astrophysical solution), or due to experiment-related errors
(such as miscalculated detection efficiency or cross section), or due to
some unknown neutrino physics (particle physics solution of the solar
neutrino problem). As we have already discussed, the standard solar models
are well grounded, agree with each other and with helioseismological
observations.
All the solar neutrino experiments but one (Homestake) have been calibrated,
and their experimental responses
were found to be in a very good agreement with expectations. The argon
extraction efficiency of the Homestake detector was also checked by doping it
with a known small number of radioactive argon atoms, but no calibration
has been carried out since no artificial source of neutrinos with a suitable
energy spectrum exists.
    
    
      The solar neutrino problem is not just the problem of the deficit of the
observed neutrino flux: results of different experiments seem
to be inconsistent with each other.
In the absence of new neutrino physics, the energy spectra of the various
components of the solar neutrino flux are given by the standard nuclear
physics and well known, and only the total fluxes of these components may
be different from those predicted by the standard solar models. One can
then infer the flux of B neutrinos directly from the Kamiokande or
Super-Kamiokande data, and use this flux to find the corresponding
contribution to the Homestake detection rate. This contribution turns out to
be larger than the total detection rate, so the best-fit contribution of the
Be neutrinos to the Homestake detection rate is negative!
In fact, if one assumes that the solar neutrino spectra are undistorted, one
can demonstrate the existence of the solar neutrino problem without using
any information about solar physics except the solar luminosity constraint,
or even without this constraint, i.e. in a solar-model independent way.
Therefore the probability of the astrophysical solution of the solar
neutrino problem is very low.
    
    
      Alternatively, one could assume that the observed deficit of solar neutrinos
is due to some unknown experimental errors. However, in this case it is not
sufficient to assume that one of the solar neutrino experiments is wrong;
one would have to assume that the experiments of at least two
different types (chlorine, gallium and water Cherenkov) are wrong, which is
very unlikely. The remaining possibility is that the spectra of solar
neutrinos are distorted, which requires new neutrino physics.
    
    
      There are several possible particle-physics solutions of the solar neutrino
problem, the most natural one being neutrino oscillations (for an alternative
solution related to nonzero neutrino magnetic moments, see e.g. ).
The neutrino oscillation solution has become even more plausible after the
strong evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations was reported by the
Super-Kamiokande Collaboration. Neutrino oscillations can convert a fraction
of solar  into  or  (or their combination).
Since the energy of solar neutrinos is smaller than the masses of muons
and tauons, these  or  cannot be detected in the CC
reactions of the type () or () and therefore are invisible
in the chlorine and gallium experiments. They can scatter on electrons
through the NC interactions and therefore should contribute to the
detection rate in water Cherenkov detectors. However, the cross section of
the NC channel of reaction () is about a factor of 6 smaller
than that of the CC channel, and so the deficit of the neutrino flux
observed in the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments can be
explained. The probabilities of neutrino oscillations depend on neutrino
energy, and the distortion of the energy spectra of the experimentally
detected solar neutrinos, which is necessary to reconcile the data of
different experiments, is readily obtained.
    
    
    
      The oscillations of solar neutrinos inside the sun can be strongly enhanced
due to the MSW effect which we discussed in sec. , and the
solar data can be fitted even with a very small vacuum mixing angle. Solar
matter can also influence neutrino oscillations if the vacuum mixing
angle is not small. The allowed values of the neutrino oscillation parameters
 and  which fit the detection rates in the
chlorine, gallium and water Cherenkov experiments in the 2-flavour scheme are
shown in fig.  for matter enhanced (left panel) and vacuum (right
panel) oscillations of  into active neutrinos. In the case of the
matter enhanced oscillations, there are three allowed ranges of the
parameters corresponding to the small mixing angle (SMA), large mixing angle
(LMA) and low  (LOW) MSW solutions . The LOW
solution has a very low probability and only exists at 99% c.l.. The vacuum
oscillation (VO) solution corresponds to very small values of ,
for which the neutrino oscillation length () for typical solar
neutrino energies ( a few MeV) is comparable to the distance between
the sun and the earth. This solution is also known as &#8220;just so&#8221;
oscillation solution. For  oscillations, there is
only the SMA solution with the allowed region of parameters similar to
that for oscillations into active neutrinos.
    
    
      Solar neutrinos detected during night travel some distance inside the
earth on their way to the detector, and their oscillations can be affected
by the matter of the earth. In particular, a fraction of  or
 produced as a result of the solar  oscillations can
be reconverted into  by oscillations enhanced by the matter of the
earth. This earth &#8220;regeneration&#8221; (or day/night) effect can be appreciable
in the case of the LMA solution, but is expected to be very small in the
case of the SMA solution. The day/night effects (and in general, the
zenith angle dependence of the neutrino signal) can in principle be
observed in real-time experiments, such as Super-Kamiokande.
    
    
      In the case of the MSW solutions of the solar neutrino problem the
neutrino state arriving at the earth is an incoherent superposition of the
mass eigenstates  and  (see Problem 23 below). The
probability  of finding a solar  after it traverses the
earth depends on the average  survival probability in the
sun :
      
      Here  is the probability of oscillations of the
second mass eigenstate into electron neutrino inside the earth.
It follows from this expression that the sign of the night-day asymmetry
 depends on whether  is larger or smaller than 1/2.
For the LMA solution, , and the night-day
asymmetry is expected to be positive.
For the SMA solution,  for the Super-Kamiokande experiment is close
to 1/2, and therefore the expected day/night effect is small. It can in
principle be of either sign. The value measured in the Super-Kamiokande
experiment is

      
      i.e. shows an excess of the night-time flux at about 2. The zenith
angle event dependence measured by the Super-Kamiokande shows a rather flat
distribution of the excess of events over different night-time zenith angle
bins. This is rather typical for the LMA solution whereas for the SMA
solution one normally expects the excess (or deficiency) to be concentrated
in the vertical upward bin with zenith angles  in the range
. Thus, the night-time zenith angle dependence and
the overall night-day asymmetry () favour the LMA solution of the
solar neutrino problem.
    
    
      As we discussed before, oscillations of solar neutrinos in the 3-flavour
scheme can be described through the effective two-flavour  survival
probability (see eq. () and Problem 20). For a recent detailed
analysis of the solar neutrino oscillations in the 3-flavour framework,
see .
    
    
      Problem 22. Discuss effects of the solar and earth&#8217;s matter on the
oscillations of solar neutrinos in the case of VO solution. Take into account
that the matter densities  and  vary in the
ranges 0 &#8211; 150 and 2.7 &#8211; 12.5  respectively.
    
    
      Problem 23. Show that in the case of the MSW solutions the
solar neutrino flux arriving at the earth can be considered as an
incoherent superposition of the neutrino mass eigenstates  and
. Hint: consider the relative phase between  and
 states acquired by neutrinos on their way from the sun to the
earth. Assume that the energy resolution of the neutrino detector
 keV.

    
    
      Problem 24. Derive equation () for the probability of
finding a solar  after it crosses the earth during night. Hint:
use the results of the previous problem.
    
    
    
      As we have already discussed, neutrino oscillations (both in matter and in
vacuum) depend on neutrino energy and therefore should result in certain
distortions of the spectrum of the detected solar neutrinos. One can obtain
an information on the spectrum of incoming neutrinos by measuring the recoil
electron spectrum in the reaction (). This spectrum has been
measured in the Super-Kamiokande experiment, and the results (along
with the typical predictions of the LMA, SMA and VO solutions) are shown
in fig. (). In the absence of the neutrino spectrum
distortion, the ratio of measured/expected electron spectrum presented in
this figure should be a horizontal line. The characteristic feature of
the measured spectrum is an excess of events in the region of high
energies. The experimental errors are still too large to allow a clean
discrimination between different solutions of the solar neutrino problem;
however, the spectrum favours VO over the other solutions. Another possible
explanation of the excess of the high energy events is that the flux
of the highest-energy  neutrinos has been underestimated by about a
factor of 20. Since the  flux is very poorly known, this is still a
possibility.
    
    
      At present, the situation with the solar neutrino data is somewhat
confusing: different pieces of the data favour different solutions of the
solar neutrino problem. The total rates are better fitted within the SMA
solution, the night/day ratio prefers the LMA solution, and the electron
recoil spectrum in Super-Kamiokande favours the VO solution. Clearly,
more data are needed to clear the situation up. Fortunately, two new
experiments which can potentially
resolve the problem are now under way or will soon be put into operation.
The SNO (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) experiment has started taking data,
and its first results are expected some time during 2000. The Borexino
experiment is scheduled to start data taking in 2001.
    
    
      The SNO detector consists of 1000 tons of heavy water, and it detects
solar neutrinos in three different channels:
      
      and  scattering process () which can proceed through both
CC and NC channels. The CC reaction () is very well suited for
measuring the solar neutrino spectrum. Unlike in the case of 
scattering () in which the energy of incoming neutrino is shared
between two light particles in the final state, the final state of the
reaction () contains only one light particle &#8211; electron, and a
heavy  system whose kinetic energy is very small. Therefore by measuring
the electron energy one can directly measure the spectrum of
the solar neutrinos. Detecting the solar neutrino spectrum would be
of great importance since any deviation from the spectrum predicted by
the nuclear beta decay would be a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; signature of new
neutrino physics.
    
    
      The cross section of the NC reaction () is the same for neutrinos
of all three flavours, and therefore oscillations between  and
 or  would not change the NC detection rate in the SNO
experiment. On the other hand, these oscillations would deplete the solar
 flux, reducing the CC event rate. Therefore the CC/NC ratio is
a sensitive probe of neutrino flavour oscillations. If solar 
oscillate into electroweak singlet (sterile) neutrinos, both CC and NC
event rates will be suppressed.
    
    
      The Borexino experiment will detect solar neutrinos through the 
scattering with a very low energy threshold, and will be able to detect
the Be neutrino line. Different solutions of the solar neutrino problem
predict different degree of suppression of Be neutrinos, and their
detection could help discriminate between these solutions.
Observation of the Be neutrino line would be especially important
in the case of the VO solution. Due to the eccentricity of the earth&#8217;s
orbit the distance between the sun and the earth varies by about 3.5%
during the year, and this should lead to varying oscillation phase (and
therefore varying solar neutrino signal) in the case of vacuum neutrino
oscillations. This seasonal variation can in principle be separated from
the trivial 7% variation due to the  law which is not related to
neutrino oscillations. However, the oscillation phase depends on neutrino
energy [see ()], and integration over significant energy
intervals may make it difficult to observe the seasonal variations of the
solar neutrino flux due to the VO. The Be neutrinos are monochromatic,
which should facilitate the observation of the seasonal variations. The
oscillation phase in () depends on the ratio , therefore
for neutrinos with continuous spectrum VO should lead to seasonal variations
of the spectrum distortion which are correlated with the seasonal variations
of the flux . Such variations would be a clear signature of the
VO solution.
    
    
      Although up to now the sensitivities of the solar neutrino experiments
have been insufficient to allow a clear-cut discrimination between different
solutions of the solar neutrino problem, one can hope that the combined data
of the currently operating and forthcoming experiments will allow to finally
resolve the solar neutrino problem.

    Atmospheric neutrinos

    
      Atmospheric neutrinos
are electron and muon neutrinos and their antineutrinos which are produced
in the hadronic showers induced by primary cosmic rays in the earth&#8217;s
atmosphere.
The main mechanism of production of the atmospheric neutrinos is given
by the following chain of reactions:
      
      Atmospheric neutrinos can be observed directly in large mass underground
detectors predominantly by means of their CC interactions:
      
      Naively, from the reaction chain () one would expect to have
two atmospheric muon neutrinos or antineutrinos for every electron neutrino
or antineutrino. In reality, the situation is more complicated: one should
take into account the differences in the lifetimes of , 
and  as well as the differences in their spectra. Also, although
the reaction chain () is the dominant source of atmospheric
neutrinos, it is not the only one. Calculations of the atmospheric
neutrino fluxes predict the  ratio that depends on neutrino
energy and the zenith angle of neutrino trajectory, approaching 2 for low
energy neutrinos and horizontal trajectories but exceeding this value for
higher energy neutrinos and for trajectories close to vertical.
    
    
      Accurate calculation of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes
is a difficult job which includes such ingredients as spectra and chemical
composition of cosmic rays (including geomagnetic effects and solar
activity), cross sections of  and  production off the nuclear
targets, Monte Carlo simulation of hadronic cascades in the atmosphere and
the calculation of neutrino spectra including muon polarization effects.
Each step introduces some uncertainty in the calculation.
The overall uncertainty of the calculated atmospheric neutrino fluxes is
rather large, and the total fluxes calculated by different authors differ
by as much as 20 &#8211; 30%. At the same time, the ratio of the muon to
electron neutrino fluxes is fairly insensitive to the above uncertainties,
and different calculations
yield the ratios of muon-like to electron-like contained events which
agree to about 5%.
This ratio has been measured in a number of experiments, and the Kamiokande
and IMB Collaborations reported smaller than expected ratio in their
contained events, with the double ratio  where MC stands for Monte Carlo simulations. The discrepancy
between the observed and predicted atmospheric neutrino fluxes was called
the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. The existence of this anomaly was
subsequently confirmed by Soudan 2, MACRO and Super-Kamiokande experiments.
Most remarkably, the Super-Kamiokande (SK) Collaboration obtained a very
convincing evidence for the up-down asymmetry and zenith-angle dependent
deficiency of the flux of muon neutrinos, which has been interpreted as an
evidence for neutrino oscillations. We shall now discuss the SK data and
their interpretation.
    
    
      The SK detector is a 50 kt water Cherenkov detector (22.5 kt fiducial
volume) which is overseen by more than 13,000 photomultiplier tubes. The
charged leptons born in the CC interactions of neutrinos produce the rings
of the Cherenkov light in the detector which are observed by the phototubes.
Muons can be distinguished from electrons since their Cherenkov rings
are sharp whereas those produced by electrons are diffuse.
The SK Collaboration subdivided their atmospheric neutrino events into several
groups, depending on the energy of the charged leptons produced.
Fully contained (FC) events are those for which the neutrino
interaction vertex is located inside the detector and all final state
particles do not get out of it. FC events are further subdivided into sub-GeV
(visible energy  GeV) and multi-GeV (visible energy  GeV)
events. Partially contained (PC) events are those for which the produced muon
exits the inner detector volume (only muons are penetrating enough). The
average energy of a neutrino producing a PC event in SK is  GeV.
Muon neutrinos can also be detected indirectly by observing the muons that
they have produced in the material surrounding the detector. To reduce the
background from atmospheric muons, only upward&#8211;going neutrino-induced muons
are usually considered. A rough estimate of the energy spectrum of the
upward&#8211;going muons has been obtained dividing them in two categories,
passing (or through-going) and stopping muons. The latter, which stop inside
the detector, correspond to the average parent neutrino energy 
GeV, whereas for the through-going muons the average neutrino energy is
 GeV.
    
    
      The measurements of the double ratio  for contained events at SK
(848 live days) give

      
      The value of  for sub-GeV events is different from unity (to which it
should be equal in no-oscillation case) by .
    
    
    
      We shall now discuss the zenith angle distributions of the atmospheric
neutrino events. It should be remembered that the zenith angle distributions
of the charged leptons which are experimentally measured do not coincide with
those of their parent neutrinos: for multi-GeV neutrinos the average angle
between the momenta of neutrinos and charged leptons is about ,
whereas for sub-GeV neutrinos it is close to . This is properly
taken into account in MC simulations. For PC events and upward going muons
the correlation between the directions of momenta of muons and parent
neutrinos is much better. The distances  traveled
by neutrinos before they reach the detector vary in a wide range: for
vertically downward going neutrinos (neutrino zenith angle )
 km; for horizontal neutrino trajectories ()
 km; the vertically up-going neutrinos ()
cross the earth along its diameter and for them  km.
    
    
      In fig.  the zenith angle distributions of the SK e-like and
-like events are shown separately for sub-GeV and multi-GeV contained
events. The data correspond to 736 live days. (By the time these lecture
notes were being written, the results for 848 live days of data taking had
been reported, but no high-quality figures for zenith angle distributions
were publicly available).
One can see that for e-like events, the measured zenith angle distributions
agree very well with the MC predictions (shown by bars), both in the
sub-GeV and multi-GeV samples, while for -like events both samples
show zenith-angle dependent deficiency of event numbers compared to
expectations. The deficit of muon neutrinos is stronger for upward going
neutrinos which have larger pathlengths. In the multi-GeV sample, there is
practically no deficit of events caused by muon neutrinos coming from the
upper hemisphere
(), whereas in the sub-GeV sample, all -like events
exhibit a deficit which decreases with . This pattern is
perfectly consistent with oscillations 
or  where  is a sterile neutrino.
Muon neutrinos responsible for
the multi-GeV sample are depleted by the oscillations when their pathlength
is large enough; the depletion becomes less pronounced as the pathlength
decreases ( increases); for neutrinos coming from the upper
hemisphere, the pathlengths are too short and there are practically no
oscillations. Neutrinos responsible for the sub-GeV -like events have
smaller energies, and so their oscillation lengths are smaller; therefore even
neutrinos coming from the upper hemisphere experience sizeable depletion
due to the oscillations. For up-going sub-GeV neutrinos the oscillation
length is much smaller than the pathlength and they experience averaged
oscillations. The solid line in fig.  obtained with the  oscillation parameters in the 2-flavour scheme
 eV,  gives an
excellent fit of the data.
    
    
    
      An informative parameter characterizing the distortion of the zenith angle
distribution is the up-down asymmetry , where up corresponds to the events
with  and down to those with .
The flux of atmospheric neutrinos is expected to
be nearly up-down symmetric for neutrino energies  GeV, with
minor deviations coming from geomagnetic effects
which are well understood and can be accurately taken into account.
In particular, at the geographical location of the SK detector
small positive asymmetry is expected.
Any significant deviation of the up-down asymmetry of neutrino induced
events from the asymmetry due to the geomagnetic effects
is an indication of neutrino oscillations or some other new neutrino
physics. The asymmetry measured for the SK multi-GeV -like events is

      
      i.e. is negative and differs from zero by almost !
The dependence of the asymmetries
for e-like FC and -like FC+PC events on the event momentum is shown
in fig.  (left panel). One can see that for e-like events
 for all momenta. At the same time, for -like events the
asymmetry is close to zero at low momenta and decreases with momentum.
This is easily understood in terms of the  oscillations. For very
small momenta, the oscillation length is small and both up-going and
down-going neutrino fluxes are depleted by oscillations to about the same
extent; in addition, loose correlation between the directions of the momenta
of the charged lepton and of its patent neutrino tends to smear out the
asymmetry at low energies.
With increasing momentum the oscillation length increases, and the
pathlength of down-going neutrinos becomes too small for oscillations to
develop. The right panel of fig.  gives the allowed values of the
oscillation parameters following from the SK FC and PC event data.
The best fit corresponds to  eV,
 and has a very good .
In this analysis the poorly known overall normalization
factor of the neutrino flux was considered as a free parameter, and the best
fit was achieved with 5% upward renormalization of the flux of Honda et al.
.
The above value of  should be compared with that of the no-oscillation
hypothesis: , which is a very poor fit.
    
    
    
      The SK data show evidence for neutrino oscillations not only in their
FC and PC -like events: upward stopping and upward through-going
events also demonstrate zenith angle dependent deficiency of muon
neutrinos consistent with neutrino oscillations, although the statistics
for up-going muons is lower than that for contained events. Fig. 
(left panel) summarizes the allowed region for 2-flavour neutrino oscillations
obtained from the combined analysis of the SK FC and PC single ring events
(848 live days), upward through-going (923 live days) and upward stopping
events (902 live days). The best fit () was obtained
for  eV,  and the
upward 6% renormalization of the flux of Honda et al. The no-oscillation
fit gives . The right panel gives the comparison of
the allowed regions obtained in different atmospheric neutrino experiments.
The evidence for neutrino oscillations is very impressive.
    
    
      Are neutrino oscillations that are responsible for the depletion of the
 flux  or ? For contained events, the oscillation probabilities in these two
channels are nearly the same and the data can be fitted equally well in
both cases, with very similar allowed ranges of the oscillation parameters.
However, for higher energy upward going events there are important
differences between these two cases.
In the 2-flavour scheme,  oscillations are
not affected by matter because the interactions of  and 
with matter are identical. However, sterile neutrinos do not interact with
matter at all, and therefore the  oscillations
are affected by the matter-induced potential . At low
energies, the kinetic energy difference  dominates over
, and the earth&#8217;s matter effects are unimportant. They become important
at higher energies, when ; at very high energies, when
, matter strongly suppresses neutrino oscillations
both in  and  channels (see eq. () where  has to be replaced
by  for these oscillation channels). Therefore the oscillations
of high energy neutrinos travelling significant distances in the earth
should be strongly suppressed in this case.
    
    
    
      Fig.  (upper left panel) shows the zenith angle distribution of
the upward through-going events ( GeV) along
with the predictions of  and
 scenarios with parameters obtained from the
fits of contained events. It can be seen that the  oscillation channel describes the &#8220;vertical&#8221; ()
events better than the  channel. For horizontal
and nearly horizontal events () both scenarios give similar
predictions since the neutrinos do not travel inside the earth or travel only
small distances there. This is further illustrated by the left bottom panel
of fig.  in which the Vertical/Horizontal event ratio is plotted.
The excluded ranges of the oscillation parameters for various oscillation
channels are shown in the right panel of fig. . One can conclude
that the  oscillations are currently disfavoured
at the  level, although not yet completely ruled out as a possible
solution of the atmospheric neutrino problem.
    
    
      Another way to discriminate between  and
 as the two possible main channels of the
atmospheric neutrino oscillations is through the detection of single
pions produced in the NC reactions . Sterile neutrinos
do not participate in these reactions and therefore  oscillations would deplete the number of the observed &#8217;s.
Unfortunately, cross sections of these NC reactions are only known with
large uncertainties,
and at the moment a clear discrimination between the  and  oscillations of atmospheric
neutrinos through the detection of single neutral pions does not seem to
be possible. The situation may change in the near future, however, as the
K2K Collaboration is planning to perform high statistics measurements
of neutrino interactions in their near detector.
    
    
      Can  oscillations be responsible for the
observed anomalies in the atmospheric neutrino data?
The answer is no, at least not as the dominant channel. Explaining the data
requires oscillations with large mixing equal or close to the maximal one;
 oscillations would then certainly lead to
a significant distortion of the zenith angle distributions of the e-like
contained events, contrary to observations. In addition, for  in
the range  eV which is required by the atmospheric
neutrino data,  oscillations are severely
restricted by the CHOOZ reactor antineutrino experiment, which excludes
these oscillations as the main channel of the atmospheric neutrino
oscillations (see sec. ).
    
    
      However, 
and 
can be present as
subdominant channels of the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos.
This may lead to interesting matter effects on oscillations of neutrinos
crossing the earth on their way to the detector.
Matter can strongly affect  and
 oscillations leading to
an enhancement of the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos and
suppression for antineutrinos or vice versa, depending on the sign of
the corresponding mass squared difference. For certain neutrino energies,
one can expect an enhancement due to the MSW effect in the mantle or in the
core of the earth.
In addition, there can be a specific enhancement effect, different from the
MSW one, due to a cumulative build-up of the transition probability for
neutrinos crossing the earth&#8217;s mantle, core and then again mantle (parametric
resonance ). The matter enhancement effects are
expected to take place in a relatively narrow range of neutrino energies, and
it is rather difficult to observe them experimentally. Yet the possibility
of the observation of matter effects on oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos
is very exciting.
    
    
      Since three neutrino flavours are known to exist, oscillations of atmospheric
neutrinos should in general be considered in the full 3-flavour framework
(assuming that no sterile neutrinos take part in these oscillations). As
follows from the analyses of solar and atmospheric neutrino data, there
should be two distinct mass squared difference scales in the three neutrino
framework,  and . The hierarchy  means that one of the three neutrino mass eigenstates (which we
denote ) is separated by the larger mass gap from the other two.
The neutrino mass squared differences thus satisfy
.
We know already
that  should be the main channel of
oscillations whereas  oscillations can
only be present as the subdominant channels. In the 3-flavour framework
this means that the element  of the lepton mixing matrix
() is small.
The smallness of  means that the 
and  oscillations approximately decouple, and
the 2-flavour analysis gives a good first approximation. In terms of the
parametrization () of the lepton mixing matrix, the mixing angle
describing the main channel of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations is
, and its best-fit value following from the SK data is
. This fact and the smallness of  mean that the
mass eigenstate  mainly consists of the flavour eigenstates 
and  with approximately equal weights, while the admixture of
 to this state is small or zero.
    
    
      Can one observe true 3-flavour effects in the atmospheric neutrino
oscillations? In principle, yes. Although in the 2-flavour scheme
 oscillations are not affected by matter,
in the full 3-flavour approach these oscillations are modified by matter
because of the mixing with . These matter effects are, however,
rather small because of the smallness of .
Three-flavour effects can also lead to interesting phenomena in the
subdominant  and 
oscillations. To see this, let us consider the fluxes  and  of
atmospheric  and  in the presence of oscillations.
As we discussed in sec. , in the case of the hierarchy
 the
oscillation
probabilities in the 3-flavour scheme simplify significantly and can be
expressed through the evolution matrix of the effective 2-flavour problem.
Using eqs. () - () one can express  and 
through the corresponding no-oscillation fluxes  and  as
      
      where
.
It is interesting that the subdominant 
oscillations may lead either to an excess or to a deficiency of e-like events
depending on the values of  and . Indeed, the effect of
oscillations on the electron neutrino flux is proportional to the factor
. If one assumes , there will be an excess of
e-like events for  and a deficiency for . The SK best fit is ; for this value of
 there would be no deviation from the prediction for .
However, for upward going neutrinos in the multi-GeV range  is typically
3 &#8211; 3.5 rather than 2, so there should be an excess of e-like events for
 and a deficiency for . Thus, the distortions of the zenith angle distributions of the
e-like events due to the subdominant 
oscillations should depend on the value of the mixing angle 
governing the dominant  oscillation channel.
However, these distortions are expected to be small because of the smallness
of  (notice that the probability  in () and
() vanishes in the limit ).
For recent analyses of the SK atmospheric neutrino data in the 3-flavour
framework, see .
    
    
      If the solution of the solar neutrino problem is the LMA MSW effect,
 can
be as large as  eV and its influence of the atmospheric
neutrino oscillations cannot be neglected. In that case eqs. ()
and () have to be modified. It was shown in  that
in this case the subdominant oscillations can lead to a negative up-down
asymmetry of e-like events at relatively large momenta. If the trend of
slightly decreasing with momentum asymmetry of the e-like events which
can be seen in the left top panel of fig.  is of physical
origin and not just due to statistical fluctuations, it can be
explained by relatively large .
    
    
      Are the standard neutrino oscillations the sole possible explanation of
the observed atmospheric neutrino anomalies? In principle, other explanations
are possible. Those include exotic types of neutrino oscillations &#8211;
matter-induced oscillations due to flavour-changing interactions of neutrinos
with medium , oscillations due to small violations of the Lorentz
or CPT invariance or of the gravitational equivalence principle ,
and also neutrino decay . Exotic oscillations lead to periodic
variations of the  survival probability with the oscillation lengths
 where  in the case of flavour-changing neutrino
interactions or violation of CPT invariance, and  for oscillations
due to the violations of the Lorentz invariance or equivalence principle.
This has to be contrasted with  in the case of the standard neutrino
oscillations. The energy dependence of the oscillation length can be
tested in the atmospheric neutrino experiments as the energies of detected
neutrinos span more than 3 orders of magnitude. The analysis was performed
in , and the authors found that the fit of the atmospheric
neutrino data assuming oscillations with  gives
 at 90% c.l.. This clearly favours the standard oscillations
over the exotic ones. In contrast to this, the neutrino decay mechanism fits
the SK data quite well, the quality of the fit being as good as the one for
the standard neutrino oscillations . However, the assumed
neutrino decay mode (into a sterile neutrino and a Majoron) requires
particle physics models which look less appealing than those that provide
neutrino masses required for the standard neutrino oscillations.
    
    
      Problem 25. Using eqs. () - () of sec. 
derive expressions () and () for the atmospheric
 and  fluxes in the presence of oscillations in the case of
the hierarchy .

    Reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments

    
      In reactor neutrino experiments oscillations of electron antineutrinos
into another neutrino species are searched for by studying possible depletion
of the  flux beyond the usual geometrical one
. These are the disappearance experiments, because
the energies of the reactor &#8217;s ( 3 MeV)
are too small to allow the detection of muon or tauon antineutrinos in CC
experiments. Small  energy makes the reactor neutrino experiments
sensitive to oscillations with rather small values of .
    
    
    
      Up to now, no evidence for neutrino oscillations has been
found in the reactor neutrino experiments, which allowed to exclude
certain regions in the neutrino parameter space. The best
constraints were obtained by the CHOOZ experiment in France 
(see fig. ). As follows from eq. (), in the case
of the hierarchy ,
the survival probability of  (which by CPT invariance is equal to that
of ) in the 3-flavour scheme has a simple form which coincides
with that in the two-flavour framework. Therefore the excluded regions
obtained in the 2-flavour analysis apply to the 3-flavour case as well, with
the identification ,
. For the values of  in the Super-Kamiokande allowed region
 eV, the CHOOZ results give the following
constraint on the element  of the lepton mixing matrix: , i.e.  is either small or close to
unity. The latter possibility is excluded by solar and atmospheric
neutrino observations, and one finally obtains
      
      This is the most stringent constraint on  to date.
    
    
      Presently, a long baseline reactor experiment KamLAND is under construction
in Japan. This will be a large liquid scintillator detector
experiment using the former Kamiokande site. KamLAND will detect electron
antineutrinos coming from several Japanese power reactors at an average
distance of about 180 km. KamLAND is scheduled to start taking data in 2001
and will be sensitive to values of  as low as 
eV, i.e. in the range relevant for the solar neutrino oscillations! It is
expected to be able to probe the LMA solution of the solar neutrino problem
(see fig. ). It may also be able to directly detect solar
B and Be neutrinos after its liquid scintillator has been purified
to ultra high purity level by recirculating through purification .
    
    
    
      In the 3-flavour framework, the oscillations due to the large
 eV should be in the averaging
regime in the KamLAND experiment
and therefore the  survival probability should be described by
eqs. () and () rather than by (). In the
case of SMA, LMA and VO solutions of the solar neutrino problem the
 survival probability at KamLAND is then just , i.e. the mixing angle  is directly
measured. The CHOOZ data allow  for 
in the SK range. In the case of the LMA solution,  where  is the usual 2-flavour
survival probability (). Thus, in this case the 2-flavour
analysis
is modified by a non-vanishing .
    
    
      There have been a number of accelerator experiments looking for neutrino
oscillations. In all but one no evidence for oscillations was found and
constraints on oscillation parameters were obtained .
The LSND Collaboration
have obtained an evidence for  and
 oscillations . The LSND result is the only
indication for neutrino oscillations that is a signal and not a deficiency.
The KARMEN experiment is looking for neutrino oscillations in  channel. No evidence for oscillations has been obtained, and
part of the LSND allowed region has been excluded. In fig. 
(right panel) the results from LSND and KARMEN experiments are shown along
with the relevant constraints from the BNL776 and Bugey experiments. One
can see that the only domain of the LSND allowed region which is presently
not excluded is a narrow strip with  and  eV.
    
    
      The existing neutrino anomalies (solar neutrino problem, atmospheric neutrino
anomaly and the LSND result), if all interpreted in terms of neutrino
oscillations, require three different scales of mass squared differences:
 eV, 
eV and  eV. This is only possible
with four (or more) light neutrino species. The fourth light neutrino cannot
be just the 4th generation neutrino similar to ,  and
 because this would be in conflict with the experimentally measured
width of  boson [see eq. ()]. It can only be an electroweak
singlet (sterile) neutrino. Therefore the LSND result, if correct, would
imply the existence of a light sterile neutrino.
    
    
      Out of all experimental evidences for neutrino oscillations, the LSND result
is the only one that has not yet been confirmed by other experiments. It is
therefore very important to have it independently checked. This will be
done by the MiniBooNE (first phase of BooNE) experiment at Fermilab.
MiniBooNE will be capable of observing both  appearance
and  disappearance. If the LSND signal is due to 
oscillations, MiniBooNE is expected to detect an excess of 1500 
events during its first year of operation, establishing the oscillation signal
at  level (see fig. ). If this happens, the second
detector will be installed, with the goal to accurately measure the
oscillation parameters. MiniBooNE will begin taking data in 2002.
    
    
      A number of long baseline accelerator neutrino experiments have been proposed
to date. They are designed to independently test the oscillation
interpretation of the results of the atmospheric neutrino experiments,
accurately measure the oscillation parameters and to (possibly) identify
the oscillation channel. The first of these experiments, K2K (KEK to
Super-Kamiokande) already started taking data in 1999. It has a baseline
of 250 km and is looking for  disappearance. K2K should be able
to test practically the whole region of oscillation parameters allowed
by the SK atmospheric neutrino data except perhaps the lowest-
part of it (see fig. ). Two other long baseline projects,
NuMI - MINOS (Fermilab to Soudan mine in the US) and CNGS (CERN to Gran
Sasso in Europe), each with the baseline of about 730 km, will be sensitive
to smaller values of  and should be able to test the whole
allowed region of SK (fig. ). MINOS will look for 
disappearance and spectrum distortions due to 
oscillations. It may run in three different energy regimes &#8211; high,
medium and low energy. MINOS is scheduled to start data taking
in the end of 2002. CERN to Gran Sasso will be an appearance experiment
looking specifically for  oscillations. It will also
probe  appearance.
At the moment, two detectors have been approved for participation in the
experiment &#8211; OPERA and ICANOE. The whole project was approved in December
of 1999 and the data taking is planned to begin on May 15, 2005
.
    
    
      Among widely discussed now future projects are neutrino factories &#8211; muon
storage rings producing intense beams of high energy neutrinos.
In addition to high statistics studies of neutrino interactions,
experiments at neutrino factories should be capable of measuring neutrino
oscillation parameters with high precision and probing
the subdominant neutrino oscillation channels, matter effects and CP
violation effects in neutrino oscillations .

    Phenomenological neutrino mass matrices

    
      The information on neutrino masses and lepton mixing obtained in solar
and atmospheric the neutrino experiments can be summarized as follows:
      
      In the 3-flavour framework (neglecting the LSND result), 
has to be identified with
,  with ,  with , and 
with . The 2-flavour analysis gives a good first approximation
to the results of the 3-flavour studies  because the
mixing angle  is constrained to be rather small by the CHOOZ
data ().
    
    
    
      A very concise and illuminating way of summarizing the neutrino data is to
present the neutrino mass eigenstates graphically as rectangles of unit area,
the position of which on the vertical scale reflects their mass whereas
the areas of differently marked parts are equal to , i.e. to
the weights with which the th flavor eigenstate is present in the th
mass eigenstate .
In the 3-flavour framework, the present-day data allow three main
possibilities corresponding to the three main solutions of the solar neutrino
problem. They are shown in fig.  and in fig. 
(left panel). The schemes have different contributions of , 
and  in the two low-lying mass eigenstates. The weight of 
in the mass eigenstate  which is separated from  and  by
a large mass gap is ; it is either small or zero. The weights of
 and  within each mass eigenstate are approximately equal
to each other as a consequence of  and . This, in particular, means that the solar neutrinos oscillate
into an almost equal superposition of  and ,
independently of the type of the solution of the solar neutrino problem
(SMA, LMA, LOW or VO).
The scheme of the left panel of fig. 
corresponds to single large mixing, whereas those of the right panel of
fig.  and left panel of fig.  describe bi-large
or bi-maximal (in the case ) mixing. The 3-flavour schemes of
figs  and  correspond to the so-called normal
neutrino mass hierarchy, . In addition, there are
schemes (not shown in the figures) in which the position of the mass
eigenstate  and of the pair () are interchanged
(inverted mass hierarchy, ). The present-day data
do not discriminate between the normal and inverted hierarchies; such a
discrimination may become possible in future if the earth&#8217;s matter effects
in atmospheric or long baseline  or  oscillations are observed.
    
    
    
      The normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies discussed above do not
exhaust all possible schemes of 3-flavour neutrino mass schemes. Since
neutrino oscillation experiments only allow the determination of neutrino
mass squared differences and not of the masses themselves, it is also possible
that neutrinos are quasi-degenerate in mass, and only their mass squared
differences satisfy the hierarchies shown in figs.  and
. Direct neutrino mass measurements allow the average neutrino
mass as large as a few eV (provided that the  constraint
() is satisfied). In that case neutrinos could constitute a
significant fraction of the dark matter of the universe (hot dark matter).
    
    
      If the LSND result is correct, there should be at least four
light neutrino species. Four-flavour neutrino schemes can be analyzed
similarly to the 3-flavour case. The data allow essentially two schemes.
In each of these schemes there are two pairs of nearly degenerate mass
eigenstates separated by large . The mass splittings
between the components of the quasi-degenerate pairs are 
and . An example of a 4-flavour scheme is shown in
fig.  (right panel). More detailed discussions of the 4-flavour
schemes can be found in .
    
    
    
      The experimental information on the neutrino masses and lepton mixing
angles allows one to reconstruct the phenomenologically allowed forms of the
neutrino mass matrix. This can be done by inverting the relation . The detailed structure of the neutrino
mass matrix  is not yet known since some of the neutrino parameters
are still rather uncertain. However, one can derive the zeroth-approximation
structures (textures) of the neutrino mass matrices just using the already
known gross features of neutrino spectrum and mixing angles. In particular,
in the zeroth approximation one can assume , ,
. Some of the neutrino mass matrix textures that can
be obtained in this way are summarized in Table  taken from
. Notice that these textures are defined only up to the trivial
sign changes due to the rephasing of the neutrino fields.
    
    
      In realistic models, zeros in neutrino mass textures must be filled
with small elements and in addition the large entries can be perturbed
by small corrections. The small entries of the neutrino mass matrices
should satisfy certain constraints; one of them follows from the requirement
that for the LMA and SMA MSW solutions of the solar neutrino problem
the lower-lying of the mass eigenstates  and
 have a larger  component. As was discussed in sec.
, if this condition is not satisfied, the MSW resonance
is only possible for antineutrinos and not for neutrinos. This requirement
on the small entries of the neutrino mass matrices disfavours the inverted
mass hierarchy and quasi-degenerate neutrinos and favours the normal mass
hierarchy .
    
    
      The neutrino mass matrix textures can provide us with a hint of the symmetries
or dynamics underlying the theory of neutrino mass. With the forthcoming data
from future neutrino experiments, it may eventually become possible to unravel
the mechanism of the neutrino mass generation, which may hold the clue to the
general fermion mass problem.
    
    
      We live in a very fascinating time for neutrino physics. It is very
likely that in a few years from now new solar and long baseline neutrino
experiments will bring us an important knowledge about neutrinos allowing
to answer many questions and solving the solar neutrino problem.
Neutrinos may also bring us new surprises, as they did many times in the
past.
