    <abstract>
      <p>In the present lectures the following topics
are considered: general properties of neutrinos, neutrino mass phenomenology
(Dirac and Majorana masses), neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of
the standard model (including the seesaw mechanism), neutrino oscillations in
vacuum, neutrino oscillations in matter (the MSW effect) in 2- and
3-flavour schemes, implications of CP, T and CPT symmetries for neutrino
oscillations, double beta decay, solar neutrino oscillations and the solar
neutrino problem, and atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a short overview of
the results of the accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments and of future
projects. Finally, we discuss how the available experimental data on neutrino
masses and lepton mixing can be summarized in the phenomenologically
allowed forms of the neutrino mass matrix.</p>

      <p>Neutrino physics is a very active field now, both experimentally and
theoretically. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment was put
into operation in 1999; it should add a very important information to
our knowledge of solar neutrinos. The SNO experiment and the forthcoming
Borexino experiment will complement the already existing data of Homestake,
Gallex, SAGE, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments and this will
hopefully lead to the resolution of the long-standing solar neutrino problem.
The first long baseline terrestrial neutrino experiment, K2K, has already
started taking data, and several more experiments &#8211; KamLAND, MINOS,
MiniBooNE and CERN &#8211; Gran Sasso experiments are either scheduled to start
in a very near future or in advanced stage of planning. There are also very
wide discussions of possible next generation long baseline experiments with

      <p>Why are we so much interested in neutrinos? Neutrinos play a very important
role in various branches of subatomic physics as well as in astrophysics
and cosmology. The smallness of neutrino mass is very likely related to
existence of new, yet unexplored mass scales in particle
physics. These scales are so high that their direct experimental study
may not ever be possible. Neutrinos can provide us with a very valuable,
though indirect, information about these mass scales and the new physics
related to these scales. In fact, they may even hold a clue to the general
problem of the fermion mass generation.</p>

physics are considered. These include general properties of neutrinos,
neutrino mass phenomenology, neutrino masses in the simplest extensions of
the standard model (including the seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass
generation), neutrino oscillations in vacuum,
neutrino oscillations in matter (the MSW effect), implications of CP, T and
CPT symmetries for neutrino oscillations, solar neutrino oscillations and
the solar neutrino problem, and atmospheric neutrinos. We also give a
short overview of the results of the accelerator and reactor neutrino
experiments and of future projects. Finally, we discuss how the available
experimental data on neutrino masses and lepton mixing can be summarized in
the phenomenologically allowed forms of the neutrino mass matrix. Except for
the simplest extensions of the standard models, we do not discuss the models
of neutrino mass since they were covered in the lectures of K.S. Babu at

localized in space, neither neutrino energy nor momentum is well defined;
moreover, the transition probability depends on both the neutrino production
