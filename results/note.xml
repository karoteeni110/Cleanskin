  <para>    Analysis of immune network dynamical system model
with small number of degrees of freedom SSatoko Itaya and Tatsuya Uezu Graduate School of Human Culture, Nara Women&#8217;s University, Nara 630, Japan</para><para>    &#167;1.  Introduction</para><para>    In this paper, we consider
an immune network dynamical system model with small degrees of
freedom.</para><para>    First, we explain the present understanding of immune
systems briefly .</para><para>    The main constituents of an immune system are B-lymphocytes(B-cells)
produced in the Bone marrow, T-lymphocytes(T-Cells) produced in
the Thymus and free antibodies produced by B-cells.
B-cells and T-cells have protein molecules called receptors
on their surfaces. The receptors of B-cells are
antibodies(Immunoglobulin, Ig), and antibodies recognize
and connect to antigens to neutralize them.
On the other hand, T-cell receptors(TcR) cannot
recognize antigens, but they recognize pieces of antigens
which appear on the surfaces of antigen presenting cells.
When this happens, as a result,
the helper T-cell expedites the immune response
and the suppressor T-cell suppresses it. The killer T-cell
attacks and kills a cell which is infected by viruses et.al.
The receptors of B- and T-cells have proper 3-dimensional structures
and these are called &#8217;Idiotypes&#8217;.
A family of B-cells which are generated from a B-cell are called
&#8217;clones&#8217;. Therefore, a clone and antibodies produced by the clone
have the same idiotype.</para><para>    In a human body, the total number of clones which are
generated from a single B-cell are about 10 to  , the total
number of clones amounts to   and the number
of antibodies is about  .
Thus, the repertoire of antibodies are enough to bind to
any antigen. This diversity is due to the recombination
and the mutation of genes.</para><para>    The response to the invasion by antigens is considered as follows.
When antigens enter into a body, clones which can recognize
the antigen bind to it, and maturate by the help of
the helper T-cells, and a part of them proliferate.
Others become antibody forming cells.
In the antibody forming cells, many antibodies are produced
and secreted. As a result, many antibodies appear
and neutralize antigens. When the neutralization completes,
by the action of the suppressor T-cells, the proliferation of B-cells
is suppressed and the immune response ends. Further, in the course of the division of B-cells a part of
each B-cells is preserved as a memory B-cell.
When the same antigens enter into the body again,
these cells rapidly differentiate into antibody forming cells
and produce many antibodies in a short time.
This phenomenon is called &#8217;the secondary immune response&#8217;.</para><para>    In the mechanism of the immune response explained above,
a clone of the B-cells which can recognize an antigen
is selected. Thus, this theory is called &#8217;clonal selection theory&#8217;
and has been confirmed experimentally.</para><para>    B-cells, T-cells and antibodies die if they are not stimulated.
As is mentioned above, in a human body there are a huge number
of these cells. To explain this, in 1974 N. K. Jerne
proposed the so-called network view of the immune systems .
In his theory, these cells interact with and activate each other
organizing a network. However, in 10 years after Jerne&#8217;s theory
appeared, the network theory was considered
to fail to live up to its initial promise.
This is because the theory cannot explain the correct
direction of change of the system when antigens invade a body.
Another reason is that since
T-cells and their actions were discovered,
to include these elements the original theory would lose the
simplicity
which attracted many researchers.</para><para>    However, there are several experiments to support
the network theory . For example, in new born mice
activated lymphocytes are retained although mice are isolated
from any antigen. That is, it seems that the immune system
is activated by itself to prepare for the invasion of external
antigens.</para><para>    Thus, taking into account T-cells and their roles
F. J. Varela et.al. proposed the second generation immune
network model in 1991 .
Since then, this theory has been developing .</para><para>    We would like to investigate the effects of the interaction
among lymphocytes and antigens, and to analyze what
kind of states and structures the network can have, and to see
which directions the network moves to when antigens
invade the system.
Also, we have interest in mathematical structures
of network systems from the view point of dynamical systems.</para><para>    In this paper, we study the dynamical system model of immune networks
introduced by Varela et.al.
In this model the essential characteristics
of the real immune systems are taken into account.
That is, not only antibodies, but
also B-lymphocytes which produce antibodies,
and the roles of T-lymphocytes, i.e.,
the activation and the suppression of B-lymphocytes, are included.</para><para>    In reality, an immune system has a huge number
of degrees of freedom. However, in this paper
we focus on the Varela model with small number of degrees of freedom.
Our objective is to investigate the possible states in the network
and the change of these states when antigens invade the system
in small systems, as a necessary step before studying the states
of immune network and the immune response in large systems.
Let us explain the model we treat in this paper.
The constituents of the network, free antibodies and
B-lymphocytes(B-cells), interact with each other through idiotypes.
Let us distinguish idiotypes by index  .
Between two different idiotypes   and  , there may occur an
affinity,
which is represented by the connectivity  .
We assume   if there is an affinity between   and  and   if not.  is measurable by experiments .
Let us denote the concentration
of B-lymphocytes with the  -th idiotype by  and that of free antibodies produced
by the B-lymphocytes by  .
These antibodies have the same idiotype as the
B-lymphocytes.
The sensitivity of the network for the  -th idiotype
is defined as follows; where   is the number of idiotypes.
It represents the strength of the influence by other
antibodies to the  -th antibody.
The number of B-lymphocytes and antibodies
change in time by the following causes.
Free antibodies
are removed from the constituents of the network
because they have a natural lifetime
and also they interact
with other idiotypes and are
neutralized. On the other hand
they are produced by B-cells as a result of the
maturation of B-cells.
The probability of the maturation is assumed to depend
on their sensitivity  .
This effect is expressed by the function  .
In the beginning of immune response,
antibodies which interact with antigens
maturate with help of T-cells. Then, it is natural to assume that
the function   is increasing with respect to  when   is small.
If the number of antibodies becomes large,
and the immune response comes to end, the creation of antibodies
will be suppressed. Thus, for large values of    should be decreasing with respect to  .
Thus,   is assumed to have
the convex profile illustrated
in Fig.1.</para><para>    Then, a differential equation describing
the change in time of the concentration  of the  -th
antibody can be written as where   is the rate of the neutralization by other antibodies,  is the rate of the death of the antibody
and   is the rate of
the creation of the antibodies by B-cells.
Correspondingly B-cells carrying  -th idiotype
on their surfaces decay at a given rate and
proliferate when they maturate.
The probability of the proliferation of B-cells
is represented by the function  .
When B-cells maturate, they begin to proliferate.
Again,   is assumed to be increasing with respect to  when   is small.
When the neutralization of antigens completes,
the proliferation of B-cells is suppressed
by T-cells. Therefore, we assume that  is decreasing with respect to   when   is large.
Thus,   also has the convex shape.
Further, it seems that the proliferation of B-cells ends after their
maturation ends, it is a reasonable assumption that  is shifted to right from  (Fig.1). Then, the evolution equation for
the concentration   of the B-cells
with  -th idiotype can be written as where   is the death rate of the B-cells
and   is the rate of production
of the B-cells. Further, the term  is added to take into account
the cells that are recruited into the active network
from the bone marrow.</para><para>    Here, let us see in detail how   and   work.
First, let us consider  .</para><para>    When the sensitivity   is small, the B-cells are
inactive. If the value of   becomes large,
they are activated to maturate by helper T-cells and begin
to produce antibodies. If the value of  increases further,
the production of antibodies by B-cells
is suppressed by the suppressor T-cells.
As for the behavior of , its behavior is similar to that of . If sensitivity   becomes large,
the B-cells are proliferated by the T-cells
and then they produce many antibodies.
If   increases further,
this action is suppressed also by the T-cells.</para><para>    Next, we describe the version of the Varela model introduced
by H. Bersini and B. Calenbuhr,
which we investigate and modify in
this paper.</para><para>    H. Bersini and V. Calenbuhr  have investigated
a dynamical system model
of immune networks in the above framework using the following
functions of the maturation and the proliferation
in small degrees of freedom(Fig.2).</para><para>    </para><para>    In their model, B-cells and antibodies
with the same idiotype are
considered to form a unit.
By the interaction between two units the two-unit system
oscillates and the phase of
one unit is opposite to that of the other. For a three-unit network, to begin with,
they considered the connection between
two units in an open chain fashion(Fig.3a).
Then, three units can be
constrained with opposite phases each other.</para><para>    Next, they considered the closed network
by connecting three units as shown in Fig.3b.
The connectivity matrix they used is as follows,</para><para>    Although each
pair of units must independently comply
with the imposed constraint
that they oscillate in opposite phases,
it isn&#8217;t possible for all units to satisfy this
constraint. This phenomenon has been designated
by the term &#8221;frustration&#8221; and occurs in a network with
a closed loop composed of an odd number of units.
In general, frustration induces instability.
As a result of this instability,
although the time evolution of each unit resembles
the motion in an open chain network,
this motion does not continue more than several
oscillations, and the network behaves in random way.
In the following section, we investigate
the characteristics of the behaviors in the original model
by Bersini and Calenbuhr. In &#167;3, we modify
the original model by adopting simpler functions
of   and  and see the effects of the choice of these functions.
In the modified model, we consider a threshold over which
each antibody can recognize others.
This is introduced in &#167;4. In &#167;5, we consider the
networks with more than 3 units and investigate
the effect of degrees of freedom.
Then the invasion of antigens is investigated in &#167;6.
Finally, &#167;7 is devoted to summary and discussions. </para><para>    &#167;2.  The characteristics of the original model</para><para>    As is mentioned in the introduction,
the system exhibits periodic oscillations
for both the cases of two units and
of the three-units open chain.
On the other hand, for the case of the three-units
closed chain, the system exhibits
stable chaotic oscillations.</para><para>    In this system, there always exists the following fixed point</para><para>    and this point is stable. However,
this solution has no meaning as a network
because the interaction between units does not exist.</para><para>    First, to investigate the instability of the system,
we calculated Lyapunov characteristic exponents in the original model
and obtained the following result for the Lyapunov spectrum, This implies that the resultant strange attractor
of this system is rather complicated in structure
because there are two positive exponents.</para><para>    Since this model has permutational symmetry,
it should be checked whether the chaos is robust
with respect to symmetry breaking perturbations.
To investigate this,
we gave random values around 1 to  for   with   fixed to 0,
and studied the time evolution of the system.
We found that chaotic behaviors could also be obtained for
asymmetric systems.
Thus the chaos in this model is robust
and the cause of appearance of chaos
is not the symmetry of the system.</para><para>    Next, to see how chaos appears in this system,
we changed
the strength of connectivity retaining
the permutational symmetry in the system.
To be specific, we set the
connectivity matrix as follows, and lowered   from 1 to 0.
Then, we obtained the following results. See Fig.4.</para><para>    Until a rather small value of  , the system exhibits
chaotic motion. When   is less than  ,
a trajectory converges to the fixed point.
Thus, when the connectivity is small,
this model is not adequate to describe the
immune network. On the other hand, when we increased   from 1,
at   a limit cycle appears and this breaks the
permutational symmetry of numbering of units.</para><para>    As is shown in Fig.5(a),
the phase portraits of two of the units are the same but
they oscillate in opposite phases to each other. We call these units
long-pulse units. One unit has smaller amplitude than those of
the other two units. We call it the short-pulse unit.
Let us see the characteristic feature of the oscillation of
this limit cycle. Let us take notice of the time series of antibodies
(Fig.5(b)).
At almost all times, one of the long-pulse units
has a large value of the concentration but
others have small values.
When the largest concentration of a long-pulse unit, say  ,
becomes small, the other two   and   increase taking similar
values
initially, then at some value of the concentrations,
the concentration of the other long-pulse unit, say  ,
becomes large and the short-pulse unit   becomes small.
Next, when   becomes small,
this time   and   increase taking similar value and  becomes large and   becomes small.
Thus, it seems that the short-pulse unit plays a role of &#8217;switching&#8217;
of the activation of the long-pulse units.
We call this state a clustering state. As   is increased further, at  .
the permutational symmetry breaks completely and the medium-pulse unit
appears. This state also can be called a clustering state
and the role of switching is played by the short-pulse unit. At  , the concentrations   and  in one unit are nearly equal to 0.
Since this unit merely affects other units,
we do not regard this state as a clustering state.</para><para>    As for the route to chaos at  ,
it is considered to be Intermittency
by heteroclinic intersections It is reported by other authors that when some parameter is
changed, this system shows Intermittency . .
The sudden disappearance of chaos at  seems to be crisis, that is, the basin of chaos
intersects with that of stable fixed point.</para><para>    There are several characteristic
features of this model by Bersini and Calenbuhr,
those are, the topological dimension of the resultant
strange attractor is three, the chaos is hyperchaos, and
the switching in the clustering state.
Since in this model the functions   and  are rather complicated,
it is interesting to investigate
whether these features are due to the special choice of these
functions.
In order to see the effect of these functions,
we modify the above model by choosing
simpler functions   and  .
In the next section, we go into this study.</para><para>    &#167;3.  Modified model</para><para>    We change the functions of the maturation and the proliferation as
follows, where  and   are constants.
In Fig.6 we show the graphs of these functions. They look rather
similar to those of the previous functions.</para><para>    When the above functions are adopted
as   and   ,
in the case of two units, the system converges to
a fixed point and in the case of the three-unit
closed chain, a strange attractor appears.
See Fig.7.</para><para>    The Lyapunov spectrum for chaos becomes as follows. Then, chaos in this system has lower dimension
than that in the original system.</para><para>    To investigate the onset mechanism of chaos,
we drew the bifurcation diagram decreasing
the magnitude of connection matrix in
the same manner as in the previous section.
See Fig.8.</para><para>    When   is decreased from 1 or increased from 1, the transition from
the strange attractor to a limit cycle takes
place suddenly at   or  , respectively.
For the limit cycle state which appears below  ,
two of three units oscillate in opposite phases,
and the other unit takes negligibly small values.
See Fig.9.</para><para>    On the other hand, for the limit cycle state which appears above  ,
two of three units oscillate in opposite phases,
and the other unit oscillates with smaller values.
That is, the permutational symmetry is broken in
these states. The limit cycle state which appears above  is considered to be a clustering state as discussed in &#167;2.
See Fig.5 and Fig.10.</para><para>    To see the bifurcation phenomena below   in detail,
we calculated the first Lyapunov characteristic
exponent while decreasing the strength   of the
connection matrix. See Fig.11.</para><para>    There exists a definite critical point.
In the chaos region, time series of  exhibit regular oscillations
interrupted by irregular motion.
Thus the route to chaos
from the limit cycle is Intermittency.
In fact, we confirmed that in both transitions to chaos
taking place at larger and smaller values of   than  ,
the routes to chaos are
Intermittency by heteroclinic intersections as in the original
model.</para><para>    As for the robustness,
we checked that the system is robust with respect to
permutational symmetry breaking perturbation
as in the original model.</para><para>    From the results in this section,
we conclude that except for the topological dimensionality of the
chaos,
which is two in this model and three in the original one,
all features are the same as those in the original model.
Thus, the modified model is simpler than the original model.</para><para>    &#167;4.  The modified model with threshold</para><para>    In this section, we introduce a threshold over which
antibodies can recognize antibodies and antigens.
There are several reasons to take
the threshold into account.
One is that it seems that there exists some threshold for
the concentration of antibodies to recognize antigens.
Another reason is that we would like to consider the situation
in which the concentration of an antigen can become large
without being recognized by antibodies for some reason.
As such a situation we can consider the case that
the ability of detecting antigens in the immune system
becomes weak. Further, as a technical reason,
introducing thresholds makes it possible to define states
clearly.</para><para>    When the threshold is introduced, the system exhibits various
interesting behaviors. </para><para>     </para><para>    In the three-unit closed chain system, we
introduce a threshold over which the  -th antibody
can recognize other antibodies.
For simplicity we take the common value   of thresholds for
all antibodies as follows, That is, where   is the Heaviside function, i.e.,
  for   and 0 for  .
Hereafter,   in the right hand side of the above equation
is fixed to the value in eq.(6).
We scanned the value of the threshold   every 5 values
and obtained the following behaviors of the system.</para><para>    For  , the system is in the clustering state
which is defined in &#167;2.
In this state, each of three units oscillates taking
values below and over the threshold. Two long-pulse units
have longer duration over the threshold and the short-pulse unit
has shorter duration.</para><para>    For the time series analysis, we define the on-off time series
as follows.
Let us associate 0 or 1 with each unit according to the value
of  , that is, 0 for   and 1 for  .
We call the former the off-state and the latter
the on-state,
and the sequence of 0 and 1 as a function of time
the on-off time series.
As shown in Fig.15,
at almost all times, there exists only one
on-state, and whenever the long-pulse unit changes
from the on-state
to the off-state, the short-pulse unit becomes the on-state.
That is, the short-pulse unit plays a role of switching.
This is the same phenomenon as observed in &#167;2 and &#167;3.</para><para>    Thus, this phenomenon takes place in all models we studied.
The cause of this phenomenon is ascribed to the nature of
the interaction.
We discuss this in the final section.</para><para>    If we take an initial state such that
all units are less than the threshold,
the system converges to the fixed point. On the other hand,
if at least one unit exceeds the threshold initially,
then the system goes to the clustering state.</para><para>    We investigated the bifurcation structure
when the system is in the clustering state for  .
To see the bifurcation structure clearly,
we introduce the strength of effective interaction  .
  is defined by the following relation,</para><para>    For example, if  
and  , then   and  .
Thus,   and
 . See Fig.16.</para><para>    As   is lowered, the initial periodic state for  
becomes chaos at  , and
the permutational symmetry is recovered.
See Fig.17.
When   is lowered further,
the periodic state appears again at  (Fig.18).</para><para>    We show the bifurcation diagram (Fig.19)
and the   dependence of   (Fig.20).</para><para>    Here, we summarize the result. From these observations, we note that   can be used
to distinguish the clustering state from other behaviors.
In particular, in the state of chaos, all the   take
almost the same value.</para><para>    The Lyapunov spectrum for chaos is and is the same as in the modified model.</para><para>    The routes to chaos at   and   are
also Intermittency by the heteroclinic intersections.</para><para>    &#167;5. The effect of the degree of freedom</para><para>    Here we investigate the behaviors of the network
when the number of units is increased
for the modified model with threshold.
We assume that there exists interactions between
any two units and the
connectivity matrix is symmetric, i.e.,  
for any   and    .</para><para>    We investigated the cases of  .
In Fig.21 and 22,
we show phase portraits for several cases.</para><para>    The clustering state occurs in all cases. However, it seems that
it takes place more frequently in the case
of the odd number of units in the parameter ranges which we
investigated.
(Fig.21, 22)</para><para>    Indeed, for   and 9 and when the threshold is the same
for all units, clustering takes place
and for   and 10, it does not.
In the figures 21(b) and 22(b), we show the effective
interactions schematically. In these figures
thick lines denote large strength, thin lines represent medium
strength and dotted lines represent small strength.
When the clustering occurs, the system is in a limit cycle state,
and the number of the long-pulse units is larger by one than that of
the
short-pulse units.
There are three values of the strength of the effective interaction in
the system. See Fig.22(b).
The strength of the effective interaction takes the largest value
  between two long-pulse units, the smallest  
between two short-pulse units
and intermediate value between the long-pulse unit
and the short-pulse unit. When the clustering does not occur in the
system,
the strengths of the effective interactions are almost the same.
See Fig.21(b). We show the on-off time series for
 (Fig.15),  (Fig.23),
 (Fig.24(a)) and  (Fig.24(b)).</para><para>    From these figures we note that
for   and 5, there are only
two types of units, i.e., long-pulse units and short-pulse units.
On the other hand, for   and 6, in any unit,
the duration time of the on-state varies in time.
To clarify this we calculate the histogram of the duration time.
See Fig.25, 26, 27, 28.
In the case of odd number of units, we
notice that the duration time   for the long pulse unit
is nearly twice as the duration time  
for the short-pulse unit. On the other hand,
in the case of even member of units, although
there are various duration times,
we can find two peaks of the long duration time and the short one.
That is, in the chaotic state, the role of
each unit changes dynamically.</para><para>    &#167;6. The invasion of antigen Hereafter, we consider the response of the system to the invasion of
antigens in the modified model with threshold.</para><para>    Case 1 </para><para>    We consider the clustering state in the 3-units closed network.
Suppose that external antigens
similar to antibodies   invade the system.
Let us denote the concentration of the antigen by   and that
of the corresponding antibodies by  .
Then, antibodies   and   recognize the antigens,
because   resemble  .
However, in general the antibodies   cannot recognize the
antigens.
See Fig.29.</para><para>    Further, we assume that the antigen does
not proliferate by itself .
Thus, the differential equation for the antigen is given by where  .
Here, we assume that the antigens enter into the
system at a rate   per unit time.
On the other hand, since antibodies   and
  interact with the antigens,
  and  
become  
and  ,
respectively.
Then using these  s the equations for antibodies and B-cells
are the same as the previous ones.</para><para>    Now, let us see what happens in this system.
The behavior of the system depends on the
increase rate of the antigen  .
If   is large enough, say  ,
the concentration of the antigen   increases
infinitely and the system is completely invaded
and destroyed by the antigen .
If   is less than some value, say  ,
the system copes with the antigens completely.
The number of antigens finally become small and the system
settles near to a clustering state depending on
the initial condition. Thus, in this case
there is no memory of the invasion by antigens.</para><para>    If we set   between   and  ,
e.g.,  ,   does not increase
infinitely but oscillates in some range
of concentration.
The time series of   and the phase portrait of the system are
drawn
in Fig.30 and 31, respectively.</para><para>    Although the system is modified because of the
invasion by the antigen, for  , it still keeps the
nature of the network as a whole.
In the resultant state, the duration time of
the on-state for   and   are longer,
i.e., the units 2 and 3 are long-pulse units.</para><para>    Now, let us study the response time of the system when .
To do this, starting from   we calculated the relaxation time
in which the concentration of the antigen becomes
negligibly small. See Figure 32.</para><para>    From this figure, we note that the response time is shorter in
the state in which the units 2 and 3 are
in the long-pulse units.
In the resultant attractor the units 2 and 3 are the long-pulse units.
This result implies
that the system modifies itself
so as to neutralize the antigen as effectively as possible.
Thus, it seems that the resultant state can respond
much better than other states.  Therefore, we can state
that the resultant attractor is viewed as
a kind of memory of the invasion
by the antigen.</para><para>    Further, we scanned the initial value of   with  
fixed to 0.7. For  , the system settles
to a clustering state. On the other hand, for  
the system tends to a fixed point and the network collapses.</para><para>    Case 2 </para><para>    Next, we consider the case that an antigen  
interacts only with the antibody   in the 3-unit closed network.
(Fig.33).</para><para>    In this case, we set the thresholds depending on units in order to
obtain clustering states.
Here, we introduce new notations of thresholds,  ,  and   as follows.  is the threshold over which the  -th antibody
recognizes other antibodies.   is the
threshold over which the antibody   recognizes
the antigen and   is the
threshold over which the antigen  recognizes the antibody  .
Then the equation for the antigen   is The first term expresses the decrease of the antigen
by neutralization by the antibody 1 and the second term represents
the continuous invasion of the antigen.
The sensitivity   of the  -th unit is modified to where   is the strength of the
interaction between   and  .
We put  , where  is the Kronecker&#8217;s delta.
The behavior of this network strongly depends
on the thresholds, the value of connectivity  ,
the initial value of the antigen  and the rate of invasion of the antigen  .
If these values are taken appropriately,
the concentration of the antigen oscillates in some range.
See Fig.34.</para><para>    As in the case 1, the unit 1 which can
interact with the antigen is activated and
finally settles near to the long-pulse state.
See Fig.35.</para><para>    It turns out that the relaxation time of the
concentration of the antigen is comparable in this state
with in the state where
the unit 1 is in the short-pulse state.
See Fig.36.</para><para>    When we compare this result with the result in the case 1,
it is considered that the number of units
which can interact with antigens is important for the
relaxation time.</para><para>    Case 3 </para><para>    Now, let us consider the network with 4-units.
We assume that the antigen ( ) has
a similar three-dimensional structure to the
antibody 1 and then can interact
with the unit 2, 3 and 4, but cannot interact
with the unit 1.
See Fig.37.</para><para>    The differential equation for the antigen is For the unit  , the differential equations are</para><para>    If we break the symmetry of the connectivity matrix
by lowering the threshold of one of the four units,
for some initial condition this
unit stays in the short-pulse state
and other units stay in the long-pulse states,
and so the clustering takes place(Fig.38).
For some other initial conditions, chaotic states appear.
That is, in this case chaos and
the clustering states coexist.</para><para>    From the result of the case 1, it is expected that
the relaxation time of the system is short
when the unit which resembles the antigen
is in the short-pulse state.
Further, from the result of the case 2,
it is expected that the more is the number of units
which interact with the antigens, the shorter is the relaxation time.
Thus, here we investigate the relaxation time for the
following three cases.</para><para>    Case a. The unit 1 is in the short-pulse state.</para><para>    Case b. The unit 1 is in the long-pulse state.</para><para>    Case c. The system is chaos.</para><para>    We show the result in Fig.39.</para><para>    The relaxation time   for the case a
is shortest and   for the case b
is longest.   for the case c is
in between   and  .
From this result, it is considered that
chaos is more effective than the clustering states
to prepare for various types of antigens.</para><para>    &#167;7. Summary and discussions</para><para>    In this paper, we studied the three models of the immune network
for small number of degrees of freedom  ,
the original model introduced by Bersini et.al.,
the modified model with different functions
of the maturation and the proliferation of B-cells
from those of the original model, and the modified model
with a threshold over which antibodies can recognize other antibodies
and antigens. First, we summarize common characteristics
of these models.</para><para>    In these models there exist limit cycle states and chaotic states.
We investigated bifurcation structures obtained by
changing several parameters
and found that the transitions to chaos are Intermittency
by heteroclinic intersections.</para><para>    There is a peculiar type of limit cycle.
In this limit cycle, the permutational symmetry of the system
is broken and concentrations of antibodies and B-cells
oscillate in a characteristic manner. We call this the clustering
state. In the clustering state, for example in the
three-unit system,
there are two long-pulse units
in which the concentrations of antibodies are large
and one short-pulse unit in which the concentration
of the antibody is small.
Two long-pulse units oscillate in anti-phase to each other.
At almost all times, only one unit has a
large concentration of the antibody.
The short-pulse unit
plays a role of &#8221;switching&#8221; the long-pulse units which
take the large concentrations.</para><para>    On the other hand, in the state of chaos,
no such explicit division of roles exist,
but each unit changes its role dynamically.
That is, in chaos, a dynamical
change of roles takes place.</para><para>    We investigated the invasion by antigens
when the clustering takes place.
We found that
when the number of antigens is not too many and interaction between
antigens and antibodies continues for an appropriate period,
the unit which can interact with
antigens settles near to the long-pulse unit after
the concentration of antigens is reduced to small values
in some range of a parameter.</para><para>    By investigating the relaxation time,
we found that in the clustering state
the relaxation time depends on what state
the system stays in.
In the case 1 that the two units interact with antigens
the relaxation time is short or long
when the unit which interacts with antigens is in the long-pulse unit
or short-pulse unit, respectively.
On the other hand, in the case 2 that
only one unit interacts with antigens
the relaxation time takes similar value both in the long-pulse
unit and in the short-pulse unit.
Thus, if many units can interact with antigens
by the invasion of the antigens
the system moves to the state in which the response to
antigens is most efficient. Thus, the clustering state is
considered to be a memory of the invasion by antigens.</para><para>    Further, we checked that the system is robust
against the symmetry breaking perturbations.
Chaotic and periodic states change only a little by these
perturbations.</para><para>    As for the modified model with thresholds, we observed a interesting
feature.
The feature is the positive aspect of chaos
in response to the invasion by antigens.
In this model there is the coexistence of chaos and clustering states
when
the thresholds are chosen appropriately depending on units.
In the response to the antigen invasion,
we found that
the relaxation time in chaotic state
takes an intermediate value between the large
and the small response times in the two types of clustering states.
This suggests a positive aspect of chaos in immune networks,
that is, the possibility that chaos
may cope with the invasion by any kinds of
antigens equally well.</para><para>    Now, let us discuss the cause of
the appearance of clustering state.
This is related to the mechanism of the switching of long-pulse units
or the dynamical role change.</para><para>    Let us consider the 3-unit closed chain.
See Fig.5(b), 10(b) and 40.
In the present interaction, any two units tend to
oscillate in opposite phases.
If the concentration of the antibody
in one unit, say  , increases,
then the sensitivities of other two units become large.
By this, the second terms of the differential equations for   and become large and   and   decrease.
This is a kind of &#8217;winner takes all&#8217; mechanism.
Then, the sensitivity   becomes small.
Thus, when   becomes large, the third term
of the differential equation for   becomes small
compared to the other two terms. Thus,
next   begins decreasing.
This causes the decrease of   and  and the increase of   and  .
Since   and   begin to increase from small values,
these take similar values. However, when these become rather large,
two units are forced to stay in states
with opposite phases each other.
Thus, one increases further and the other decreases.
At this stage, for the clustering state,
the increasing unit is fixed to the long-pulse
unit, but for chaos, it is not fixed and the dynamical change of the
switching role takes place.
Therefore, the behavior of the switching is
due to the &#8217;winner takes all&#8217; mechanism and the
&#8217;anti-ferro&#8217; type interaction between any two units.</para><para>    Next, let us discuss the causes of different behaviors
between the original model and the modified model without
threshold. We studied influences of each of the terms
in the 3-unit closed chain system.
We pay attention to the unit 1 only,
( , ),
because we consider the case that
the system has the permutational symmetry.
The differential equations of   and  
are Here, we denote each term in the above equations as
follows. We compare the time sequence in the original model
with that in the modified model.
See Fig.41,42.</para><para>    In these figures, solid lines denote  and  , large dotted lines represent
  and  , small dotted lines represent
  and  , respectively.
We note that the terms concerning the
maturation and the proliferation give the biggest influence on
the behaviors of the system in both the models.
In the original model these terms increase and
decrease more rapidly than in the modified model. The chaos in the original model is hyperchaos but that in the modified
model
is not hyperchaos.
The complexity and the large topological
dimensionality for chaos in the original model
seem to be due to sharp behaviors of these functions.
However, to clarify the influence of the choice of
these functions, it is necessary to perform further investigation.
This is left to a future study.</para><para>    We considered the threshold
over which the antibodies can recognize other antibodies.
We can also consider a threshold over which
the antigen can be recognized by other antibodies.
This is another situation to be investigated.</para><para>    In this study, we investigated
three cases of invasions by antigens.
In these cases, we have interest in
the generic behaviors of the system
when the several parameters are changed, e.g.,
the initial values of antigens or the input
rate of the antigen  , etc.
We found that in some cases the system
changes in a positive way,
that is, in the resultant state the relaxation time becomes
shorter if there are plural units which interact with antibodies.
There exists a kind of memory in the system.
From the perspective of the real immune network,
the existence of memory states and the response to
the invasion by antigens in a system with
large number of degrees of freedom are very
interesting problems. These will be studied in the future.</para><para>    Acknowledgements</para><para>    The authors are grateful to S. Tasaki, S. Kitsunezaki
