The interaction of a small vortex ring with the free surface of a perfect fluid 
is considered. In the frame of the point ring approximation the asymptotic
expression for the Fourier-components of radiated surface waves is obtained
in the case when the vortex ring comes from infinity and has both horizontal 
and vertical components of the velocity. The non-conservative corrections 
to the equations of motion of the ring, due to Cherenkov radiation, are derived.
