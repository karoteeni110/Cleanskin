The interaction of a small vortex ring with the free surface of a perfect fluid 
is considered. In the frame of the point ring approximation the asymptotic
expression for the Fourier-components of radiated surface waves is obtained
in the case when the vortex ring comes from infinity and has both horizontal 
and vertical components of the velocity. The non-conservative corrections 
to the equations of motion of the ring, due to Cherenkov radiation, are derived.

\section{Introduction}

The study of interaction  between vortex structures in a fluid and 
the free surface is important both from practical and theoretical points of 
view. In general, a detailed investigation of this problem is very hard. 
Even the theories of potential surface waves 
and the dynamics of vortices in an infinite space taken 
separately still have a lot of unsolved fundamental problems on their own.
Only the consideration of significantly simplified models can help us 
to understand the processes which take place in the combined system.

In many cases it is possible to neglect the compressibility of the fluid 
as well as the energy dissipation.
Therefore the model of ideal homogeneous incompressible fluid is very
useful for hydrodynamics. Because of the conservative nature of this model 
the application of the well developed apparatus of Hamiltonian dynamics
becomes possible \cite{Arnold} \cite{ZK97}.  
An example of effective use of the Hamiltonian
formalism in hydrodynamics is the introduction of canonical
variables for investigations of potential flows of perfect fluids with a 
free boundary. V.E.Zakharov showed
at the end of the sixties \cite{Z68} that the surface shape $z=\eta(x,y,t)$
and the value of the velocity potential $\psi(x,y,t)$ on the surface can be
considered as generalized coordinate and momentum, respectively.

It is important to note that a variational formulation
of Hamiltonian dynamics  in many cases allows to obtain good finite-dimensional
approximations which reflect the main features of the behavior of the original system.
There are several possibilities
for a parameterization of non-potential flows of perfect fluid by
some variables with dynamics determined by a variational principle.
All of them are based on the conservation of the topological characteristics
of vortex lines in ideal fluid flows which follows from the freezing-in of 
the vorticity field ${\bf \Omega }({\bf r},t)=\mbox{curl}\,{\bf v}({\bf r},t)$.
In particular, this is the representation of the vorticity 
by Clebsch canonical variables $\lambda$ and $\mu$ 


\section{Vortex lines motion in perfect fluid}

It is a well known fact that the freezing-in of the vorticity lines 
follows from the Euler equation for ideal fluid motion
$$
{\bf\Omega}_t=\mbox{curl}\,[{\bf v}\times{\bf\Omega}], \qquad
{\bf v}=\mbox{curl}^{-1}\,{\bf\Omega }
$$
Vortex lines are transported by the flow \cite{Arnold},\cite{Lamb},\cite{LL6}. 
They do not appear or disappear, 
neither they intersect one another in the process of motion.
This property of perfect fluid flows is general for all Hamiltonian systems of 
the hydrodynamic type.
For simplicity, let us consider temporally the incompressible fluid without 
free surface in infinite space. The dynamics of the system is specified
by a basic Lagrangian $L[{\bf v}]$, which is a functional of the solenoidal velocity
field. The relations between the velocity ${\bf v}$,
the generalized vorticity ${\bf\Omega}$, the basic Lagrangian $L[{\bf v}]$ and
the Hamiltonian ${\cal H}[{\bf\Omega}]$ are the following \cite{R99}\footnote{
For the ordinary ideal hydrodynamics in infinite space the basic Lagrangian is
$$
L_{Euler}[{\bf v}]=\int \frac{{\bf v}^2}{2}d{\bf r}\qquad 


\section{Point ring approximation}

In general case an analysis of the dynamics defined by the Lagrangian 
(\ref{Lagr1}) is too much complicated. We do not even have the exact expression for
the Hamiltonian ${\cal H}[{\bf R},\Psi,\eta]$ because it needs the 
explicit knowledge of the solution of the Laplace equation with a boundary value 
assigned on a non-flat surface. Another reason is the very high nonlinearity
of the problem.

In this paper we consider some limits where it 
is possible to simplify the system significantly. Namely, we will 
suppose that the vorticity is concentrated in several very thin vortex 
rings of almost ideal shape. For a solitary ring the perfect shape 
is stable for a wide range of vorticity distributions through the cross-section. 
This shape provides an extremum of the energy for given values of the volumes
of vortex tubes  and for a fixed momentum of the ring. As already 
mentioned, volume conservation follows from  Noether's theorem.
Therefore some of these quantities (those of which 
are produced by the subset of commuting transformations) 
can be considered as canonical momenta.
Corresponding cyclical coordinates describe the relabeling (\ref{nu_relabl})
of the line markers, which doesn't change the vorticity field. Actually these 
degrees of freedom take into account a rotation around the central line of the 
tube. This line represents the mean shape of the ring and we are interested in how
it behaves in time. For our analysis we don't need the explicit values 
of cyclical coordinates, but only the conserved volumes as parameters 
in the Lagrangian. 

A possible situation is  
when a typical time of the interaction with the surface and with other rings is
much larger then the largest period of oscillations corresponding to deviations 
of the ring shape from perfect one. Under this condition, excitations of all 
(non-cyclical) internal degrees of freedom are small during all the time, 
and a variational anzats completely disregarding them 
reflects the behavior of the system adequately. The circulations

\section{Interaction of the vortex ring with its image}

Now let us for simplicity consider the case of a single ring.
It is shown in the next section, 
that for a sufficiently deep ring the interaction with its image 
is much stronger than the interaction with the surface waves.
So it is interesting to examine the motion of the 
ring neglecting the surface deviation. 
In this case we have the integrable Hamiltonian for the system 
with two degrees of freedom


\section{Cherenkov interaction of a vortex ring with surface waves}

When the ring is not very far from the surface and not very slow, 
the interaction with the surface waves becomes significant. 
Let us consider the effect of Cherenkov radiation of surface waves 
by a vortex ring which moves from the infinity to the surface. 
This case is the most definite from the viewpoint of initial conditions choice.
We suppose that the deviation of the free surface from the horizontal plane 
$z=0$ is zero at $t\to-\infty$, and we are interested in the asymptotic 
behavior of fields $\eta$ and $\psi$ at large negative $t$. 
In this situation we can neglect the interaction of the ring with its 
image in comparison with the self-energy 
and concentrate our attention on interaction with surface waves only.


The ring moves in the $(x,z)$-plane with an
almost constant velocity. In the main approximation the position 
${\bf R}$ of the vortex ring is given by the relations


\section{Conclusions and acknowledgments}

In this paper we have derived the simplified Lagrangian for the description
of the motion of deep vortex rings under free surface of perfect fluid. 
We have analyzed the integrable dynamics corresponding to the pure
interaction of the single point vortex ring with its image. It was found that
there are three types of qualitatively different behaviour of the ring. 
The interaction of the ring with the surface has an attractive
character in all three regimes.
The Fourier-components of radiated Cherenkov waves were calculated
for the case when the vortex ring comes from infinity and has both horizontal 
and vertical components of the velocity. The non-conservative corrections 
to the equations of motion of the ring, due to Cherenkov radiation, 
were derived. Due to these corrections the track of the ring bends towards
the surface faster then in the case of flat surface.
For simplicity, all calculations in Sec.5 were performed 
for a single ring. The generalization for the case of many 
rings is straightforward.
