    It is well known that there is a particle-hole symmetry for spin-polarized electrons with two-body interactions in a partially filled Landau level, which becomes exact in the limit where the cyclotron energy is large compared to the interaction strength, so one can ignore mixing between Landau levels. This symmetry is explicit in the description of a half-filled Landau level recently introduced by D. T. Son, using Dirac fermions, but it was thought to be absent in the older fermion-Chern-Simons approach, developed by Halperin, Lee, and Read and subsequent authors. We show here, however, that when properly evaluated, the Halperin, Lee, Read (HLR) theory gives results for long-wavelength low-energy physical properties, including the Hall conductance in the presence of impurities and the positions of minima in the magnetoroton spectra for fractional quantized Hall states close to half-filling, that are identical to predictions of the Dirac formulation. In fact, the HLR theory predicts an emergent particle-hole symmetry near half filling, even when the cyclotron energy is finite.

    <para>
      A series of recent developments have focused renewed attention on the problem of a two-dimensional system of interacting electrons at, or close to, a half-filled Landau level. In particular, in a highly original work, D. T. Son has proposed a description of the half-filled Landau level that employs a collection of relativistic Dirac fermions, interacting with an emergent gauge field with no Chern-Simons term. This description stands in contrast to the more traditional description in terms of non-relativistic &#8220;composite fermions&#8221; interacting with a Chern-Simons gauge field, developed by Halperin, Lee and Read (HLR) and others, some twenty years ago. (See, e.g., Refs.&#160;).
    </para><para>
      The Son-Dirac description has led to a number of valuable insights into the conventional problem of two-dimensional electrons in a strong magnetic field, and it has also served to elucidate connections to other physical problems, such as exotic electronic states that could arise at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, time-reversal invariant  quantum spin liquids in three dimensions, and a class of field theory dualities in  dimensions.
    </para><para>
      The Dirac picture seems to have
some significant advantages compared with the HLR description for the conventional two-dimensional electron system, in particular with respect to particle-hole (PH) symmetry.
It is well known that a partially-filled Landau level of spin-polarized electrons with two-body interactions should have an exact PH symmetry about half-filling, in the limit where the electron-electron interaction is weak compared to the cyclotron energy, so one can neglect mixing between Landau levels. Numerical calculations, either through trial wave functions motivated by the composite fermi liquid picture, or through unbiased energetic calculations, seem to confirm that this symmetry is unbroken in the incompressible phase. This symmetry is made manifest in the Dirac model by setting a single parameter equal to zero, the Dirac mass .
    </para><para>
      By contrast, the HLR approach is not explicitly PH symmetric, and in fact it has been questioned whether the approach is even compatible with PH symmetry.
It has been suggested that the Dirac theory and the HLR theory actually represent different fixed points and that there might necessarily be some kind of discontinuous phase transition separating these fixed points.
These suggestions have been based on analyses of several key physical properties, in which it appeared that predictions of HLR were contradictory to PH symmetry.
    </para><para>
      In this paper, we reexamine several of these properties, and we find that
when properly analyzed, the HLR theory gives identical results to the Dirac theory, in the limit of long wavelengths and low energies,
near half filling. Some of the confusion about these points has arisen simply because the predictions of HLR theory were not previously analyzed with sufficient care.
Despite our limitations to long-wavelengths and low-energies, we believe that our analysis casts strong doubt on the possibility that there is any regime of parameters in which the Dirac description and the HLR description correspond to two different phases of matter.
Specifically, we have carried out detailed studies of two types of properties where it has been suggested that there are irreconcilable differences between the HLR and Son-Dirac descriptions &#8211; the Hall conductance of a half-filled Landau level in the presence of disorder, and the momentum values of the minima in the magnetoroton spectra of fractional quantized Hall states that are symmetrically displaced from .
    </para><para>
      In the presence of a
disorder potential that is statistically PH symmetric, symmetry dictates that the Hall conductance should be exactly , in the absence of Landau level mixing. Since 1997, it has been widely believed that HLR is incompatible with this requirement, and that HLR implies deviations in the Hall conductance proportional to the inverse square of the mean-free path of the composite fermions.
We show below, however, that when properly evaluated, these deviations are absent in the HLR theory, at least in the case of weak, long-wavelength, disorder potentials.
    </para><para>
      For a system where the electronic filling factor  is close to one half, oscillations in the conductivity at finite wave vector  and frequency  have been predicted, and in some cases observed, as a function of the deviations from half filling. These oscillations involve excitation or modulation at a non-zero wave vector , where maxima or minima in some characteristic of the response are predicted to occur at a series of values of , approximately given by
      
      where  is the -th zero of the  Bessel function,  is the deviation of the magnetic field from the field at half filling, and  is the Fermi wave vector of the composite fermions. PH symmetry requires that if the electron density is varied, while the magnetic field is held fixed, the wave vectors  should be precisely independent of the sign of . In the Son-Dirac theory,
Eq.&#160;() directly obeys this PH symmetry, because the value of  is a constant, determined by the magnetic field, independent of the electron density. In HLR, however,  is determined by the electron density, which will be slightly different for positive and negative values of .
Therefore, if one were to treat Eq.&#160;() as an exact equality, using the definition of  in HLR, one would find that PH symmetry is obeyed to first order in , but is violated at second order.
    </para><para>
      We show below that a careful evaluation of the locations of minima in the magnetoroton excitation spectrum in fractional quantum Hall states close to , originally discussed by Simon and Halperin (SH), using the HLR approach, gives
predictions that are PH symmetric, at least to order . We show that these predictions coincide with the predictions of the Son-Dirac theory. The SH formulas actually contain corrections to Eq.&#160;(), which vanish in the limit  but are non-zero at order  and which precisely eliminate the PH asymmetry at this order.
    </para><para>
      We note that the results described above were both obtained by careful evaluation of the HLR theory at the RPA level, and did not require any explicit assumption of particle hole symmetry, or any apparent assumption about the ratio between the electron interaction strength and the bare electron cyclotron energy. These results suggest that even when this ratio is finite, so the electrons are not projected into a single Landau level, there may be an emergent PH symmetry, which becomes asymptotically exact in the limit of low-frequency, long-wavelength and small deviation from half-filling. Our results show that for the properties we have analyzed, this is true at least to some nontrivial orders in frequency, momentum and deviation from half-filling.
    </para><para>
      Within the context of HLR theory, we find that a similar degree of PH symmetry should emerge in the vicinity of other fractions of the form , such as 1/4, 1/6, etc. As a practical matter, this is only of interest for small values of , since at least for the case of Coulomb interactions between the electrons, the ground state for values of  appears to be a Wigner crystal of electrons, rather than a liquid of composite fermions. Nevertheless, an emergent PH symmetry at  or  would be noteworthy, since there is no exact particle hole symmetry about fractions other than 1/2, even for electrons confined to a single Landau level.
    </para><para>
      The structure of the paper is the following. In the next Section we review the HLR approach to the half-filled Landau level. In Section  we address the issue of  transport at  in the presence of disorder, and show how the HLR approach yields results which are consistent with the requirements of particle-hole symmetry. In Section 
we address &#8220;commensurability oscillations&#8221;, which occur at fillings slightly away from , with a focus on the locations of minima in the dispersion curves for the lowest-energy magnetoroton excitations in fractional quantized Hall states near half filling. We show
how an analysis within the HLR approach yields results that are consistent with the requirements of particle-hole symmetry. In Section , we review the Son-Dirac approach, and make a comparison between results of that approach and our analyses based on HLR.
We conclude with a Summary section.

      <para>
        We consider a two-dimensional system of interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field, with a Landau level filling fraction  that is equal to or close to . We assume that the electrons are fully spin polarized, so we may neglect the spin degree of freedom. The Hamiltonian of the system may be written in the form
        
        where  is a two-body interaction of the form
        
        and  is the vector potential due to a uniform magnetic field  in the -direction.
In the case where  is a long-range potential, the Hamiltonian must include interactions between the electrons and a uniform neutralizing background, which we include in .
In the presence of impurities, we shall add a one-body potential  which depends on position; for the present, however, we shall consider a system without impurities, so we take .
Except where otherwise stated, we use units where the electron charge is positive and equal to unity, and .
      </para><para>
        The system under consideration has several important properties. First, it is Galilean invariant, so that it must obey Kohn&#8217;s theorem, which states that the response to a uniform time-varying electric field should be the same as for a system of non-interacting electrons in the given magnetic field. Second, as mentioned in the Introduction, in the limit where the electron mass  is taken to zero, so that the cyclotron energy becomes infinite while the electron-electron interaction is held fixed, the system should manifest an exact PH symmetry about Landau-level filling fraction . We shall see to what extent these properties are preserved by approximations that have been proposed for treating the system.

    <subsection title="the hlr hypothesis">
      <para>
        The fermion-Chern-Simons approach employed in HLR began with an exact unitary transformation, a singular gauge transformation, where the many-body electron wave function is multiplied by a phase factor that depends on the positions of all the electrons, such that the transformed Hamiltonian acquires a Chern-Simons gauge field , with  flux quanta attached to every electron. The transformed problem may be expressed in Lagrangian form by the following Lagrangian density:
        
        
        
        Taking the variation of the Lagrangian with respect to , we obtain the constraint
        
        In these equations,  is the Grassmann field for a set of transformed &#8220;composite fermions&#8221; (CFs), whose density  is identical to the electron density .
      </para><para>
        At this stage, we have merely transformed one insoluble problem to another. However, the transformed problem admits a sensible mean-field approximation, whereas the original problem did not. In particular, if the Landau level is half full, so that there is one electron for each quantum of electromagnetic flux, the mean field problem describes a set of non-interacting fermions in zero magnetic field. To go beyond mean-field theory, one must include the effects of fluctuations in the gauge field and fluctuations in the two-body potential. The central hypothesis of HLR is that, in principle, one could obtain the correct properties of the system by starting from the mean field solution, treating the omitted fluctuation terms via perturbation theory. This assumes that the interacting ground state can be reached from the mean-field solution by turning on the perturbing terms adiabatically, without encountering any phase transition. Among the consequences of this assumption are that the ground state at  should be compressible, and that there should be something like a Fermi surface, with a well-defined Fermi wave vector, .
      </para><para>
        Experimentally, in GaAs two-dimensional electron systems, it appears that the HLR hypothesis is correct for electrons in the lowest Landau level. However, it appears that the HLR hypothesis breaks down for electrons in the second Landau level, where one observes an incompressible fractional Hall state, with an energy gap, at half filling, in high quality samples. It is widely believed that this quantized Hall state may be understood as arising from an instability of the Fermi surface to formation of Cooper pairs in the second Landau level. In still higher Landau levels, it appears that the Fermi surface is unstable with respect to the formation of charge density waves, which can lead to a large anisotropy in the measured electrical resistivity at low temperatures.
      </para><para>
        If one is interested in dynamic properties, such as the response to a time-dependent and space-dependent electric field, the first level of approximation, beyond static mean field theory, is the random phase approximation (RPA), or time-dependent Hartree approximation. In this approximation, the composite fermions are treated as non-interacting fermions, with the bare mass , driven by an effective electromagnetic field which is the sum of the applied external electromagnetic field, the Hartree potential arising from the interaction , in the case where there are induced modulations in the self-consistent charge density, and induced electric and magnetic fields arising from modulations of the Chern Simons gauge field. These fields may be written as
        
        where  is the electron current density at the point in question.
      </para><para>
        As we shall discuss further below, many properties of the system near  are described properly by the RPA, including the response of the system to a uniform time-dependent electric field. However, use of the unrenormalized electron mass as assumed in the RPA, can lead to a serious error in the energy scale for various excitations. A proper low-energy description of the composite fermion liquid requires the use of an effective mass , which may be very different than the bare mass . In particular, one expects that the renormalized mass should be determined by the electron-electron interaction , and should be independent of , in the limit where  and the cyclotron energy goes to infinity. The renormalized mass enters directly in the low temperature specific heat, and it also is manifest in the magnitudes of the energy gaps at fractional quantized Hall states of the form , where  is a positive or negative integer, in the limit  or .
      </para><para>
        A simple modification of the RPA, which we denote RPA*, would consist of replacing  by  in the RPA. Although this would correctly give the energy scale for the specific heat and energy gaps in the fractional quantized Hall states, this would change the response to a time-dependent uniform electric field, which was correctly given in RPA. Specifically, if we write
, at frequency , then it is required by Kohn&#8217;s theorem that the resistivity tensor should be given by
        
        where  is the unit antisymmetric tensor, .
Using RPA*, one would find, incorrectly, that  is replaced by  in the formula for .
      </para><para>
        This defect in RPA* is familiar from the theory of ordinary Fermi liquids. In order to get the correct low-frequency response functions in the presence of a renormalized effective mass, it is necessary to include effects of the Landau interaction parameters . These may be defined by the energy cost to form a distortion of the Fermi surface. Specifically, a small distortion of the form
        
        will have an energy cost
        
        where .
For a Galilean invariant system, we must have
        
        As noted in SH , inclusion of these interaction parameters will also restore the correct response for the composite fermion system at . In the presence of a non-zero current, the  parameters lead to an extra force on the electrons, which restores  to  in the resistivity tensor ().
      </para><para>
        We remark that it is also necessary to take into account a Landau interaction parameter if one wishes to obtain the correct value for the electron compressibility. As in a normal Fermi liquid, we have
        
        where  is the chemical potential (defined to exclude the contribution of the macroscopic electrostatic potential).

    <subsection title="infrared divergences">
      <para>
        As was already observed in HLR, in the case of Coulomb interactions, which behave as  for large separations , an analysis of contributions to the effective mass  arising from long-wavelength fluctuations of the Chern-Simons gauge field predicts a logarithmic divergence in  as one approaches the Fermi surface. A similar divergence is found in the Landau interaction parameters, however, so that Galilean invariance is preserved, and the compressibility remains finite. The decay rate for quasiparticles close to the Fermi energy is predicted to be small compared to the quasiparticle energy, in this case, so that the quasiparticle excitations remain well-defined, and the composite Fermion system may be described as a &#8220;marginal Fermi liquid.&#8221; Similar infrared divergences are found in the Son-Dirac theory of the half-filled Landau level.
      </para><para>
        It is believed that these infrared divergences will be absent, and  will remain finite, if one assumes an electron-electron interaction that falls off more slowly than , so that long-wavelength density fluctuations in the electron density are suppressed. Moreover, these divergences are irrelevant to the issues of PH symmetry which are the focus of the current investigation.
Consequently, we shall assume, for the purposes of our discussion, that we are dealing with an electron-electron interaction that falls of more slowly than  and that  is finite.
      </para><para>
        We remark that for short-range electron-electron interactions, fluctuations in the gauge field lead to divergences that are stronger than logarithmic, and long-lived quasiparticles can no longer be defined at the Fermi surface. Nevertheless, it is believed that many predictions of the HLR theory remain valid in this case.
We expect that the results of the present paper with regard to particle hole symmetry should also apply in the case of short-range interactions, but we have not investigated this case in detail.

    <subsection title="energy gaps at">
      <para>
        According to the HLR picture, if there is a finite effective mass  at , then for fractional quantized Hall states of the form , where  is a positive or negative integer, the energy gaps, in the limit , should have the asymptotic form
        
        where  the deviation from the magnetic field at  for the given electron density, i.e.,
        
        Note that the allowed values of  are symmetric about ,
assuming that the electron density is varied while  is held fixed, since
.
      </para><para>
        In the limit , PH symmetry requires that the energy gap should be the same for  and , assuming that  has been held fixed.
Equation () will satisfy this requirement, at least to first order order in . Symmetry beyond first order depends on the choice of
 used in the formula. Although the HLR analysis specifies that  should be evaluated under the condition of , there is still an ambiguity when , because one must decide whether to use the value appropriate for the given magnetic field or for the given electron density.
These conditions are precisely equivalent to each other only when . If one employs in
Eq.&#160;() the value of  calculated at the given value of , then the formula will exhibit PH symmetry to all orders in . If one were to use the value of  calculated at the given value of , however, there would be violations of PH symmetry at second order in .
      </para><para>
        In practice, the value of the renormalized mass cannot be calculated entirely within the HLR approach, so the value of  to be used in the effective theory must be obtained from experiment or from some other microscopic calculation. Thus we can say that the HLR theory is compatible with PH symmetry in the fractional quantized Hall energy gaps, but it can only be deduced from the theory to first order in . We remark that the same situation occurs in the Son-Dirac theory. Precise PH symmetry in that case depends on a separate assumption that the renormalized value of the Dirac velocity should be determined by the magnetic field and not by the electron density.

      PH symmetry, in the limit , implies that the Hall conductivity in response to a spatially uniform electric field should be precisely given by
      
      regardless of the applied frequency. This should be true even in the presence of impurities, provided that the disorder potential  is PH symmetric in a statistical sense. This means that if one chooses the uniform background potential such that the average , then all odd moments of the disorder potential must vanish.

      In the absence of impurities, we may use the result () for a Galilean invariant system to calculate the conductivity tensor

 interaction parameter is taken into account. However, if one were to use the renormalized mass without the  interaction, one would find that  is replaced by  in Eq. (), so that particle hole symmetry would not be satisfied for .

      Of greater interest is the dc Hall conductivity in the presence of impurities. For many years, beginning with the work of Kivelson et al. in 1997, it has been widely believed that the HLR approach must give
a result for the  Hall conductivity that is inconsistent with PH symmetry, at least at the level of RPA and perhaps beyond, if the mean free path for composite fermions is finite. The reasoning goes as follows. Within the HLR approach, the electron resistivity tensor is related to the resistivity tensor of the composite fermions by
      
      where  is the Chern-Simons resistivity tensor, given by
      
      One finds that in order to obtain the PH symmetric result for , if , it is necessary that  However, it was argued that  is necessarily equal to zero at . This is because, in the absence of impurities, the composite fermions see an average effective magnetic field equal to zero, which is effectively invariant under time reversal. The presence of impurities leads to non-uniformities in the electron density, which lead to local fluctuations in the effective magnetic field . These fluctuations, in turn, will be the dominant source of scattering of composite fermions, under conditions where the correlation length for the impurity potential is large compared to the Fermi wave length. If the impurity potential is statistically PH symmetric, then there will be equal probability to have a positive or negative value of  at any point, so that the resulting perturbation to the composite fermions should again be invariant under time reversal in a statistical sense.
    </para><para>
      The fallacy we find here in this reasoning is that fluctuations in  are correlated with fluctuations in the electrostatic potential, which though their effects are weak compared to the effects of , are sufficient to break the statistical time-reversal symmetry produced by the  fluctuations alone. We shall see below that when these correlated fluctuations are taken into account we recover precisely the result
 required by PH symmetry.

      In the subsections below, we show how disorder leads to the desired result for
. As there are some subtleties involved in these calculations, we present here two different derivations, which bring different insights to the problem and which may be applicable in somewhat different regimes. The first derivation employs a semi-classical analysis and
uses the Kubo formula, which expresses the conductivity in terms of equilibrium correlation functions. The second derivation employs the Born Approximation and the Boltzmann Equation , and calculates the conductivity by analyzing the effect of the electric field on the particles&#8217; dynamics. We also discuss consequences for thermoelectric transport at .

      Our calculations are restricted to the case where the Fourier components of the disorder potential have wave vectors small compared to . Neither the HLR nor the Dirac theories, in their simplest forms, can describe quantitatively the effect of potential fluctuations with wave vectors comparable to or larger than . In either theory, the coupling between a short-wavelength potential fluctuation and the operators that scatter a composite fermion from one point to another on the Fermi surface will be affected by vertex corrections,
whose value is determined by microscopic considerations and cannot be calculated within the low-energy theory itself.

      It should be emphasized that while the effects discussed below may be important as a matter of principle, they are all sub-leading corrections to the transport in the presence of impurities. For small impurity concentrations, the CF Hall conductance  is small compared to the diagonal CF conductance, , which is proportional to , where  is the transport mean free path for composite fermions.
Conversely, if one were to set , this would lead to a deviation of the electronic  from the PH-symmetric value by an amount proportional to , which is small compared to  as well as to , in the limit of large .

        In general, density fluctuations produced by an external electrostatic potential such as  will tend to screen the external potential and give rise to a combined self-consistent potential, which we denote . Within a mean-field approximation, for long-wavelength potential fluctuations, the induced density fluctuation should be related to  by

 has the same probability distribution as .
For example, from Eqn (),  vanishes under time-averaging.
More specifically, since the distribution of  is invariant under , so too is that of  under , such that () is real.
Hence, from ()

      <para>
        It seems reasonable that we are justified in using a semiclassical approximation for our problem, because we are necessarily focused on potential fluctuations on a length scale  that is large compared to . However, the requirement also that the classical scattering angle exceeds the diffraction angle, [i.e., the condition  discussed above], leads to some subtleties in the applicability of the classical results for weak potentials.
It can be shown that the transport scattering cross section, (i.e., the integrated cross section weighted by the square of the momentum transfer) is correctly given by the semiclassical approximation in this case, and it agrees with a quantum mechanical calculation based on the Born approximation. However, the total scattering cross section, as well as the differential cross section at any particular angle, is generally not given correctly by a semiclassical analysis. Therefore, it seems useful to check that our semiclassical calculation of the off-diagonal part of the CF conductivity tensor can be duplicated in a more quantum mechanical calculation.

        Here we follow closely the analysis used by Nozi&#232;res and Lewiner (NL) for the anomalous Hall effect due to spin-orbit interactions in a spin-polarized semiconductor. In their analysis, NL employed a Boltzmann equation to study the evolution of the electron system in a uniform applied electric field, paying careful attention to the effects of spin orbit coupling on the collision integral in the presence of the field.

        In our case, we wish to study carefully the scattering of a composite fermion by an impurity described by an effective Hamiltonian of the form (). In order to use the NL analysis directly, we must impose the condition that the scattering matrix element  due to a single impurity is zero in the limit . This means that the associated potential  should vanish for  faster than . In real space, this means that the space integral of the potential  should vanish, as well as its first spatial moments. If individual impurities do not satisfy these conditions, the NL analysis may still be used if impurities can be grouped into small clusters that satisfy the conditions. In any case, the purpose of this subsection is to provide a check of the validity of the above-described semiclassical approximation as a matter of principle, rather than to check the validity in a realistic situation.

        It is instructive to describe our calculation in two parts. In the first part we consider the scattering of a single composite fermion from momentum  to momentum  by the potential () in the absence of an electric field. We show - following NL - that this scattering involves a &#8220;side-jump&#8221; , i.e., a motion of the electron in the direction perpendicular to the momentum transferred from the disordered potential to the composite fermion. When averaged over all scattering processes from a momentum  each scattering event involves a side-jump,
which
results in a net motion perpendicular to the direction of . In the presence of an electric field , the net flux of electrons that experience scattering by the potential is proportional to , where  is the transport scattering time. As they scatter from impurities, the extra electrons acquire a velocity in the -direction given by  where  is the
cumulative side jump during the time  in which their direction of motion is randomized. Since  is of order , this results in a
current in the -direction of the order of , which gives rise to a non-zero contribution to  that is independent of the mean free path.
      </para><para>
        In the second part we consider the effect of an applied electric field on the scattering. In the presence of that field the change in position associated with the side-jump implies that the scattering of the composite fermion involves also a change in its kinetic energy. As explained below, that change results in another contribution to the Hall current, equal in magnitude and sign to the first contribution. Throughout this subsection, we assume , and return to units where .

          For the first part, suppose that a composite fermion, described by a Gaussian wave packet, centered at a momentum  on the Fermi surface, is incident on the impurity. As discussed in Appendix B of NL, we may write the wave function of the CF as
          
          
          where  describes the incident wave:
          
          where  is the energy of a fermion of wave vector , and  is a normalization constant, and  and  are of order  and  respectively. (Note that the incident wave packet is centered at the origin at time .) In the limit of large positive times one finds that

          As noted in NL, the average position of the particle at time  can be written as
          
          where
          
          There are two contributions to the shift of the average position. The first is seen when we consider a momentum  in the scattered wave, with , so that . Then, to lowest order,  may be replaced by , and the phase is equal to the phase of . Using () for , we find that  has an extra argument, beyond the contribution from , arising from the complex value of . This extra argument has the form
,
and it leads to an extra displacement of the center of the scattered wave packet by an amount
          
          The second contribution to the average displacement comes from weight that has been asymmetrically removed from the incident part of the wave packet, where  is close to . Here there is an interference between  and . If one assumes that  is vanishing for , then one finds that the contribution from this term is given by
          
          Summing the two contributions we find that the net displacement (&#8220;side jump&#8221;) associated with a particle that scatters from a direction  into direction  depends on the transferred momentum, and is given by
          
          This side jump contributes directly to the total current through a net charge displacement per unit time
          
          where  is the occupation probability for a state of momentum , and  is the transition probability [see Eq.&#160;() below]. We can express the side-jump contribution  in terms of the current in the absence of that contribution, . Using Eq.&#160;() for the displacement, and noticing that the transport scattering rate is given by
          
          we can simplify Eq.&#160;() to
          
          Since, to leading order, , the  term leads to a contribution to  of the form

      <subsubsection title="scattering rate in a composite fermion liquid in the presence of an electric field">
        <para>
          Eq. () is half of the amount we need for PH symmetry.
The second half is a consequence of having a liquid of composite fermions, in which an applied electric field affects the occupation of momentum states. While the scattering rate from momentum  to momentum  is symmetric with respect to the sign of  for a single composite fermion in the absence of an electric field, the situation is more complicated in the presence of both a liquid of composite fermions and an electric field.
In that case, due to the electric field the side-jump is associated with a change of the composite fermion&#8217;s kinetic energy by an amount .
The effect of this change of energy on the transport is best understood by means of the Boltzmann equation. For  transport in the presence of impurities the equation reads
          
          where
          
          Here  is the Fermi-Dirac distribution,  is the force acting on the composite fermions,  is the energy, and  is the disordered potential. The -function expresses the change of the kinetic energy incurred by the scattered electron, a change which is our main focus here.

          As this expression shows, in the limit of a small scattering rate  the shift of the Fermi sea that results from the application of the electric field is primarily parallel to the electric field, but includes also a small term perpendicular to the field.

          Although observations of thermal effects require that the temperature should not be too small, the calculations here also assume that the temperature should not be too high.

          We see that the thermopower tensor
has non-zero off-diagonal elements, since  is not diagonal. This contrasts with predictions based on a naive application of the HLR theory, pointed out by , in which the off-diagonal thermopower vanishes. It recovers the central result of their PH symmetric theory.

          In a thermal transport experiment, one seeks to measure the heat current  induced by a temperature gradient , under conditions where the electrical current is zero. As shown in Ref.&#160;,
the diagonal thermal conductivity  at  should be related by the Wiedemann-Franz law to the conductivity of the composite fermions, that is
          
          This result is obtained in both the HLR theory and the Dirac theory. Note that the thermal conductivity will become large as the mean free path becomes large, while the diagonal electrical conductivity
 approaches zero in this limit.

          However, in an actual experiment in a strong magnetic field, one expects that thermal gradients and currents will be quite inhomogeneous, and a major part of the thermal Hall current will be associated with chiral heat flow near the sample boundaries, where particle-hole symmetry is strongly broken. Moreover, the transverse heat flow will be small compared to the longitudinal heat current, if the disorder scattering is weak. A proper analysis of the transverse heat flow is, therefore, a non-trivial problem, which we shall not address here.

      An important property investigated in HLR, which turns out to be sensitive to PH symmetry, was the wavevector dependent longitudinal conductivity, , for a wave vector  in the -direction, in the limit of frequency . Precisely at , In the absence of impurities, it was found, using the RPA that
      
      independent of the renormalized mass or the bare mass. Subsequent analyses supported the idea that this result should be correct to all orders in perturbation theory, even in the case of short range electron-electron interactions or of  interactions, where the effective mass is found to diverge at the Fermi energy. In the presence of disorder, it was predicted that Eq () should hold for ,

      The non-trivial -dependence of  results from an inverse -dependence of the transverse conductivity for composite fermions, which is non-local, because at , the composite fermions can travel in straight lines for distances of the order of , which can be very large compared to the inter-particle distance . For filling factors that differ slightly from , the composite fermions will no longer travel in straight lines, but rather should follow cyclotron orbits with an effective cyclotron radius given by
      
      One would expect, therefore, that the conductivity should become independent of  for wavelengths large compared to , or  Analysis at the RPA level, using a semiclassical description of the composite fermion trajectories, found that the value of the conductivity in this regime is essentially the same as the  conductivity at . By contrast, in the regime , if , one finds that the longitudinal conductivity depends on  and , and is a non-monotonic function of these variables. If either  or  is varied, one finds a series of maxima and minima, with the maxima occurring roughly at points which satisfy Eq. (), or equivalently

      Another type of commensurability oscillation, commonly referred to as Weiss oscillations, may be observed by measuring the dc resistivity in the presence of a periodic electrostatic potential, which may be imposed by a periodic array of gates or etched defects on the surface.

      In the following subsections, we shall examine a third type of commensurability oscillation related to the existence of local minima in the spectrum  of so-called magnetoroton excitations in a fractional quantized Hall state with  close to 1/2. Magnetorotons may be understood as bound states of a quasiparticle in the lowest empty composite-Fermion Landau level and a quasihole in the highest filled level. As was discussed by Simon and Halperin, the spectrum should have a series of minima, at wave vectors given approximately by Eq. (), which become increasingly sharp for small values of . The frequencies  are manifest as poles in the response function to an applied electric field at frequency  and wave vector . For certain filling fractions the magnetoroton minima have been numerically calculated using composite fermion trial wave functions.

      Although the magnetoroton spectrum may be difficult to measure experimentally in the region of interest to usHowever, the magnetoroton spectrum has been successfully measured at filling fractions ,  and  by Kukushkin et al.., it has a big advantage from a theoretical point of view compared to predictions for the magnetoresistance in a periodic potential or the zero-frequency longitudinal conductance. The last two quantities are well defined only in the presence of a small but finite density of impurities. However, the behavior of a partially full composite-fermion Landau level in the presence of weak impurity scattering may be quite complicated, and is certainly not well understood.
By contrast, the magnetoroton spectrum may be studied in system without impurities, in a fractional quantized Hall state where there is an energy gap and where the magnetoroton may be precisely defined, as the lowest energy excitation for the given value of . We shall comment briefly on our understanding of the Weiss oscillations at the end of this section.

          First we consider Fermi-liquid corrections including mass renormalization and the residual Landau interaction. To incorporate mass renormalization we simply replace  by . This leads to a violation of Kohn&#8217;s theorem and the -sum rule, which has to be compensated by introducing the proper Landau interaction parameter . The Landau parameter leads to another contribution to the diagonal components of the composite fermion resistivity tensor, , which is of order  in the regime we consider.

          We can also consider corrections to the semiclassical expression of  in Eq.&#160;(), for example from the full quantum-mechanical summation in Appendix A of SH.
Since we expect the semiclassical expression to be justified in the large  limit (which has been explicitly demonstrated recently in ), the corrections should be formally higher order in . In principle several leading order corrections are possible:
          
          where other types of corrections are either higher order in  (taking into account ), or forbidden by general constraints. These constraints include  being odd under  when fixing , and  being odd under  when fixing . Both constraints are closely related to the symmetry of the conductivity matrix elements under a change of the sign of the frequency.
These terms would give rise to corrections to the dispersion curve in Eq.&#160;(), which would lead to corrections of the locations of the dispersion minima, so that

          These corrections beyond the semiclassical approximation could indeed shift the momenta of the magneto-roton minima at order . However, this correction would be symmetric in  (at order ), so particle-hole symmetry is still preserved at this order.

          The correction terms in () will also lead to a correction of the frequencies at the minima:

Along with our previous result that in the presence of PH-symmetric disorder, the Hall conductance at  is fixed at , at least through second order in the impurity scattering rate, this suggests that there is a type of emergent particle-hole symmetry near all these even-denominator fillings.
      </para><para>
        Interestingly, a similar type of emergent particle-hole symmetry was found also when the energy gaps  of fractional quantum Hall states at filling factors close to  were calculated for electrons interacting through the Coulomb interaction. The energy gap, in this case, is predicted to have the form 
        
        which reduces to Eq.&#160;() for .
This expression is predicted to be exact in the limit of large , and the leading logarithmic term is independent of the bare mass of the electron electron. Moreover, the result is symmetric in , at least to lowest order. However, the possibility of asymmetric corrections at second order in  was not investigated.

        As remarked above, a proper analysis of the experiments measuring the resistivity in the presence of an imposed periodic potential with wave vector  would require a careful analysis of the effects of impurity scattering at filling factors away from , which is beyond the scope of the current paper.
However, one can gain insight into the problem from a very recent investigation by Cheung,
Raghu and Mulligan ( and private communications). They have calculated the change in resistivity  produced by a weak modulating potential in an approximation where they treat impurities in a simple relaxation approximation,
where the relaxation rate is take to be a constant, independent of  and the scattering wave vector, etc. Although the bulk of their paper is based on the Son-Dirac model, they also present results based on the HLR equations.
      </para><para>
        Treating the ratio  as a free parameter, where  is the residual screened electric potential produced by the external periodic potential and  is the induced Chern-Simons magnetic field seen by the composite fermions, they find a series of curves for the induced magnetoresistance, as a function of  whose shapes depend on . When , they find that the HLR prediction coincides precisely with the Dirac prediction and is properly symmetric in , when the density is varied while  is held fixed. In particular, when , it is predicted that there will be minima in
 at magnetic fields that satisfy
        
        According to the discussion in Subsection  of the present paper, leading to Eq.&#160;(), the value  is indeed the proper choice for that parameter. (We note that the Weiss oscillations are measured at a temperature  that is larger than the energy scale , so that the electron compressibility may be taken to be the same as at .)
      </para><para>
        The fact that one must take into account modulations in the Chern-Simons scalar potential as well as in the Chern-Simons magnetic field, in order to understand in a quantitative way the effects of an imposed periodic potential on the electrical resistivity, was previously emphasized by Zwerschke and Gerhardts . Also, a correct formula for the magnetoresistance in the presence of modulations in both the screened electrostatic potential and the effective magnetic field  was contained in Ref.&#160; by Barkeshli, Mulligan, and Fisher. In that paper, however, authors then ignored the electrostatic potential on the grounds that its effects would be small compared to the effect of , so they did not obtain the small correction necessary to restore the PH symmetry.
      </para><para>
        Although the resistance minima observed experimentally in Ref.&#160; do obey particle-hole symmetry, the actual positions deviate (symmetrically) from the values predicted by Eq.&#160;(), by amounts of order . We do not know whether these deviations could be explained by a theory that includes the effects of impurity scattering in a more accurate way.
      </para><para>
        It should be emphasized that theoretical discussions about presence or absence of particle-hole symmetry generally refer to a situation where  is varied while  is held constant. In experiments, however, it is most common to vary  while  is held constant. In that mode of operation, features that occur at positions we consider symmetric, such as those given by Eq. (), will appear asymmetric in the data, by amounts of order . By contrast, the values of  given by the naive HLR theory, where modulations in the Chern-Simons scalar potential are ignored, would appear symmetric
about  in the data.

    <subsection title="ambiguity of">
      <para>
        The question of what determines the Fermi momentum  of composite fermions, away from half-filling, has played a significant role in the literature. Naively, there are three possible answers depending on which theory one uses: in HLR theory the Fermi volume is given by the particle density, in anti-HLR it is given by the hole density, and in Son-Dirac it is given by the half of the flux density. These answers are identical at , but deviate from one another away from half-filling. However, one should be more careful when addressing this issue.
      </para><para>
        There are two sources of confusion regarding . First,  of the composite fermions is not a sharply defined quantity away from half-filling, since the composite fermions move in a nonzero effective magnetic field  and do not have a sharp Fermi surface. The ambiguity in the definition of , set by the inverse effective cyclotron radius, is of order . The differences in  determined from electron, hole or flux densities are also of this order, so the three answers are identical within this intrinsic ambiguity.
      </para><para>
        A subtler point is that  itself is not a measurable quantity, especially away from . What can be measured in commensurability oscillation experiments are the commensurability momenta . Past work has inferred  from  via Eq.&#160;(). However, the simple relation Eq.&#160;() is valid only to leading order in . Once we go to higher order in , which is necessary to differentiate particle-density from hole-density, the simple relation Eq.&#160;() no longer holds and a more careful calculation is needed. This is exactly what we did in the earlier parts of this Section. Our results show that the commensurability momenta are indeed particle-hole symmetric, even though in HLR theory , which is not an observable by itself, appears to be formally PH asymmetric.

      The Son-Dirac model may be defined by Lagrangian density of the form
      
      
      where  is a two-component Grassmann spinor,  is the external magnetic field,  are the Pauli spin matrices, and  is a term which represents the two-body interaction . The velocity  is an input parameter, like the effective mass  in the HLR theory, which must be taken either from experiment or from an independent microscopic calculation. We shall be interested in a situation in which the Fermi level is inside the band of positive energy fermion states. The lower Dirac band is integrated out, which produces the  term.
    </para><para>
      The Son-Dirac Lagrangian becomes explicitly PH symmetric if one takes the limit . In this limit, the contribution of the  term is precisely canceled by the contribution from the Berry curvature, which is completely concentrated at the bottom of the occupied states in the positive energy Dirac band. Then, the Lagrangian may be replaced by a form in which  is precisely zero and the  term is simply omitted; i.e., there is no longer a Chern-Simons term in the action for the gauge field  In the following discussion, we confine ourselves to the case =0, except where otherwise specified.
    </para><para>
      In the Son-Dirac formulation, the composite fermions see an effective magnetic field  which is related to the electron density and the applied magnetic field in the same way as in HLR:
      
      However, the electron density and the composite fermion density are no longer identical. Rather, the density of Dirac composite fermions is tied to the (local) value of the magnetic field
      
      Similarly, the current of the Dirac fermions is related to the local electric field by
      
      while the effective electric field felt by the Dirac fermions is given by
      
      The electrical conductivity tensor, for a long-wavelength electric field is then given by
      
      where  is the resistivity tensor of the Dirac fermions, and
      
    </para><para>
      As in the HLR theory the presence of potential disorder will cause fluctuations in electron density, which will lead to fluctuations in the effective field  proportional to the self-consistent electric potential . Potential fluctuations do not lead to fluctuations in  or in the effective electric field . Therefore, if the potential fluctuations are statistically PH symmetric, so that all odd moments of  are zero, the Dirac fermions will see a field that is statistically time-reversal symmetric, and  will be purely diagonal. Therefore, we recover  as required by particle hole symmetry.
    </para><para>
      At a finite frequency , in the absence of impurities, in the RPA, the resistivity tensor for Dirac fermions is readily calculated to be
      
      where . As this is purely diagonal, the ac Hall conductivity remains fixed at the value required by PH symmetry. However, the diagonal conductivity  predicted by () does not agree with the result , which is required by Kohn&#8217;s theorem in the limit where the electron mass , and electrons are restricted to the lowest Landau level. As remarked above, this can be corrected, beyond the RPA, by including the effects of Landau interaction parameters
.
    </para><para>
      Using the Son-Dirac Lagrangian for , one predicts that fractional quantized Hall states should occur when
      
      where  is half of an odd integer, either positive or negative. This condition is obviously PH symmetric and it is equivalent to the HLR prediction, with the identification . The shift in the choice of indexing reflects the presence of a Berry phase of  for the Dirac fermions at the Fermi energy. The energy gaps in the quantized Hall states are given, within RPA by Eq. () with  replaced by . As remarked previously, the gaps will obey PH symmetry provided that the velocity  is assumed to depend on the magnetic field, and not on the electron density, or more generally, if  is assumed to be an even function of .
    </para><para>
      According to PH symmetry, the magneto-exciton spectra should also be independent of the sign of . The positions of the magnetoroton minima may be found, to lowest order in , by
tracking the dispersion of poles in the electrical conductivity , as was done in Subsection  above in the HLR picture. Taking into account Eq.&#160;(), we see that within the Dirac description, poles in  coincide with the occurrence of a zero in the determinant of the composite fermion conductivity tensor . Within the semiclassical approximation, these zeros occur at , if
      
      These values are clearly PH symmetric and are identical to the results obtained using HLR in Subsection
, through order . This result for Dirac composite fermions was also obtained in , to lowest order in , with careful attention to interaction effects.
    </para><para>
      As in the HLR case, the actual locations of the magnetoroton minima in the Dirac theory will be shifted from these values (by amounts small compared to ), and the frequency values will be shifted from zero, due to interaction effects and to corrections to the semiclassical theory, but
all such shifts should be symmetric in .
    </para><para>
      Finally, we discuss properties of the Dirac Lagrangian () in the case where the Dirac mass  is not set equal to zero, so the theory is not explicitly PH symmetric. As was observed by Son, in the non-relativistic limit, where , the Dirac action reduces precisely to the HLR action
(), after a redefinition of the gauge field, (). As we have seen, the HLR theory and the massless Dirac theory give identical results for long-wavelength low-energy properties in the limit of , so that PH symmetry reappears in this case. We find that there is a similar emergent PH symmetry for intermediate values of . Since the Lagrangian for the Dirac theory with finite  includes a Chern-Simons term identical to that in the HLR theory, the relations between the composite fermion and the electronic response functions are identical in the two theories. The semiclassical theory for the minima of the magnetoroton spectra take the same form as we found in Section  above, which implies that the spectrum is, again, symmetric in , at least through order .
Similarly, we find that the Hall conductance in the presence of impurities at  is fixed at , at least through order , under the same conditions that we assumed in the analysis of HLR in Section .
    </para><para>
      An apparent difference between HLR and a Dirac theory with finite  is that in the latter case the fermions near the Fermi energy have a non-zero Berry curvature. This Berry curvature is the same as that which results from spin-orbit coupling in a semiconductor,
which, as we have remarked, is responsible for side-jump contributions to the anomalous Hall effect in semiconductor models. However, in the limit of scattering wavevectors  much smaller than , which we have assumed in our analysis, the matrix element for the spin-orbit term is negligible compared to that from the screened impurity potential  or the effective magnetic field fluctuation . Scattering from potential fluctuations with  of order  would depend on renormalized matrix elements whose values are beyond the scope of an effective theory.
    </para><para>
      In the Dirac theory with finite , fermions at the Fermi energy will have a Berry phase which is neither zero nor . In contrast with the Berry curvature, the total Berry phase has no direct effect on the dc Hall conductivity in the presence of impurities, but it does affect the ac Hall conductivity. Just as in HLR, the finite frequency Hall conductivity will deviate from  at order , unless the effect is counteracted by a non-zero Fermi-liquid interaction parameter, whose actual value will depend on details of the original microscopic theory.

  <section title="conclusions">
    <para>
      We have seen that in the limit of long wavelengths and low frequencies, with  close to 1/2, and in the limit of small disorder potential, the Son-Dirac and HLR theories make identical physical predictions for several key properties, provided that the HLR theory is properly evaluated. Both theories give results for these properties that are consistent with PH symmetry, even at the RPA level. In the Dirac theory, PH symmetry is put in by hand, at the outset, by setting the Dirac mass  equal to zero. In the HLR theory, PH symmetry seems to emerge, asymptotically, in this limit, even though it is not put in at the beginning. Moreover, the PH symmetry seems to emerge even if the bare mass  is not taken to zero, which would be the condition for electrons to be confined to a single Landau level, where PH symmetry would be exact.
    </para><para>
      In order to get the correct energy scale for the specific heat or for energy gaps in fractional quantized Hall states close to , at the RPA level, the bare mass  in HLR must be replaced by a renormalized mass , whose value cannot be obtained within the theory itself. Similarly in the massless Dirac theory, one must use a renormalized value of the Fermi velocity . After these substitutions are made, however, neither the Dirac theory nor the HLR theory will give the correct response functions to perturbations at a finite frequency, unless one also includes the effects of the Landau interaction parameters , for . In the HLR theory, this correction gives the correct frequency response, dictated by the Galilean invariance of the original model. In the limit , this leads to a conductivity tensor
 for a spatially uniform electric field that is independent of  and which, therefore, satisfies the requirement that  should be independent of frequency by PH symmetry, for electrons confined to the lowest Landau level. If the Landau interaction were omitted, however, an RPA calculation with the renormalized mass would incorrectly give a frequency-dependence to , which would result in a non-zero correction to  at order .
    </para><para>
      In the Dirac theory, for , one obtains correctly  at all frequencies, even at the simple RPA level, because of the explicit built in PH symmetry. However, the diagonal conductance  will be incorrect at order , unless one includes the Landau interaction correction.
    </para><para>
      We have also investigated the positions of minima in the dispersion curve for magnetorotons, at quantized Hall states of the form , in the limit of large , in the absence of impurity scattering. The minima of interest to us occur at wave vectors  that are small compared to , and at frequencies that are small compared to the energy gap , where  is the deviation of the magnetic field  from the value corresponding to , at the given electron density. Therefore, the positions of these minima are properly a subject for investigation in a theory that is supposed to be valid in the limit of long wavelengths and low frequencies. We have found that the HLR and Dirac theories give identical values for the location of these minima, consistent with PH symmetry, at least to order .
    </para><para>
      It is more difficult to compare predictions of the two theories for correlation functions or response functions at a wave vector  that is not small compared to , even if the frequency is arbitrarily small. An important example is the correlation function studied by Geraedts et al.. The authors introduce an operator  which is proportional to , projected to the lowest Landau level, and they study the correlation function for the Fourier transform, , for  close to . According to the Dirac theory, this correlation function should have no observable singularity at , because  is even under PH inversion, and fluctuations in such quantifies should not give rise to backscattering across the Fermi surface at . Geraedts et al. have studied this correlation function numerically, for electrons confined to the lowest Landau level at half filling, using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, and have found the singularity to be missing, as predicted. By contrast, they do observe a singularity at , as expected, in the density correlation function .
    </para><para>
      There does not seem to be any obvious reason in HLR theory why  should be immune from a singularity at , even if one imposes the requirement of particle-hole symmetry. However,
in order to actually calculate this response function in the HLR theory, one would have to know the correct form of the renormalized vertex that couples  to the composite fermions at . It is certainly possible that this quantity will vanish when , but at present, we do not have an argument to that effect. Thus, we cannot say that HLR and the Dirac theories make identical predictions for this property, but we can say that there is not a necessary contradiction between the two theories, in so far as the relevant vertices are unknown.
    </para><para>
      The HLR and Dirac theories can both be extended to describe a situation where the Fermi surface turns out to be unstable to formation of Cooper pairs, with the result that the actual ground state is an incompressible fractional quantized Hall state, with an energy gap. As Son has observed, pairing in the Dirac theory must occur in a channel with even angular momentum, because of the Berry phase associated with the Dirac composite fermions. The three most obvious channels for pairing are then , , and . The symmetries of the  and  state coincide, respectively, with the of the well-known &#8220;Pfaffian&#8221; and &#8220;anti-Pfaffian&#8221; states, which are related to each other by PH conjugation. The Dirac theory predicts that these two states should have identical energies, as is indeed required by PH symmetry, in the limit where electrons there are confined to a single Landau level, and there are only two-body interactions among them. Within the HLR theory, the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states would be described by pairing in
the channels  and  respectively. There is no obvious reason, within the theory, why these two states should have the same energy. However, such a coincidence is perfectly compatible with the theory; it means that for a PH symmetric system, the pairing interaction must be the same in the  and  channels. Pairing in the  channel of the Dirac model would lead to a new PH symmetric quantized Hall state, which Son named the PH-Pfaffian. Such a state would be described in HLR by pairing in the channel . There does not seem to be any numerical evidence that such a state would actually be the ground state of any quantum Hall system with realistic parameters. Wang and Chakravarty argued that within a particular approximation scheme, the  pairing appears to be unfavorable in Dirac composite fermi liquid. However, Zucker and Feldman have suggested that the PH-Pfaffian state seems compatible with existing experiments, and the state could have been stabilized by disorder and Landau-level mixing.
(The PH-Pfaffian is equivalent to the &#8220;T-Pfaffian&#8221; state, which was proposed, independently, in the context of surface states of topological superconductors.)
    </para><para>
      In summary, we have found no contradictions between physical predictions of the HLR and Son-Dirac theories for the low-energy properties of a half-filled Landau level. We find that the HLR approach is quite compatible with the existence of particle-hole symmetry, which is required in the case where the bare electron mass is taken to zero. For some properties this symmetry emerges automatically from the HLR theory, while in other cases it may be necessary to properly specify the value of parameters such as the Landau interactions strengths or a renormalized finite-momentum vertex. These results are all consistent with the point of view that the physics described by the particle-hole symmetric Son-Dirac theory is in fact a special case of the HLR theory.
    </para><para>
      As this manuscript was nearing completion, however, we became aware of recent work by M. Levin and D. T. Son, which asserts that the HLR approach is not able to obtain the correct value for the Hall viscosity at , in the PH symmetric limit. The Hall viscosity is reflected in a correction to the Hall conductance at non-zero wavevector q, which appears in the limit  and , with . Although the Hall viscosity may be very difficult to measure experimentally, this suggests that there are theoretical problems that need to be resolved before we can determine the precise relation between the HLR and Son-Dirac theories. Therefore it is still possible that the two theories may eventually be physically distinct, in which case the difference in their measurable behaviors would be much subtler than previously believed. Of course, even if both theories agree, it remains possible that neither one is correct in all respects.
