  <title>Localization Regions of Local Observables 
  </title><abstract>
     Exploiting the properties of the Jost-Lehmann-Dyson representation, it
is shown that in 1+2 or more spacetime dimensions, a nonempty smallest
localization region can be associated with each local observable
(except for the c-numbers) in a theory of local observables in the
sense of Araki, Haag, and Kastler. Necessary and sufficient
conditions are given that observables with spacelike separated localization
regions commute (locality of the net alone does not imply this yet). 
  </abstract><section title="Introduction">
       The algebraic approach to relativistic quantum physics  
aims at joining the structures familiar from nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics to those of special relativity. The object of investigation
is a net   of  local observables  that associates with every
bounded open region   that associates with every
bounded open region   in the Minkowski spacetime   a unital
C -algebra   of bounded operators in a Hilbert space  
in such a way that   implies
  ( isotony ), and such that the elements of
algebras associated with spacelike separated regions commute ( ), and such that the elements of
algebras associated with spacelike separated regions commute ( locality ). For every region  ). For every region  , the elements of   are
interpreted as the observables measurable in a lab located in  . 
     
       This paper deals with the question whether, given a single element
  for some bounded  , one can find a smallest
nonempty region   within which   can be measured. From a
theorem of Landau it is well known that in at least 1+2 spacetime
dimensions, one observable cannot be measured in two labs located in
disjoint spacetime regions. A generalization of this theorem will be
proved below, and for at least 1+2 spacetime dimensions, it will lead
to several meaningful definitions of convex localization regions. Some
additional technical assumptions then provide a strongest localization
prescription with the property that observables with spacelike
separated localization regions commute. But the fact that locality of
the net alone (not even together with those assumptions that lead to
the definition of a nonempty localization region) does not imply this
version of locality, is a little surprising. 
     
       This article is structured as follows: Section  
discusses the notation, concepts, and basic assumptions that play a
role in this paper. Section   collects
and completes the tools that will be used in what follows. Section
  contains the main results of the paper. In Section
  the theorem due to Landau mentioned above is
discussed and generalized: it states that in 1+2 or more spacetime
dimensions, the algebras of any two double cones with disjoint
closures only have in common the complex multiples of the identity
operator. Using the techniques introduced in the first sections, it
is shown that this result can be generalized to the  empty-intersection theorem : instead of considering two double cones,
one can consider one double cone and any finite number of wedge
regions; if the closures of the regions under consideration have an
empty common intersection, then the corresponding algebras have in
common exactly the c-numbers. : instead of considering two double cones,
one can consider one double cone and any finite number of wedge

       In Section  , finally, it is discussed how
one can, in 1+2 or more spacetime dimensions, use the
empty-intersection theorem in order to associate a nonempty  localization region  with any given   with any given  single  local observable that
is not a multiple of the identity. But even though locality of the
net is assumed from the outset, the question whether local observables
with spacelike separated localization regions commute turns out to be
nontrivial. A necessary and sufficient criterion for the locality of
such a localization prescription is provided by the   local observable that
is not a multiple of the identity. But even though locality of the
net is assumed from the outset, the question whether local observables
with spacelike separated localization regions commute turns out to be
nontrivial. A necessary and sufficient criterion for the locality of
such a localization prescription is provided by the  nonempty-intersection theorem : the criterion requires that, given any
finite family of wedges, all local observables contained in the
algebras associated with all these wedges are contained in the algebra
associated with any neighbourhood of the intersection of the wedges as
well. It is shown that an additional additivity assumption, which is
typically fulfilled by nets arising from Wightman fields, implies this
criterion, so it should be quite difficult to find nonpathological
counterexamples. On the other hand it is illustrated why the
nonempty-intersection criterion, though looking quite natural, is far
from self-evident. It does not follow from the locality property of
the net. : the criterion requires that, given any

Hilbert space, and   will be a
net of observables as defined above, i.e., a net which satisfies
locality and isotony. The union of all algebras

involutive algebra   called the algebra of  local observables .
Throughout Section  .
Throughout Section   it will be assumed that  , but for the
introductory part this assumption is not yet necessary. 
       
         The following (standard) assumptions on   will be made throughout this
article: 
       
         
            (A) Translation covariance.      is
 covariant  under a strongly continuous unitary
representation   under a strongly continuous unitary
representation   of the group   of spacetime translations,
i.e., 
           for every bounded region   and every  .
 
 (B) Spectrum condition.  The spectrum of the four-momentum operator
generating   The spectrum of the four-momentum operator
generating   is contained in the closure of the forward light cone.
 
 (C) Existence and uniqueness of the vacuum. 
The space of  
The space of  -invariant vectors in   is
one-dimensional.   will
denote an arbitrary, but fixed unit vector   in this space,
the  vacuum vector .  .   is  cyclic  with respect to
  with respect to
 , i.e.,  . 
         
         Throughout Section   the following additional assumption will be made: 
         
            (D) Reeh-Schlieder property.  For every nonempty bounded
open region   For every nonempty bounded
open region  , the space
  is dense in  . 
         
         Assumptions (A) and (B) make sure that the system described by the net
has a well-defined
four-momentum whose spectrum ensures energetic stability of the system. 
       
         Given Assumptions (A) and (B), Assumption (C) holds if and only if
  induces a unique and pure vacuum state, which, in turn, holds
if and only if the algebra   is irreducible. A sufficient
condition for this uniqueness is that
the bicommutant   of   is a factor
(Thm. III.3.2.6 in  ). But as soon as   is separable,
this implies that the uniqueness
part of Assumption (C) does not mean any loss of generality:
every von Neumann algebra in a separable Hilbert space
admits a direct-integral decomposition
into factors, and since the unitaries representing the translations
commute with the elements of the center of  , one can conclude that
almost all factors of the central
decomposition inherit Properties (A) and (B) (cf. also the remarks in
 , Sect. III.3.2, and references therein). 
       
         The Reeh-Schlieder property, Assumption (D),
holds for all Wightman fields  . If the region   contains
an open cone, it is well known to follow from conditions (A) through (C)
(cf., e.g., the Appendix in  ). The Reeh-Schlieder property
holds as soon as one has  weak additivity  (  ( , cf. also Thm. 7.3.37 in
 ): if   is any bounded open region, then 
         Conversely, it is well known that weak additivity can be derived from the
Reeh-Schlieder property as well, provided Assumptions (A) through (C) hold
(cf., e.g., Lemma 2.6 in  ). For the reader&#8217;s convenience
we include a proof of this fact in the appendix. 
       
         Some special classes of spacetime regions will be used below. The first one
is the class   of  double cones , i.e., all regions
of the form  , i.e., all regions
of the form  ,  .
The class   of  wedges  consists of the region
  consists of the region
  and its images under Poincar&#233;
transforms. 
       
         If   is a region in  , one denotes by   the
 causal complement  or   or  spacelike complement , which is the
region consisting of all points that are spacelike with respect to all
points of  , which is the
region consisting of all points that are spacelike with respect to all
points of  . The spacelike complement of the spacelike complement
  is called the  causal completion  of
  of
 , and   is called  causally complete  if   if  . It is
convenient to denote the interior of   by  . 
       
           and   are subclasses of the class   of convex, causally
complete and open proper subsets of  .
The wedges in   are maximal elements of  
in the sense that for every wedge  , every element  
with   is
a wedge. Every element   of   is an intersection of wedges
(cf.  , Thm. 3.2)  For the proof of
this statement it is essential
that   consists of open regions (the statement also implies to regions
with a nonempty interior). As a
counterexample, consider the lightlike half plane
 . One checks that
this region is causally complete and convex, while it is not an
intersection of wedges. . The class of
all wedges that contain a region  . The class of
all wedges that contain a region   will be denoted by
 . 
       
         In general, the causal complement of a region in   is not
convex. If  , then  
is a union of wedges ( , Thm. 3.2), and
  will denote the class of all wedges that are
subsets of  .
If   is an open convex region and if   is a convex region that is spacelike
separated from  , there is a wedge  
such that   and   (cf.  , Prop. 3.1). 
       
           will denote the bounded elements of the class  . Clearly, the
double cones are in  . Every element of   is contained in some
double cone, and it is precisely the intersection of all such double
cones ( , Prop. 3.8). The class of all double cones which
contain a region   will be denoted by
 , and the class of all double cones contained in an
arbitrary region   will be called  . 
       
         In Section  , two more technical assumptions will occur: 
         
            (E) Wedge duality.  For all   For all  , one has  .
 
 (F) Wedge additivity.  For each
wedge   For each
wedge   and each double cone   with   one
has 
           
         All nets arising from finite-component Wightman fields satisfy wedge
duality  . One checks that wedge duality implies the
condition of essential duality known from the analysis of
superselection sectors, since for any two spacelike separated regions
in  , one can find a wedge which contains one of the two, whereas
its spacelike complement contains the other one
(see above, and cf. Lemma   below). The algebras  
will also occur below for other regions  , e.g., for
double cones. By locality,  , and with the above remarks, it is easy to show that as
soon as wedge duality holds, one obtains that
for spacelike separated double cones   and  ,
the elements of the algebras   and   commute,
a property which is called  essential duality  and which is used
in the theory of localized superselection sectors (cf.   and which is used
in the theory of localized superselection sectors (cf.  
and references given there). 
       
         Condition (F) strengthens Condition (D) slightly, but it is a standard
property of all Wightman fields as well. It has been used
extensively by Thomas and Wichmann
in  . The authors have obtained results in the spirit of
Theorem   and Proposition   below, but their
results do not imply ours. 
       
         Occasionally, terminology borrowed from PDEs and General Relativity
will be used (timelike curves, Cauchy surfaces, etc.). These notions
will not be defined in detail, but will be used as in  .

         It is a classical result of the Wightman approach to quantum field
theory that one can reconstruct a Wightman field from its vacuum
expectation values  .
The following lemma shows how one can reconstruct commutation
relations of a net of observables from the behaviour of its vacuum
expectation values. Since these have some convenient properties, this
will facilitate the subsequent investigations.   will be a local net
of local observables satisfying the above Assumptions (A) through (C). 
      <subsection title="Lemma">
           
              For an arbitrary double cone  , let   be an element of
 .  
 
 
             
                (i) If a region   contains some
open cone and has the property that

(iii) Assume that   exhibits the Reeh-Schlieder property, and

            Proof.  (i): If   (i): If   is an open cone
contained in  , there is a translation  
such that  .
Choose   and   in   and   in  .
Since  , the operators   and   commute: 
           Since   is in  , the assumption implies 
           and since   and  , in turn, commute because of  ,
one concludes 
           But since   and   are arbitrary elements of  , and since
  is cyclic with respect to this algebra,
it follows that  ; since
  was arbitrary, one obtains  , which is (i). 
         
           (ii) Choose   and   in   and   in  .
Since   has been assumed to be in  , it commutes with  , so 
           Since   is in  , the assumption implies 
           and since   and   commute by the assumption that  ,
one concludes 
           But since   and   are arbitrary elements of  , and since
by the Reeh-Schlieder property,   is cyclic with
respect to this algebra,
it follows that  ; since
  was arbitrary, one obtains  , which is (ii). 
         
           (iii) There is a translation  
such that  , so that  .
Now choose a   such that   intersects  , and let  
be a double cone contained in  . Isotony implies that
 . Since by assumption,
  for all
 , (ii) implies that  . Now one can iterate
this procedure: choose an arbitrary   such that  
is nonempty, choose a new double cone   in this intersection, and
conclude from (ii) that  .
Note that only the
double cone   chosen in the first step
needs to be spacelike separated from  , since
each step uses the result of the preceding one, so one finds that for
 every     , one proves that   with a finite
number of steps.
The statement now follows from weak additivity, which follows from
the Reeh-Schlieder property (see above), and from irreducibility. 
         
            
         
           
           Given any two local observables  , the
commutator function   will henceforth be defined by 
           Due to Lemma  , the analysis of the support of
this function yields
information on the structure of the net. Crucial for this analysis
is the fact that   is a boundary value of a solution of
the wave equation, and a well-known lemma due to Asgeirsson
concerning such solutions (cf.,  , Sect. 4.4.D in  ,
or  ) immediately implies the following lemma,
which, for this reason, will be referred to as Asgeirsson&#8217;s
Lemma. Another important consequence of the &#8216;wave nature&#8217;&#8201; of the
function   is a theorem due to Jost, Lehmann and Dyson  
which will also be recalled for the reader&#8217;s convenience.

              If the commutator function   and all its partial derivatives
are zero along a
timelike curve segment  ,   vanishes in the entire double cone

            Proof.  The Fourier transform of the
operator valued function   The Fourier transform of the
operator valued function  
is the spectral measure of the four-momentum operator. It follows
that the Fourier transform   of the function

           is a continuous function with   for all

equation. This implies the statement by Asgeirsson&#8217;s result for solutions of
the wave equation, see the references quoted above. 
         
            
         
           
           Evidently, the assumption of the lemma is satisfied as soon as   vanishes in
some open neighbourhood of  .
In the proof of Theorem   below, however, the function   defined in
the proof is analysed, and the information one has about  
from locality merely implies that   vanishes in a null set of

makes use of the fact that   has been
constructed in such a way that all its partial derivatives, including
the one in the  -direction, are zero at all points of this null set;
one may then use the above lemma to show that the region
where   vanishes also extends into the  -direction.

The following lemma collects some relations between these notions
most of which will be used below.

              (i) Every causally complete region is timelike convex.
 
(ii) Every timelike convex region is Asgeirsson complete.
 
(iii) Every timelike convex and bounded open region
is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region.
 
(iv) The causal complement of a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson
region is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region.
 
(v) Let   and   be timelike convex regions, and assume that there
exists a Cauchy surface   which
is a subset of both   and  . Then
the region   is timelike convex (and, like   and  ,
trivially, a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region).
 
(vi) Let   be an increasing family of Jost-Lehmann-Dyson
regions. Then   is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region. 
           
           Before proving the lemma, we give some counterexamples to strengthened statements or
converse implications.
An example of a timelike convex region (and Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region)
that is not causally complete (cf. (i))
is the time slice region  . An example of an
Asgeirsson complete region that is not timelike convex (cf. (ii)) is the
union of two disjoint double cones at a timelike distance; this
shows that the classes of timelike convex regions and of Jost-Lehmann-Dyson
regions, respectively, are not stable under taking unions,
so Statement (v) is far from tautological.
The same holds for the class of Asgeirsson complete regions: consider the
regions   and   for some   with  .
One easily checks that both regions are Asgeirsson
complete, while their union is not: its Asgeirsson hull is  .
If  , the two regions are even Jost-Lehmann-Dyson regions,
while their union evidently is not (cf. (v) and (vi)). 
         
           An example of a timelike convex region which is neither causally
complete nor a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region (cf. (iii))is the region 
           since there are timelike curves which do not intersect  , e.g.,
the curve  . 
         
           
            Proof of Lemma  . 
(i) Let  
(i) Let   be a causally complete region, and pick two points
  and  . The causal
completion   of the set   is the closure of the
double cone  ,
and since   implies  , this immediately implies (i). 
         
           Statement (ii) immediately follows from the definition. 
         
           (iii) Let   be timelike convex, bounded and open.
Since   is open, a point   is
not contained in the spacelike complement  
if and only if it is timelike with respect to some point
of  , i.e.,  , where   is the open light cone. Now
let   be an inextendible timelike curve that does not intersect  .
Since   does
not intersect  , it has to stay within the region  .
But since   is an inextendible timelike curve, while  
is bounded,   cannot stay in
the future   or the past   of  , i.e., it
has to pass from   to  . Since both these regions are
open, while   is continuous, it follows that it has to
hit the region  . But this region coincides with  
since   is timelike convex and open, so
  hits  , which is a contradiction and proves (iii). 
         
           (iv) The causal complement of any region is causally complete, by (i),
this enhances timelike convexity of  .
The condition that  
is intersected by every inextendible timelike curve implies that
  ( )
is intersected by every such curve. This proves (iv). 
         
           (v) Let   and   be points in   that are timelike with respect
to each other. Since   is timelike convex, one finds an
inextendible timelike curve   hitting both
  and  . Let   be the unique point where   hits  .
Since   and   are timelike convex, and since  ,
the closed double cones with the tips   and   and the
tips   and  , respectively, are subsets in  .
If with respect to the time ordering along  ,   is earlier or later
than both   and  , it follows that the double cone with tips
  and   is contained in   as well. If   is between   and  ,
then, as before, we can conclude that the segments of  
between   and  
and between   and   is a subset of  , and since
 , it follows that all of
the segment of   joining   to   is a subset of  .
Since  
can be  any  inextendible timelike curve hitting   inextendible timelike curve hitting   and  , one obtains
that all timelike curve segments joining   and   are contained in
 , so the double cone with tips   and  
is contained in  , which completes the proof of (v). 
         
           (vi) Let   and   be two points in   at a timelike distance. There are
a   and a   such that   and
 , so it follows that both   and   are elements of
 . Since this region is timelike convex,
it follows that the double cone with tips   and   is in  , proving
that   is timelike convex. 
         
           It remains to be shown that every inextendible timelike curve intersects
 . Let   be an inextendible timelike curve that does not
intersect  . Since all   are Jost-Lehmann-Dyson regions, it
follows that   has to intersect every  , so it has
to intersect the region  . This completes
the proof. 
         
            
         
           
           The above statements and proofs can be extended in a straightforward
manner to the spacetime one obtains by endowing the cyclinder 
           with the
spacetime structure it inherits from  , provided  . For
  this spacetime fails to be timelike convex, and the proof of
part (v) does no longer work. For further results of the above kind,
see  . The useful property of Jost-Lehmann-Dyson regions
(which is the reason to call them so) is established by the following
theorem.

Since   is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region in  ,
its 1+(s+1)-dimensional Asgeirsson hull   is easily seen to be
a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region in  .
Provided this region is &#8216;well-behaved&#8217;, there is a
Cauchy surface   in  .
This Cauchy surface has the property that for every point  , either
both the forward and the backward part of  
or neither of them intersects  . The former case occurs if and only if
 .
The latter case occurs if and only if  ,
the Asgeirsson hull   of   and the spacelike complement
being taken in the spacetime  .
But since all partial derivatives of   can be checked to
vanish in all points in  , one obtains from Lemma   that
  vanishes in  , the support of   contains only
points of the second kind, i.e.,
it is contained in  . This implies
that the support of   is contained in  . 
         
           Since   is a boundary value of   and
since the intersection of   with   is the
convex hull of a shifted mass hyperboloid, the support of the
boundary value   of the function   is contained in the union
of admissible mass hyperboloids, as stated. 
         
            
         
           
           We conclude this section with another lemma to be used below that concerns
the geometry of Minkowski space.

       By definition, a local net associates algebras with regions.
In the sequel it will be discussed how to associate a localization
region with a given algebra and even with a single local observable.
The analysis is based on a theorem
due to Landau  . In order to localize single observables, a
new generalization of Landau&#8217;s theorem will be used. It will be stated
and proved below. 
     
       This section is structured as follows:
in Section  , the theorem of Landau
and its consequences for the localization of algebras will be
discussed, and the mentioned generalization will be proved.
This generalization
will be the basis for the analysis of localization regions for single
local observables, which is presented in Section  . 
     
       In what follows, Assumptions (A) through (D) will be made without
further mentioning, and it will assumed in addition that  ;
Landau&#8217;s theorem and all generalizations discussed below heavily depend on
this assumption, and so do the consequences to be discussed later on.

              Let   be a family of   wedges in  .
If  , then 
             
            Proof.  Choose an   Choose an  , and
let   be a double cone with   (or  ). 
         
           Since the wedges   have empty common intersection,
so do the compact regions  . But
if a finite family of compact regions have empty common intersection,
there is an   such that the family of the  -neighbourhoods
of the regions still have empty common intersection. The proof of this is
an elementary induction proof: any two disjoint compact regions have a
positive distance, which implies the statement for two regions. Now assume
the statement to hold for any family of   compact sets, and
let   be a family of n+1 regions. If   of these
regions already have empty common intersection, there is nothing more
to prove. So consider the case that the set   is nonempty. This region is compact and, as
shown, has a finite distance   from  , so the  
neighbourhoods of the two regions still have a finite distance.
But the  -neighbourhood of   is the intersection
of the  -neighbourhoods of  , so the statement
follows for  . 
         
           It follows from this that
there is a double cone   which is so small that the wedge
 ,  , and the
double cone   (cf. Lemma   above to
see that these regions are a wedge and a double cone, respectively)
still have empty
common intersection. Choose any  . By locality,
the commutator function   vanishes
in the region  . 
         
           There is no admissible mass hyperboloid for this region. To see
this, note that if a (shifted) mass hyperboloid is disjoint from
a union of wedges, so is the unique shift
 ,  , of the closure of the full light cone
which contains the hyperboloid.
Now choose   such that   is disjoint from
all  ,  , and from  , which
is a union of wedges, too. This is equivalent to
 , i.e., 
           Hence there is no admissible mass hyperboloid for  . 
         
           If   is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region, it follows from
Theorem   that   vanishes for all   and all
 ,
so using part (iii) of Lemma  , one concludes that
 , and the proof is complete. 
         
           But since   does not need to be a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region,
Asgeirsson&#8217;s lemma will be used to show that the function  
vanishes in a larger region   which is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson
region. Since there is no admissible hyperboloid
for  , there is, a fortiori, no admissible
hyperboloid for  , so the proof will be complete as soon as
  has been shown to exhibit the stated properties. 
         
           To this end, choose coordinates such that   is the double cone 
           where   denotes the unit vector in the 0-direction, and
  is the radius of the double cone  .
Let   be the
boundary of the cylinder of radius   around the time axis in
 , and define 
           All these regions are bounded subsets of  .
Due to our choice of coordinates, the region  
is a strip: 
           (which is empty if  ). 
         
           For  , the
wedge   is timelike convex in  , so the region
  is timelike convex
with respect to the inherited spacetime structure of  .
We now show that there is a   such that
the union  
is timelike convex as well for all  . To this end,
let   be a spacelike hypersurface in  .
As a spacelike surface, it is a subset of   up to a
compact set. For   so large that this compact set is
enclosed by   one finds that   is a subset of
 . Since   is a Cauchy surface in the spacetime  ,
it follows that   and  
are timelike convex regions in the spacetime  
whose intersection contains a Cauchy surface,
so part (v) of Lemma   implies that  
is timelike convex. This proves that   with the stated properties
exists for  . 
         
           Now choose  ,
and apply Lemma   (v) another   times to conclude that the region 
           is timelike convex in  .
Since the  -Asgeirsson hull  
is open, bounded, and timelike convex, it is a
Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region by Lemma   (iii). 
         
           On the other hand, the part of   and
 , respectively, which is enclosed by  
is a subset of the  -Asgeirsson hull
  of  . It follows that 
           and by Asgeirsson&#8217;s lemma,   vanishes in  .
Since the Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region   increases with  ,
it follows from Lemma   (vi)
that   is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson region.
This is what remained to be shown, so the proof is complete. 
         
            
         
           
           Actually, the following, slightly stronger version has been established
by the preceding proof:

           After completing this article, it was brought to the author&#8217;s
attention that in 1+3 dimensions, one can also use the results of
Thomas and Wichmann for the above proof. As the region
  is a union of wedges, one can
apply Theorem 3.6 in   to prove that the function  
vanishes in the causal closure of this region, which one can check to
be all of  . Their proof, which uses a completely different line
of argument, has been written down for 1+3 dimensions only, and it is
not evident whether it also holds in other dimensions; verifying this
would require to check several hard proofs at the end of
 . On the other hand the Thomas-Wichmann analysis is more
general in other aspects, so the reader interested in the above
special problem may find the above argument more direct. 
        </subsection></subsection><subsection title="The localization region of a single local observable and&#10;the nonempty-intersection theorem">
         Theorem   prepares for the definition of a localization region for
local observables. As the following proposition shows, there are several
&#8216;natural&#8217;&#8201; ways how to define such a localization region, and it follows
from the empty-intersection theorem that all of them yield nonempty
localization regions. 
      <subsection title="Proposition">
           
              Let   be any of the classes  ,  ,   and  . For every
  which is not a multiple of the identity, the  localization regions  
              are nonempty, causally complete, convex, and compact sets.
Between them, one has the following equalities and inclusions: 
             
            Proof.  We start with the proof of the equalities and inclusions.
The equalities immediately follow from the definitions,
since on the one hand,   We start with the proof of the equalities and inclusions.
The equalities immediately follow from the definitions,
since on the one hand,   and  , while on the
other hand,
every region in   is an intersection of double cones in  
and every region in   is an intersection of wedges in   (see
Section  ). The inclusions in the upper
and the lower row of the diagram immediately follow from locality. The
inclusions in the two columns follow from the fact that every double
cone is an intersection of wedges and that, by isotony, an observable
contained in the algebra associated with a given double cone is
contained in all algebras associated with wedges containing this
double cone. 
         
           By these inclusions, it is sufficient to prove that   is
nonempty if  . It already follows from Theorem
  that the intersection of the closures of any
finite family of wedges
whose algebras contain   is nonempty. But the family of all wedges
whose algebras contain   is never finite. 
         
           Since   is a local observable,
there is a double cone   with  , and it follows from
isotony, locality, and the above inclusions
that  .
But this implies that 
           which is an intersection of subsets of the compact set
 . But if for a class of closed subsets of a compact
space, every finite subclass has a nonempty intersection, it follows
from the Heine-Borel property
that the whole class has a nonempty intersection. Now Corollary
  implies the statement. 
         
            
         
           
           In the sequel the maps   and   will be referred to as  localization
prescriptions .

if   for all  , and
the prescriptions   and   coincide if the net satisfies
wedge duality. Furthermore, wedge duality also makes   coincide
with   by the following lemma (cf. also  , Lemma 4.1).

              Assume the net   to satisfy wedge duality. For every
region  , one has

We first show that the net  
We first show that the net   satisfies locality.
This immediately follows from the fact remarked above
that if   and   are spacelike separated regions
in  , there is a wedge   with   and  . For such a constellation one has 
           which is the stated locality for the net  . 
         
           One proves in the same way that the net
  satisfies locality with respect to  , i.e.,
  for all  .
On the other hand, 
           and this completes the proof. 
         
            
         
           
           So if one assumes wedge duality, the localization prescriptions
 ,  , and   coincide and provide the
smallest localization region out of the above suggestions.
In what follows, wedge duality will be assumed, and for every local
observable  , we simply write
 . 
         
           Now the question arises in how far   can be considered as the
region where the observable   can be measured. For this
interpretation to be consistent it is important that the localization
prescription   satisfies  locality  in the sense that
observables with spacelike separated localization regions commute.
This does   in the sense that
observables with spacelike separated localization regions commute.
This does  not  follow from the locality assumption made for the
net   follow from the locality assumption made for the
net  . To illustrate this, consider the wedge
 , where   is the unit vector in the 1-direction, and
its images   and   under rotations in the 1-2-plane by  
and  , respectively. Assume a local observable   to be
contained in   and in  , while another local
observable   is contained in   and  . In this
case, the localization regions   and   are spacelike with
respect to each other, but locality of the net alone is not yet
sufficient to conclude that   and   should commute, since not any
two of the three wedges are spacelike separated. 
         
           Actually, this simplified sketch already points towards the
sufficient and necessary condition for locality of

              Assume   to satisfy wedge duality and wedge additivity.
Then the localization prescription   satisfies locality. 
           
            Proof. 
Let  
Let   and   be local observables with spacelike separated localization
regions. There is a wedge   such that   and  .
So as soon as one proves that this implies   and  ,
wedge duality implies the statement. 
         
           To this end, we consider any
  and any wedge   whose closure is spacelike separated from  ,
and show that  .
This follows from wedge additivity as soon as one has found a
double cone   with the property that   and that
  vanishes in   for all  . 
         
           So fix an   such that the  -neighbourhood  
of   is still spacelike separated from  .
As in the proof of Theorem  , we choose
a finite number of wedges   in the class   such that 
           Now define 
           for some   (again,   denotes the unit vector in the
time direction), and note that  .
Fixing   sufficiently small, one can make sure that 
           Choosing any  , one obtains
from wedge duality that the commutator function   defined
above vanishes in the region 
           which is a
union of wedges. 
         
           As in the proof of Theorem  ,   can be
shown to vanish in a larger region   which is a Jost-Lehmann-Dyson
region. This can be shown by mimicking the corresponding part of that
proof, as it does not depend on the assumption that the intersection of
the closed wedges under consideration is empty. So one can
keep  ,  , and the double cone  ,
choose some double cone   with  , replace

like above to construct  . 
         
           A mass hyperboloid   is
admissible with respect to   only if it is admissible with respect to  ,
and as   is a union of closed wedges,
this is the case only if the whole unique shift
of the open light cone which contains   is disjoint from  .
But by Theorem  ,
this implies that in particular,   vanishes in the region  ,
completing the proof. 
         
            
         
           
           Thomas and Wichmann have obtained a similar result for 1+3 dimensions

given examples for theories where the corresponding algebras
differ. In particular, they differ if the &#8216;large&#8217;&#8201; net   has the
intersection property, i.e., if   for

general property of all local nets of observables. 
         
           While Landau&#8217;s examples do satisfy all of our above conditions, they
illustrate that the sufficient and necessary condition for   to be
local is not self-evident, as it is similar to the intersection
property violated by Landau&#8217;s examples. On the other hand, the fact
that all our sufficient conditions for the locality of   hold,
gives some hope that locality of   is a rather natural property of
local nets.

       Generalizing Landau&#8217;s result that the algebras associated with two

additional assumption of wedge duality, there is a natural way how to
obtain a smallest localization region from the empty-intersection
theorem. Even in this situation it is a nontrivial issue whether
observables with spacelike separated localization regions commute. As
a necessary and sufficient condition for this, the  nonempty-intersection theorem  establishes a special intersection
property, and sufficient for this property is the additional condition
of wedge additivity, a property typically shared by models arising
from Wightman fields. As these results depend on very weak
additional assumptions, locality of the localization prescription
  establishes a special intersection
property, and sufficient for this property is the additional condition
of wedge additivity, a property typically shared by models arising
from Wightman fields. As these results depend on very weak
additional assumptions, locality of the localization prescription
  turns out to be a rather natural property of local nets. 
     
       The question what the intersection of two algebras of local
observables contains has arised earlier, as, e.g., the remarks in
Section III.4.2 of Haag&#8217;s monograph   show. Haag&#8217;s &#8216;Tentative Postulate&#8217;&#8201; that the map   be a
homomorphism from the orthocomplemented lattice of all causally
complete regions (which, in general, are neither bounded nor convex)
of Minkowski space into the orthocomplemented lattice of von Neumann
algebras on a Hilbert space does not hold in general as it stands
(cf. also Haag&#8217;s heuristic remarks which illustrate the physical
limits of the postulate). But if a net satisfies wedge duality and
strong additivity for wedges, the above results, indeed, imply parts
of Haag&#8217;s conjecture: for arbitrary finite families of wedges, one
obtains relations in the spirit of (III.4.7) through (III.4.11) in
  for the dual net. 
     
       The results of this article have been used for the analysis of the
Unruh effect and related symmetries of quantum fields
 . Proceeding, so to
speak, in the converse direction, Thomas and Wichmann have
investigated the implications that the symmetries providing the Unruh
effect exert on the localization behaviour of local
observables. Assuming the theory to exhibit the Unruh-effect and a
couple of (standard) technical properties including wedge additivity,
they found that the localization region of an observable   with
respect to a minimal Poincar&#233; covariant local net generated by  
is the smallest region   in   with the property that for every
 , one has  
if and only if    . This
definition of a localization region no longer explicitly refers to any other
operators of the net (while it does refer to the representation, which, by
the Bisognano-Wichmann symmetries, is closely related to the net). While
this interesting conclusion has been derived from the Unruh effect and
other assumptions of relevance in the above discussion, all these
assumptions have been avoided above since they are a goal rather than
a starting point of the above analysis. In this sense, the results of
Thomas and Wichmann are complementary to the above results.
