  <section title="Introduction"><subsection title="The CDS">        The Centre de Donn&#233;es astronomiques de Strasbourg
(CDS) defines, develops, and maintains services
to help the astronomers find the information
they need from the
very rapidly increasing wealth of astronomical information, and
particularly of on-line information.         CDS is operated at the Strasbourg astronomical
Observatory, under an agreement between French
Institut National des Sciences de l&#8217;Univers (INSU) and
Universit&#233; Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg (ULP). CDS personnel
created and implemented the  Simbad  data bank and maintain its data
and software system.         A detailed description of the CDS on-line services can be found, e.g.,
in Egret et al.&#160;( )
and in Genova et al.&#160;( ,  ,  ),
or at the CDS web site .
Questions or comments about the
CDS services can be sent to the hot line  question@simbad.u-strasbg.fr .</subsection><subsection title="SIMBAD">        The  Simbad  database contains identifications,
&#8216;basic data&#8217;, bibliographical references,
and selected observational measurements for more than
2.7 million astronomical objects (November 1999).
Data and information published in  Simbad come from selected catalogues and tables
and from the whole astronomical literature.         The specificity of the  Simbad  database is to
organize the information per astronomical object,
thus offering a unique perspective on astronomical data.
This is done through a careful cross-identification
of objects from catalogues, lists, and journal articles.
The ability to gather together any sort of published
observational data related to stars or galaxies has
made  Simbad  a key tool used worldwide for all kinds
of astronomical studies.         Simbad  is the acronym for  S et of I dentifications, M easurements
and  B ibliography
for  A stronomical D ata.         The main access point to  Simbad is the WWW home page ;
there is a mirror copy at SAO,
Harvard .</subsection><subsection title="Historical background">        Building a reference database for stars &#8211; and, later, for
extragalactic objects and all astronomical objects outside
the Solar System &#8211; has been the first goal of the CDS:  Simbad is the result of an on-going effort which started soon after
the creation of CDS in 1972. Simbad  was created by merging the Catalog of Stellar Identifications
(CSI, Ochsenbein et al.&#160; ) and the Bibliographic Star Index
(Ochsenbein  )
as they existed until 1979. The resulting data base
(at that time, about 400,000 objects, mainly stars) was then
expanded by the addition of source data from the catalogs and
tables, and by new literature references.
The database was extended to galaxies
and other non-stellar objects in 1983 (Dubois et al.  ).
For details about the early developments of  Simbad  see
Egret ( ).         The first on-line interactive version
of  Simbad  was released in 1981, and operated
at the Strasbourg Cronenbourg computer
center until December 1984,
when it was moved to Universit&#233; Paris-Sud at
Orsay, and operated there until June 30, 1990.
The database is now hosted on a
Unix server, at the Strasbourg Observatory.         The original command line interface has been complemented by
an interactive X-Window interface ( XSimbad ) in 1994,
and by a World-Wide Web interface in 1996.
There is also a client/server mode, providing quick responses
to simple queries, essentially for the name resolution in
archives and information systems (see Section&#160; ).         For descriptions of earlier stages of the database,
see Heck &amp; Egret ( ), and Egret et al.&#160;( ).</subsection></section><section title="SIMBAD main features">      Simbad  is, in the first place, a database of identifications,
aliases and names of astronomical objects: in principle any name
found in the literature &#8211; provided it is given as a
syntactically correct character string &#8211; can be submitted
to  Simbad  in order to
retrieve basic information known for this object,
as well as pointers to complementary data and bibliography.
This implies a continuous careful cross-identification
of objects from catalogues, lists, and journal articles.
This ability to gather together any sort of published
observational data related to stars or galaxies is
the first key feature of  Simbad .       Another unique feature is the complete and up-to-date
bibliographic survey of the astronomical literature:
objects are associated with the references of all
papers in which they are mentioned, independently of the
aliases used to name the object.       In addition, the Dictionary of Nomenclature
(Section  )
is an essential tool for managing the very complex nomenclature
of objects found in the literature, and for matching
naming variations with those adopted or simply accepted by Simbad . It also includes hints for helping to solve ambiguities,
according to the type of object, or to the format.
This is complemented by the  sesame  module
within  Simbad ,
for the management of possible variations in the
naming of astronomical objects.       The database management system of  Simbad (Section  ) has been developed
in-house at CDS, using
the concepts of object-oriented programming.       Simbad  is kept up-to-date (Section  )
on a daily basis, as the
result of the collaboration of CDS with bibliographers
in Institut d&#8217;Astrophysique de Paris and the
Paris and Bordeaux observatories.       The statistical contents of the database
(Section&#160; ) can be summarized
in a few figures as follows
(the figures quoted are statistics of November 1999):</section><section title="SIMBAD astronomical contents"><subsection title="The objects">        The  Simbad  data base presently contains information for about:                  The only astronomical objects
specifically excluded from  Simbad  are the Sun and
Solar System bodies.         The  Simbad  database is primarily organized per astronomical object.
The aim is to provide, as much as possible, the user
with all published information
(identifications, observational
data, bibliographical references, and pointers towards
external archives) concerning any given object, or list
of objects.         The two main channels for feeding the database are the following:         Catalogues are selected for integration with
priority given to those which can
help provide an optimal support for
the large projects conducted within the astronomical community.
A large effort was, for instance, devoted in recent years to stellar
catalogues (PPM, HIC, CCDM), in the context of the Hipparcos project,
and to multi-wavelength identifications (IRAS PSC, Einstein 1E and
2E catalogues, older X&#8211;ray catalogues, the IUE Merged Log, etc.).
The Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues (ESA  )
have been recently included, and inclusion of the ROSAT All
Sky Survey is planned in the near future.         In parallel, the systematic scanning of the
bibliography reflects the diversity and general trends of research
in astronomy, and takes into account shorter lists. The published lists
from the microlensing surveys, or e.g. the EUVE catalogues, were folded
into the database as a result of this scanning.         When an object is
found in the literature or in a catalogue, its possible
cross-identification with objects already in  Simbad  is
systematically studied, before entering the reference
and the new object name in the database.
About 4500 different names of
catalogues or object lists from published papers can
currently be found in  Simbad ,
covering all the wavelength domains from high energy astrophysics to
radio.         When no proper name is suggested by the authors, or
when the acronym generates an ambiguity with already existing ones,
the current practice, shared with the NED database, is to create
an acronym within brackets using the initials of the last names
of the first three authors, and the year of publication.
For example, [HFE83] 366 is the 366th entry in the main table
of a paper by Helmer, Fabricius, Einicke and colleagues published in 1983.
From the year 2000 on, the year will be noted with four digits (e.g.,
[ABC2000]).         Many objects have more than one name, since the database
contains more than 7.5 million object names for
2.7 million objects.
Examples of objects with more than 50 identifiers,
are the galaxy  M 87  in Virgo, the bright stars Procyon  and  Capella ,
the quasar  3C 273 , the  Crab Nebula .         To help the users with the complex nomenclature
of astronomical objects, the CDS now maintains
and distributes on&#8211;line
the Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects
(first developed by Lortet et al.&#160; ; see
Section&#160; ).</subsection><subsection title="The Data">        In the following, the word  object  will be used
to designate a star, non stellar object, or collection of
objects such as a cluster, which corresponds to an individual
entry in  Simbad .
For each object, the following data are included when available:                  In the following, a more detailed description of
some of these elements is given.</subsection><subsection title="Cross&#8211;identifications" /><subsection title="Observational data">        Observational data are presently given for
the measurement types listed in
Table&#160; .         For each data type, one can retrieve individual data with
their bibliographical references, and, when available,
weighted means computed from existing observed values by
specialists in the related field.         When measurements are listed as a result of a  Simbad query, they are
normally preceded by a header providing a very short title
to each listed parameter.         The important r&#244;le now played by the  VizieR  database of catalogues
(Ochsenbein et al.&#160; ), coming with easier interoperability
of services, is changing the strategy for inclusion of observational
measurements into  Simbad . Let us take the example of
the Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues (ESA  ): once the HIP
or TYC identifier is available from  Simbad  it appears convenient
enough to provide the user with a WWW link to the corresponding data in
VizieR rather than overloading the  Simbad  database with the
full Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues.
This functionality is currently being implemented for important
catalogues which have already been cross-identified.         As a complement, the WWW interface includes pointers to external archives,
currently: the INES database of the IUE project
(Rodriguez-Pascual et al.&#160; ); the high-energy
observational archives at  heasarc  (HEASARC team  ).</subsection><subsection title="Bibliographical references">        One of the key features of the  Simbad  astronomical database
is the unique coverage of bibliographical references to objects.
The bibliographic index contains references to stars from
1950 onwards, and to galaxies and all other objects outside
the solar system from 1983 onwards. Presently
(November 1999) there are
about 3 million references taken from 110,000 papers
published in the 100 most important astronomical periodical
publications.</subsection><subsection title="Statistical aspects of the Data Contents">        The astronomical content of  Simbad  results from the complex process
of folding into the database a selection of important
catalogues, and of surveying the complete astronomical literature.         This can be illustrated by the histogram in   magnitudes
of Figure&#160; . The coverage is
reasonably complete up to beyond magnitude 10 for stars,
after the inclusion of the Tycho catalogue. Many objects
in the range 12 to 26th mag.&#160;come from extensive studies of objects
in selected sky areas: deep fields, external galaxies, etc.         Some well-known very large catalogues are not
part of  Simbad : for instance the Hubble Telescope
Guide Star Catalogue (GSC, Lasker et al.&#160; )
is not systematically included (even if GSC identifiers have been added
for all Tycho stars present in  Simbad ). This
results from a compromise aiming to save database load
as well as manpower for cross-identification and quality
control. Note that  VizieR  and  Aladin  give
access to the full GSC catalogue (and to even larger catalogues
and databases such as USNO-A, DENIS, 2MASS).         Fig.&#160;  illustrates the increase of the
data contents of the database in the years 1990 to 1999.</subsection></section><section title="SIMBAD structure and query management">      Simbad  query mechanism can be summarized by
the following key features:              The database management system of  Simbad  has been developed
by the CDS, using
the concepts of object-oriented programming.<subsection title="Object-oriented concepts">        The command language is using the concepts of objects (or agents).
Typical object classes are: astronomical object, object list, database, session,
reference list, filter, format. Examples of methods are: display,
describe, bye (quit).         This structure is only visible for the user of the command
line interface. The WWW interface is rendered quite independent
of the database structure.</subsection><subsection title="Indexing">        Simbad  is organized for optimized access by
identifier (through an index table of object names)
and by position, through an index of small regions.                  When a set of criteria includes some
limitations in coordinates, this generates the definition of
a list of boxes including the requested area:
all entries from these boxes are read
and checked against the whole set of criteria.         When a set of criteria includes no limits in sky position,
the complete database must be scanned &#8211; a long and
somewhat expensive operation, which takes typically
15 minutes in the current hardware configuration.</subsection><subsection title="Query by identifier">        In principle any name
found in the literature &#8211; provided it is given as a
syntactically correct character string &#8211; can be submitted
to the database in order to
retrieve information known for this object.         The general syntax of an identifier is
the abbreviated catalogue name (or acronym:
generally one to four characters), followed by
a number or a name (character string) within the catalogue.         Object names such as Vega and Altair, but also Barnard&#8217;s star,
Crab Nebula, Sgr A, HDFN, or HDFS
are stored in the database in a specific catalog
called &#8216; name &#8217;, while star names in constellations,
such as   Lyrae,
are stored in the catalogue &#8216; * &#8217;,
and variable stars (such as RR Lyrae)
in the catalogue &#8216; var &#8217; (also called &#8216; V* &#8217;).         The user can generally type Vega ,  Altair ,  alf Lyrae  (or  alf Lyr ):
the   name resolving module
(Section&#160; ) is used for
guessing the catalogue and making the
internal conversion.
There are however some
difficult cases in which the  name  keyword remains
necessary, such as in  name sgr 1900+14  where sgr  stands for Soft Gamma Repeater.         In addition the following hints can help the user
understand the best way to submit an identifier to  Simbad :                  Figure&#160;  illustrates the response received from
the database after submitting the identifier &#8216;M&#160;81&#8217;.
In the identifier list, the
meaning of acronyms, such as [VDD93], is explained through
a link to the on-line Dictionary of Nomenclature.         The user interface provides an option for querying
around objects, with a radius set by default at 10&#8242;.
This is equivalent to a query by position using the
object coordinates.         It is also possible to generate the list of 10 or 25 next
objects following a given identifier, or to
submit a list of object names,
stored in a file with one identifier per line.</subsection><subsection title="Query by coordinates">        Query by coordinates can be used to retrieve all objects
in a circular field
defined by the coordinates of the center and a radius.         The coordinates can be replaced by the name of
an object lying at the center of the field, in which case
the coordinates are found through an internal query to  Simbad . The radius can have any size (default value is
10&#8242;). Queries with a radius
smaller than 1&#8211;  are answered quite instantaneously.</subsection><subsection title="Sampling">        The sampling mode (also named filter) allows users
to define criteria for selecting objects in  Simbad .         The user may extract objects which satisfy one
set of coordinate criteria, several physical criteria
(using a simple syntax), objects which have specified
identifiers or measurements, and, finally, objects having
citations within a range of years.         The WWW interface provides an interactive form
which presents all possible sampling options.         The resulting list may be ordered
according to sort criteria and, furthermore,
it is possible, through the command line mode,
to define precisely the output format.         Note that reading the whole database for extracting a
sample spread on the whole celestial sphere is
possible, but quite time-consuming (as
mentioned above). The user is thus encouraged to
test the filter on a limited region of the sky, before
applying it to the whole database.</subsection><subsection title="Charts and sky maps">        After a sampling by position the user can ask for
the corresponding sky plot. This feature is only
available through the WWW interface and is generally optimized
for a radius range of 10&#8211;60 minutes.         The maps display the objects with different
symbols according to object type; symbol size
for stars varies with object
magnitude (see Figure&#160; ). The maps are clickable
and return the object in Simbad corresponding to
cursor position.         The WWW interface provides also direct
access to the  Aladin  interactive digitized atlas
(Bonnarel et al.&#160; ) as illustrated in Figure&#160; .</subsection><subsection title="Batch mode">        Simbad  can be queried in  batch mode , by
submitting a mail to the special address smbmail@simbad.u-strasbg.fr .         This is especially useful in case of poor
interactive connectivity, or for submitting
time-consuming queries or lists.
A WWW form helps to prepare the submission.</subsection><subsection title="Resolving a bibliographical reference code">        It is possible to obtain a complete bibliographical
reference, by entering the corresponding
reference code (bibcode).         A reference code can be supplied
without indicating all
the fields: the first reference corresponding to the
truncated code will be displayed.
An ampersand ( &amp; ) should be added
at the end of the truncated bibcode.</subsection><subsection title="Additional tools">        Additional tools include special commands for querying
auxiliary databases, on-line help, log files, etc.
More details can be found in the  Simbad  User&#8217;s Guide
or on the Web pages.</subsection></section><section title="User Interfaces to SIMBAD">      There are several user interfaces to  Simbad .
New users are advised to go directly to the WWW interface,
unless they have very specific needs.       </section><section title="SIMBAD usage"><subsection title="Charging policy">        Simbad  is a charged service. The  telnet access is protected by userid/password, and the WWW
access is protected either by IP address or by
password.         Users have to
register, and get a userid/password from the
CDS staff (or from the U.S. agent for American users).         In the U.S. there is no invoicing for the end-user
because the charges are covered globally
by NASA for all U.S. users.         In Europe, the same situation is also true for
users from ESO and ESA member states, thanks to an
agreement signed with
European Southern Observatory and
ESA Space Telescope European Coordinating
Facility (since January 1995).         Special arrangements also exist or are currently
being negotiated
with other countries, including Canada, Australia, and Japan.</subsection><subsection title="Usage statistics">        There are currently (November 1999) some 7000 user
accounts from 64 different countries.
The development of the WWW access makes difficult
to keep precise track of the individual usage statistics,
but the global statistics show that the world wide
interest for accessing the  Simbad  database continues
to increase regularly over the years.         The number of  Simbad  queries evolved
from about 30,000 per month in 1997
to about 100,000 per month in 1999.
About 50% of the queries come through
the client/server mode.         A mirror copy of  Simbad  has been established
at CfA (Harvard) for convenience
of US users, and about
one third of the queries are currently processed on
the mirror site (including name resolving activities for
the ADS and major US NASA archives).
The mirror copy is managed by CDS and updated
every night.</subsection></section><section title="SIMBAD updates and quality control"><subsection title="Updating SIMBAD">        Simbad  is kept up-to-date on a daily basis, as the
result of the collaboration of the CDS team, in Strasbourg,
with bibliographers
in
Observatoire de Paris (DASGAL),
Institut d&#8217;Astrophysique de Paris,
and
Observatoire de Bordeaux
(Lalo&#235; et al.&#160; ; Lalo&#235;  )
who systematically scan the articles published in some 100
astronomy journals.         The references are updated very soon after reception of the
journal issues, and in some cases directly from the journal
table of contents, through agreements with the Editors.
New data concerning the objects (identifiers,
basic data), and new acronyms for catalogs
or tables are being entered
when appropriate.         The inclusion of a large
catalogue in the database is often a long-term task which may
span over several months or
years; the collaboration of specialists in the different fields
is systematically sought.         The improvement of the  Simbad  astronomical contents
relies on a network of collaborations: a list of the
main current contributors is given in Table&#160; .
More generally, help of other contributing institutes
and authors, too numerous to be cited here,
is gratefully acknowledged.</subsection><subsection title="Quality control">        The data contained in  Simbad  are also
permanently updated, as a result of errata, remarks
from the bibliographers (during the scanning of the
literature), integration of lists
and catalogues, quality controls, or special
efforts initiated by the
CDS team to better cover some specific domains (e.g.,
multi-wavelength emitters and complex objects).         Requests for corrections, errata, or suggestions are
regularly received from  Simbad  users through a
dedicated  hot line , at e-mail address question@simbad.u-strasbg.fr .
A few dozens of messages are usually received every
week, and processed on a daily basis by the member of
the team who is on duty for that week, or transmitted
to the key person in case of specialized questions.
Remarks received from the users by this way are especially
welcome, as they help the CDS team to improve the database
contents through the scrutiny of specialists&#8217; eyes.         Developing new tools for quality control
of the database is a major challenge for the future,
and CDS is exploring possible solutions.
Multivariate analysis applied to
bibliographic information retrieval has
been proven a possible tool for developing quality control
in a database such as  Simbad  (Lesteven  ).</subsection><subsection title="Towards automation of updating procedures">        The advent of
electronic publishing brings new
perspectives for improvement and automation of the updating
procedures.         In a first place, tables of contents of the major journals are
now received electronically through the network,
thanks to journal Editors and Publishers,
thus reducing the risk of errors.
Regularly, a number of electronic lists of objects are also
folded into  Simbad through semi-automatic procedures.
The next step will be the
automatic flagging of object names in the text of
the articles: this has now become
a very interesting medium-term goal.         Two ways of achieving this flagging are
currently being considered:         The first approach seems safer, provided the authors
understand what exactly they are being required,
and accept this (minor) additional work load.
The latter implies a lot of fine tuning from
the system developers.
The current experience with the handling of publications
(Lesteven et al.&#160; )
suggests that both approaches may be needed, and that a careful
quality control, including final check by an expert, will
probably remain necessary to avoid errors or misinterpretations,
and to ensure appropriate completeness.</subsection></section><section title="Nomenclature"><subsection title="The Dictionary of Nomenclature">        Designations of astronomical objects are often confusing.
A complete list of astronomical designations
has been collected and published by Lortet et al.&#160;( ) in the Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects
outside the Solar System .         This information is available on-line through the  info command, or on the
WWW .
This service is the electronic look-up version of the Dictionary  which is now under the responsibility
of CDS. It is kept up-to-date on a weekly
basis; about 15 new acronyms
are incorporated every week.         The  Dictionary  currently provides full references
and usages about some 5000 different acronyms.
It is used by the International
Astronomical Union as a reference for its recommendations
related to nomenclature.</subsection><subsection title="The   module">        The   module
is used inside  Simbad for the management of possible variations in the
naming of astronomical objects.
It is based on a list of rules, written as regular expressions,
allowing translation of the submitted name
into its  Simbad  canonical form; it is only made visible to
the user when a message mentions the submitted syntax
and its translation.         There are cases where ambiguities cannot be solved.
This is actually specific to the broad context of  Simbad .
Let us give an example: in the context of extragalactic
objects &#8216;N&#8217; is a possible abbreviation for &#8216;NGC&#8217;
(accepted by NED);
but people studying Novae would frequently use
&#8216;N&#8217; as an abbreviation for Nova, people studying
H  ii  regions would use it for naming
nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds (LHA 120-N or LHA 115-N),
and &#8216;N&#8217; has also been found in the literature for cluster
stars studied by Nordlund in NGC 2099 (Cl* NGC 2099 N),
for stars studied by Neckel ([N78]), or even for &#8216;New&#8217;
parts of the galaxy NGC 1275 ([NJS93] in  Simbad ).
When a name like &#8216;N&#160;1992&#8217; is submitted
to  Simbad  the ambiguity cannot be solved without
requesting additional information from the user.</subsection></section><section title="Integration of SIMBAD into the CDS Hub">      While the CDS databases have followed different
development paths, the
need to build a transparent access
to the whole set of CDS services has become
more and more obvious with the easy
navigation permitted by hypertext tools
(Genova et al.&#160; ). Aladin  has become the prototype of such a development,
by giving comprehensive simultaneous
access to  Simbad ,
the  VizieR  Catalogue service,
and to external databases such as NED,
using a client/server approach and, when possible,
standardized query syntax and formats.       In order to be able to go further, the
CDS has built a general data
exchange model, taking into account all types of information available
at the Data Center, known under the acronym
of GLU for G&#233;n&#233;rateur de Liens Uniformes &#8211; Uniform
Link Generator (Fernique et al.&#160; ).       In the current stage of development, the WWW interface
to  Simbad  provides access to  Aladin previewer (reference image around one object),
and to the  Aladin  interactive Java program
(see Bonnarel et al.&#160; ).
There are also links between  Simbad  and the
bibliographic services developed or mirrored
at CDS, and more generally to the ADS and the
electronic journals.       While this article is written stronger links between  Simbad  and VizieR  are just being created allowing even easier transfers
of data and information between both services.
This will also make easier to build new links pointing to
distributed data archives, beyond those already existing
(currently: IUE/INES and HEASARC).</section><section title="Future developments">      In the near future, the CDS team expects to go on enriching
the database contents and system functionality.
The users play an important role in
that respect, by giving feedback on the desired features,
on the user-friendliness of the interfaces, etc.       In the context of interoperability of distributed services,
as currently discussed within the ISAIA project
(Interoperable Systems for Archival
Information Access; Hanisch  ), Simbad  is prepared to deliver
resource profiles and to format the query outputs
in a standard way, for instance XML
(Ochsenbein et al.  ).       As larger and larger astronomical datasets are being
produced, the CDS is studying the concepts of a new
generation database of several billion objects,
instead of the current several million objects.
We expect  Simbad  to remain an essential
tool for astronomical research in the years to come.</section></document>
