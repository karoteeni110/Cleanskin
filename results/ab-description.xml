  <title>Comprehensive analysis of large   yields observed in  Li induced reactions 
  </title><abstract>
     
       
         Background:
          Large   yields have been reported over the years in reactions with  Li and  Li projectiles. Previous theoretical analyses have shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup leaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small fraction of the total   inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing toward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms. 
         
      
       
         Purpose:
          We aim to provide a systematic study of the   inclusive cross sections observed in nuclear reactions induced by  Li projectiles. In addition to estimating the total   singles cross sections, it is our goal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these   particles and compare with experimental data, when available. 
         
      
       
         Method:
          We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive breakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For the NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura, Austern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C32, 432 (1982)], within the DWBA approximation. 
         
      
       
         Results:
          Overall, the sum of the computed EBU and NEB cross sections is found to reproduce very well the measured singles cross sections. In all cases analyzed, we find that the inclusive breakup cross section is largely dominated by the NEB component. 
         
      
       
         Conclusions:
          The presented method provides a global and systematic description of inclusive breakup reactions induced by  Li projectiles. It provides also a natural explanation of the previously observed underestimation of the measured   yields by CDCC calculations. The method used here can be extended to other weakly-bound projectiles, including halo nuclei.

      Reactions induced by the  Li nucleus have been extensively studied
giving rise to a large body of experimental data at present. Given its
marked   structure, with a separation energy
of   MeV (to be compared with the single nucleon
separation energy of 5.39 MeV), one may anticipate that the breakup of this nucleus into
  and   is a major reaction channel. In fact, experimental data
show remarkably large yields of   particles but, contrary to what
naively expected, these yields are typically much larger than the
corresponding   yields. This suggests that the breakup of the
 Li is not a simple direct breakup mechanism. 
     
      From the theoretical point of view, a proper interpretation of these
  yields is still lacking. Continuum-discretized coupled-channels
(CDCC) calculations, which treat the  Li breakup as an inelastic excitation to
the continuum, reproduce successfully the coincidence   measurements  
but they largely underestimate the inclusive   cross sections.
It is worthwhile recalling that the CDCC method provides only the so-called
 elastic breakup  (EBU) component of the total breakup cross section.
For the reaction of a   (EBU) component of the total breakup cross section.
For the reaction of a  Li projectile impinging on a target  , this
corresponds to the processes of the form   in
which the two-projectile clusters survive after the collision and the
target remains in the ground state.  If a three-body description of the  Li is used,  +p+n, the three-body breakup mode
  would be also part of the elastic breakup channel. Since we resort here
to a two-body model of  Li we include this channel in the NEB part. Thus, the underestimation of the
inclusive  Thus, the underestimation of the
inclusive   yields by the CDCC calculations means that there other
mechanisms contributing to the inclusive breakup cross section other than the EBU. These
include the exchange of nucleons between   and  , the projectile
dissociation accompanied by target excitation, and the fusion of   by
 , among others, that we will globally denote as  non-elastic breakup  (NEB) channels.
An explicit account of these process is very challenging due to the huge
number of accessible final states and the variety of competing different
mechanisms.  (NEB) channels.
An explicit account of these process is very challenging due to the huge
number of accessible final states and the variety of competing different
mechanisms. 
     
      When one is only interested in the evaluation of the singles cross section
(for example, the energy or angular distribution of   particles),
rather than on the separate contributing mechanisms, one may resort to
the inclusive breakup models proposed in the 1980s and recently reexamined
by several groups  . In these models, the
sum over all the possible final states through which the unobserved fragment
  may interact with the target is done in a formal way, making use of
the Feshbach projection formalism   and closure. 
     
      In this work, we will show that inclusive   singles cross sections from
 Li-induced reactions can be remarkably well reproduced using the
inclusive breakup model proposed by Ichimura, Austern and Vincent (IAV)  .
To our knowledge, this is the first study of this kind providing a
systematic explanation of these data. 
     
      Although the IAV model provides a common formalism for the calculation
of the elastic and non-elastic breakup components of the inclusive breakup
cross section, in our analysis we will employ this model only for the NEB
part, whereas for the EBU part we will use the continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats breakup to all orders. 
     
      The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.&#160; 
we give a short overview of the IAV theory, highlighting only its main formulas.
In Sec.&#160;  the extension of the formalism to negative
deuteron energies (bound states) is discussed.
In Sec.&#160; , the formalism is
applied to describe the   cross sections in several  Li-induced reactions comparing with the available data.
In Sec.&#160;  the role of the transfer channels on the NEB cross section is discussed.
In Sec.&#160;  we investigate the systematic behaviour of the
inclusive cross section with respect to the incident energy and for all analyzed targets.
Finally, in Sec.&#160;  we summarize the main results of this work. 
    </section><section title=" The Ichimura, Austern, Vincent (IAV) model  &#10;    ">
      In this section we briefly summarize the model of Ichimura,
Austern and Vincent (IAV), whose original derivation can be found
in  , and has been also recently revisited by several
authors  . We outline here the main results
of this model, and refer the reader to these references for further
details on their derivations. 
     
      We write the process under study in the form, 
      where the projectile  , composed of   and  , collides with a target  , emitting   fragments and any other fragments. Thus,   denotes any final state of the   system. 
     
      This process will be described with the effective Hamiltonian 
      where   is the total kinetic energy operator,   is the
interaction binding the two clusters   and   in the initial
composite nucleus  ,   is the Hamiltonian of the target
nucleus (with   denoting its internal coordinates) and   and
  are the fragment&#8211;target interactions. The relevant coordinates are depicted in Fig.&#160; . 
     
      In writing the Hamiltonian of the system in the form ( ) we
make a clear distinction between the two cluster constituents; the
interaction of the fragment  , the one that is assumed to be observed
in the experiment, is described with a (complex) optical potential. Non-elastic
processes arising from this interaction (e.g.&#160;target excitation),
are included only effectively through  . The particle   is said
to act as  spectator . On the other hand, the interaction of
the particle  . On the other hand, the interaction of
the particle   with the target retains the dependence of the target degrees of freedom
( ). 
     
      Starting from Hamiltonian ( ) IAV derived the following expression for the double differential cross section for the NEB with respect to the
angle and energy of the   fragments: 
      where   is the projectile-target relative velocity,
  is the density of states
for the particle  ,   is the imaginary part of the optical
potential describing   elastic scattering and
  is the so-called  -channel
wave function, which governs the evolution of   after the projectile
dissociation, when   scatters with momentum   and the
target remains in the ground state. This function satisfies the following
inhomogeneous differential equation 
      where  ,   is the distorted-wave describing the
scattering of   in the final channel with respect to the  + 
sub-system, and  
(with   the optical potential in the final channel) is the post-form
transition operator. The notation   indicates integration over the   coordinte only. This equation is to be solved with outgoing boundary conditions. 
     
      Austern  et al.      suggest approximating the three-body wave
function appearing in the source term of Eq.&#160;( ),  ,
by the CDCC one. Since the CDCC wave function is also a complicated object
by itself, a simpler choice is to use the DWBA approximation, i.e.,
 ,
where   is a distorted wave describing   elastic
scattering and   is the projectile ground state wave function. 
     
      The IAV model has been recently revisited by several groups  .
All the calculations performed so far by these groups make use of the
DWBA approximation for the incoming wave function.
In Refs.&#160; , the theory was applied to deuteron induced
reactions of the form  , and in Ref.&#160;  the model was
extended to  Li projectiles, presenting a first application to
the  Bi( Li, ) reaction.
In general, the agreement with the data has been found to be
very encouraging, although further comparisons with experimental data
are advisable to better assess the validity and limitations of the model. 
    </section><section title=" Extension of IAV model to  &#10;    ">
      The sort of breakup cross section considered by Ichimura, Austern and Vincent can be
regarded as transfer to continuum process populating   states with positive relative energy ( ). In general, the inclusive cross section will contain also
contributions coming from the population of states below the breakup   threshold ( ). For example, in a ( Li,  ) reaction, the  &#8217;s
emitted at the higher energies will actually correspond to deuteron transfer to bound states of the
target nucleus. One would like to have a common framework to describe transfer to continuum states
as well as to bound states. The explicit inclusion of all possible final bound states is
unpractical because of their large number and the uncertainties in their spin/parity
assignments and spectroscopic factors. An alternative procedure was proposed by Udagawa and co-workers  .
The key idea is to extend the complex potential to negative energies. Then, the bound states of the system are simulated by the eigenstates in this complex
potential. The imaginary part will be associated with the spreading width of the single-particle
states, which accounts for the fragmentation of these states into more complicated configurations
due to the residual interactions. The method has been recently reexamined by
Potel  et al.     , who have provided an efficient implementation of this idea. Here, we closely follow their formulation. For that, we first rewrite Eq.&#160;( ) in integral form 
      where  
is the source term of the inhomogeneous Eq.&#160;( ) and
  is the Green&#8217;s function 
      where   satisfies the equation 
      As usual, the solution of this equation is obtained from the regular ( ) and irregular ( )
solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. From these two solutions,   can be expressed as 
      where   is the lesser value of   and   and   is the larger one.
The normalization constant   can be found by
integrating Eq.&#160;( ) over an infinitesimal interval around
 
      Where   denotes a Wronskian, which is independent of the value of  . 
     
      It is worth noting that the integral form of the  channel wave function ( ) can be also be used for positive   energies. Proceeding in this way, the application of the IAV formalism to positive and negative energies is formally analogous. Despite this formal similitude, the interpretation of the channel function and of the underlying imaginary part of the potential is somewhat different in both regions. For   the channel function   describes   elastic scattering and the imaginary part is therefore associated with the flux leaving this channel in favor of non-elastic channels. For  , the channel wave-function describes the motion of the   particle in a bound single-particle configuration state of the residual nucleus, and the imaginary part is connected with the spreading width of this configuration, which accounts for the fragmentation of these
states into more complicated configurations. The connection between both regimes becomes more transparent within a dispersive formulation of the optical potential, as suggested long ago by Mahoux and Sartor   and recently reexamined by several groups (see e.g.&#160; ). 
    </section><section title=" Comparison with experimental data  &#10;    ">
      In this section, we compare the formalism with existing  Li inclusive breakup data on different targets. The  Li nucleus is treated in a two-cluster model ( + ), with   and   playing the roles of spectator and participant in the IAV model, respectively. 
     
      The elastic breakup (EBU) contribution of the inclusive breakup cross section is evaluated with the CDCC method  , using the coupled-channels code  FRESCO     .
In this method, the breakup is treated as an inelastic excitation to the continuum states of the projectile.
Although four-body CDCC calculations for  Li scattering have become
recently available  , we rely here on the more conventional
  di-cluster model. Thus, diagonal and off-diagonal coupling potentials
are generated from the  +target and  +target interactions, evaluated
at 2/3 and 1/3 of the projectile incident energy, respectively.
In order to reproduce correctly the elastic scattering data, CDCC
calculations based on this two-body model typically require some renormalization
of the fragment-target potentials  . This has been recently found to be a consequence of the shortcomings of the two-body description of the  Li nucleus, which results in an effective suppression of the deuteron-target absorption  . In our previous work  , we found that this effect could be well simulated by removing the surface part of the deuteron-target optical potential. In the calculations presented in this work, we also allow for such kind of modification, in order to reproduce
correctly the elastic scattering data. 
     
      For the   potential, we use the potential model from
Ref.&#160; , which contains both central and spin-orbit terms, with
the latter required to place correctly the   resonances. 
     
      For the non-elastic breakup calculations, we rely also on a   model, but the spin of the deuteron is ignored, since our current implementation of the IAV model ignores the intrinsic spin of the fragments. This approximation was also used in our previous works  . 
    <subsection title=" Pb ( Li,  )  &#10;      ">
        First, the results for the reaction  Pb( Li, ), at several
energies between 29 and 39 MeV are presented, comparing with the data from Refs.&#160; .
The nominal Coulomb barrier for this system is around 29.5 MeV  . The
CDCC calculations use the same structure model and bin discretization as
in our previous calculations for  Li+ Bi  . The  Pb and  Pb optical
potentials are taken from Refs.&#160;  and  ,
respectively. To improve the reproduction of the elastic data, the surface term of the imaginary
part of the  Pb potential was removed. For the NEB calculations,
the optical potential of  Li+ Pb is taken from Ref.&#160; . 
       
        Figure   shows the comparison of the calculated and
experimental angular distributions of   particles produced in
this reaction at the measured incident energies.
The squares and circles are the experimental data from
Refs.&#160;  and  , respectively. It is evident
that there is an appreciable difference between the two sets of data.
The dashed and dotted lines are the EBU (CDCC) and NEB (IAV model) results. As in the
 Li+ Bi case  , the NEB is found to account for most of the inclusive breakup
cross section. The sum EBU+NEB (TBU) reproduces reasonably well the magnitude and shape
of the data of Ref.&#160; , except for some overestimation for the lowest energies. Thus, our calculations clearly favour the data
presented in Ref.&#160;  over those presented in  . 
       
        From the results shown here and in Ref.&#160; , it
can be concluded that the nonelastic breakup
process is the dominant  emitting channel
in the  Li induced reactions on heavy targets. To investigate
whether this conclusion is a general feature of  Li induced reactions
or it holds only for heavy targets we extend our analysis to lighter targets. 
      </subsection><subsection title=" Tb ( Li,  ) &#10;      ">
        This reaction has been measured by
Pradhan  et al.      at several energies between 23 MeV and 35 MeV. 
       
        In Ref.&#160; , the following processes were invoked to explain the observed   yields:
(i) breakup of  Li into   and   fragments where both
fragments escape without being captured by the target, referred to in some works as non-capture
breakup; (ii)   particles resulting from   capture
by the target ( deuteron incomplete fusion ), following the breakup of  ), following the breakup of  Li into  
and   or a deuteron transfer to the target; (iii)
single-proton stripping from  Li to produce the unbound  He nucleus that decays
into an   particle and a neutron; (iv) single-neutron stripping from
 Li to produce  Li, which will subsequently decay
into an  +p; and (v) single-neutron pickup
from  Li to produce  Li, which breaks into an   particle
and a triton if  Li is excited above its breakup threshold of 2.468 MeV. In Ref.&#160;  these processes were treated separately, using several reaction formalisms and their sum reasonably reproduced the total  particle cross
sections, but not their angular distributions. 
       
        Within the inclusive breakup model adopted here,
the processes discussed by Pradhan  et al. &#160; &#160; 
can be re-defined as follows: process (i) can be divided into
two parts. First, the non-capture breakup with the target
remaining in its ground state, i.e., EBU. Second, the non-capture breakup
accompanied by target excitation, which we call  inelastic breakup  and
is part of our   and
is part of our  non-elastic breakup  cross section;
processes (ii)-(iv) may be also embedded in the NEB part, in which the deuteron
is absorbed by the target or it breaks up into   cross section;
processes (ii)-(iv) may be also embedded in the NEB part, in which the deuteron
is absorbed by the target or it breaks up into   following
the breakup of  Li into   and  ;
it can also happen that after the breakup of  Li, the deuteron picks
a neutron to become a tritium, contributing to the process (v).
Processes (ii)-(v) as well as the inelastic breakup can be considered as
nonelastic breakup and should be therefore accounted by the IAV formalism. 
       
        Elastic data for this reaction are not available. Thus, the CDCC
calculation is tested against the data for the nearby system  Li+ Sm  .
The  Sm and  Sm optical potentials were taken from Refs.&#160;  and  , respectively. The optical model calculation using the potential of
Cook   (dashed lines) is also shown. It can be seen that the
CDCC result is similar to the optical model calculation, particularly at
  MeV. At this energy, the calculations reproduce very well the elastic
data. For the lower energy ( &#160;MeV), both calculations underestimate the data at
backward angles. Note that, in contrast to the  Li+ Pb case, no apparent modification of the deuteron potential was required in this case. 
       
        Now the inclusive breakup cross sections  Tb( Li, )
are discussed. The EBU contribution was obtained from the CDCC calculations
discussed in the previous paragraph. For the NEB calculation,
the same optical potentials  Tb were
used. The Cook potential   was used to calculate
the distorted wave of the incoming channel. 
       
        In Fig.&#160;  the calculated and experimental angular distributions
of   particles are compared for several incident energies of  Li.
The dashed and dotted lines are the EBU (CDCC) and NEB (IAV model) results.
The summed EBU + NEB cross sections (solid lines) reproduce fairly well the shape and magnitude of the data,
except for a slight overestimation at some energies.
Similarly to the heavy-target systems, i.e.,  Li+ Bi   and
 Li+ Pb (Sec.&#160; ), the NEB is found to account for most of the
inclusive breakup cross section. 
      </subsection><subsection title=" Sn ( Li,  ) &#10;      ">
        Inclusive breakup data for the  Sn( Li,  ) reaction are available in Ref.&#160;  at energies
between 18 and 24 MeV. The optical
model parameterizations of Refs.&#160;  and   are used for the  Sn
and  Sn systems. For the NEB
calculations, the optical potential of  Li+ Sn is taken from
Ref.&#160; . 
       
        In Fig.&#160;  we compare the elastic data with the CDCC (solid lines) and optical model (dashed lines) calculations. Overall, both types of calculations reproduce
well the data, with some discrepancy observed at 18 and 21 MeV. 
       
        Figure   shows the comparison of the calculated and
experimental angular distributions of   particles produced in this
reaction, for several incident energies.
Again, the
NEB part (dotted lines) accounts for most of the inclusive breakup cross section and the
EBU (dashed lines) becomes the dominant breakup mode for angles smaller than  50 degrees. The
summed EBU + NEB result (solid line) reproduces remarkably well the shape and
magnitude of the data. 
      </subsection><subsection title=" Co ( Li,  ) &#10;      ">
        Experimental data for the  -production channel for the reaction  Li+ Co have been reported
by Souza  et al. &#160; &#160;  at   MeV, which is above the Coulomb barrier (  MeV). 
       
        Elastic data are available at the somewhat smaller energy   MeV   so we first compare these data with the optical
model and CDCC calculations. For the former, we employed the global optical potential of Cook  . For the CDCC calculations,
the optical potentials for
 Co and  Co were taken from Refs.&#160;  and
 , respectively. The results are shown in Fig.&#160; .
It can be seen that both the CDCC and optical model calculations reproduce fairly
well the data.
We notice that no renormalization of the deuteron potential was required
in this case. 
       
        The experimental and calculated angular distributions of inclusive   particles are shown in Fig.&#160; . The NEB is seen to dominate the inclusive
  production.
It should be noticed that, in this case, the NEB part includes also the
transfer populating bound states of the target, which was obtained
using the formalism discussed in Sec.&#160; . A more detailed discussion
of this contribution is left for Sec.&#160; .
The total cross section, TBU= EBU + NEB, reproduces well
the shape of the experimental data, although the magnitude is underestimated by
 30% at the maximum. This might indicate the presence of other
relevant mechanisms leading to the production of   particles in this reaction, such as the formation of a compound nucleus followed by   evaporation. In fact, statistical model calculations performed in Ref.&#160;  predicted a significant amount of   particles coming from this channel. The evaluation of this contribution is beyond the scope of the present work. 
       
        The energy spectra for selected   scattering angles are also available for this reaction. These are compared with our calculations in Fig.&#160; , with each panel corresponding to a given   scattering angle, as indicated by the labels.
Except at  , the sum of EBU and NEB reproduces
the peak of the   energy distribution.
However, the low-energy tail is clearly underestimated. At these energies, the
main contribution of the inclusive   production may arise from
compound nucleus followed by evaporation and pre-equilibrium, which are not
considered in the present calculations.
We note that high energy   particles stem from a deuteron
transfer mechanism to the target and are well reproduced by our calculations. 
      </subsection><subsection title=" Ni ( Li,  ) &#10;      ">
        The   production of the  Li +  Ni reaction at several incident
energies between 12 MeV and 20 MeV was measured by Pfeiffer  et al. 
 
 . Elastic scattering data, which were also measured, are compared with CDCC
and OM calculations in Fig.&#160;  (note that the angles and cross sections are referred to the laboratory frame, as in the original reference). For the former, we use the same optical potentials as in the nearby  Li+ Co case. For the OM calculations we use the global OM potential by Cook  .
Both calculations reproduce rather well the data, although the CDCC calculations slightly underestimates the data at large angles. 
       
        We present now the inclusive alpha cross sections.
For the NEB calculation, the  Li optical potential from
Ref.&#160;  was used. Figure   shows the comparison
of the calculated and experimental angular distributions of  
particles produced in this reaction, for several incident
energies.
Notice that the NEB (dotted lines) includes also the contribution coming from the transfer to target bound states.
Again, the NEB part dominates the inclusive   production. In general, the summed EBU + NEB cross section (solid lines)
reproduces well the shape and magnitude of the data. At  ,   and   MeV some underestimation is observed, which might be associated with other  -production channels, as pointed out in the  Li+ Co case. 
       
        From the results presented in the previous sections, we may conclude that
the strong  -production channel observed in  Li experiments
originates mostly from non-elastic breakup mechanisms. In all cases analyzed, the EBU mode turns out to account for a relatively small fraction
of the total inclusive alpha cross section and its contribution is only
important for the alpha particles emitted at small angles. For the lighter targets, we found also
a indirect evidence of other alpha production mechanisms, such as
fusion. 
      </subsection></section><section title=" Transfer content of the NEB cross section &#10;    ">
      The relative importance of the transfer to bound states within the NEB cross section will depend on several parameters,
such as the projectile incident energy a
nd the charge of the target nucleus.
For heavy targets, the transfer channel is suppressed due to the
strong Coulomb interaction between the deuteron and the target, whereas for light targets this channel is expected to play a more important role. 
     
      This is illustrated in Fig.&#160;  for two such cases; the upper panel displays the
calculated  Pb( Li,  X) NEB cross sections as a function of
 - Pb relative energy
at three different incident energies,
29 MeV, 35 MeV and 39 MeV. The vertical dotted line indicates
the nominal Coulomb barrier for the  - Pb system. The black solid curve is the reaction cross section for the  - Pb system, arbitrarily normalized to fit within the same scale. The bottom panel shows similar curves for the  Li+ Ni reaction at 12, 16 and 20 MeV. In both cases, it can be seen that the
NEB is a  Trojan Horse  type process   type process  , which means that the  Li projectile
brings the deuteron inside the Coulomb barrier and let it interact with the target nucleus, giving a sizable cross sections for deuteron energies for which the reaction cross section has already become negligibly small.
For the  Pb target, due to the strong Coulomb repulsion, the NEB cross section becomes
negligible at negative  - Pb relative energies and this behavior is
independent of the incoming  Li energy. By contrary, for the  Ni target, there is a low energy tail extending to negative deuteron
energies (transfer). 
     
      We expect also some correlation between the  -particle angular and energy distribution. This is shown in Fig.&#160;  in the form of contour plots of double differential cross sections and angle-integrated cross section as a function of the outgoing   energy in the c.m.&#160;frame for the reactions
(a)  Li+ Pb, (b)  Li+ Tb, (c)  Li+ Sn and
(d)  Li+ Co. It can seen that the most energetic   particles are preferably emitted at forward angles, whereas those with lower energies contribute to both forward and backward angles. Moreover,
when the charge of the target is small ( Co), the transfer
channel becomes more relevant. 
    </section><section title=" Systematics of inclusive   production  &#10;    ">
      Systematic studies of   production yields in  Li reactions
show an interesting universal behaviour when plotted as a function of
the incident energy scaled by the Coulomb
barrier energy as reported for instance by Pakou  et al. &#160; &#160; . In this section, we
will investigate whether our calculations exhibit also this universal behaviour.
For this study, we have considered the target systems  Co,  Sn,  Tb,
 Pb, which have been analyzed in the preceding sections, and  Bi, analyzed in Ref.&#160; .
The results are shown in Fig.&#160; ,
where we plot the calculated   cross sections
as a function of the reduced energy
( ), with   the energy of the
Coulomb barrier, estimated as  ,
where   ( ) and   ( ) are the atomic number and atomic mass
of the projectile (target), respectively, and   fm.
As expected, the breakup cross section drops quickly as the incident energy decreases below the barrier. This effect is enhanced for the
 Bi nucleus, possibly due to the larger Coulomb repulsion.
Above the barrier, the medium-heavy and
heavy targets the inclusive breakup cross sections
show a similar trend, but not for the medium mass targets  Ni and  Co at larger energies.
We recall however that, for these lighter systems, there might be
additional contributions from other channels, such as compound nucleus
following evaporation, which are not accounted for by the IAV formalism. 
     
      We have also studied the relative importance of EBU versus NEB as a function
of the incident energy. For that, we display in
Fig.&#160;  the ratio of EBU over TBU (= EBU + NEB) for the analyzed systems.
It is seen that, for incident energies below
the Coulomb barrier, the elastic breakup cross section becomes comparatively more important as
the energy decreases. This can be attributed to the fact that, below the barrier, the breakup takes place at large projectile-target separations, and the deuteron absorption (responsible for the NEB part) will be less important  . By contrast, for energies above the Coulomb barrier,
the ratio shows an almost constant behavior.
It can also be seen that, while for the heavy mass targets elastic
breakup plays an important role in the inclusive   production,
especially below the Coulomb barrier, for the medium mass targets elastic
breakup is less important and the nonelastic breakup is dominant. 
     
      Another relevant question regards the fraction of the reaction cross section that is exhausted by the   cross section. To address this question,
we plot in Fig.&#160;  the ratio of the calculated TBU and reaction cross sections as a function of the reduced energy  , for the systems studied in this work. Several interesting features emerge from this plot: (i) first, for all systems analyzed the ratio decreases smoothly as the incident energy increases; (ii) second, the heavier the target nucleus, the larger the ratio. For example, for the  Pb and  Bi target nuclei the ratio exceeds 80% at sub-Coulomb energies. Result (i) may be understood as a consequence of the competition with other channels which will open and increase their importance as the incident energy increases, such as other breakup modes not associated with the production of   particles (e.g.  H+ He), target excitation not accompanied by projectile breakup, neutron pickup from the target, etc.

      To summarize, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of inclusive breakup cross sections in  Li-induced reactions with the aim of understanding the experimentally observed   yields. For that, we have calculated separately the EBU and NEB contributions using the CDCC method (for the EBU part) and the closed-form model proposed by Ichimura, Austern and Vincent IAV theory (for the NEB part). For the latter model, we used the DWBA approximation, including finite-range effects and the remnant term of the transition operator. 
     
      Overall, the calculations show a very good agreement with the available data, providing a consistent and neat explanation of the large   yields reported over the years for  Li reactions, without the need of evaluating the individual channels contributing to the inclusive cross section.
Furthermore, in all cases analyzed, the total   breakup is largely dominated by the NEB part, with the EBU part representing only a small fraction of the total inclusive cross section. This explains why the CDCC calculations tend to largely underpredict the measured   yields. The EBU becomes only dominant at very small angles, or at energies well below the Coulomb barrier. For the heavy target systems, the   singles cross section accounts for a large fraction of the reaction cross section (above 80% at sub-Coulomb energies).
For the lighter mass targets, we found that part of the   yields corresponds to transfer to bound states of the residual nucleus. To account for this contribution, the IAV model has been conveniently extended, following the formalism developed by previous authors  . 
     
      Finally, we have investigated whether our calculations support the observed universal trend of   yields as a function of the reduced incident energy ( ). We find that the computed total breakup cross sections (EBU+NEB) exhibit this trend for the heavy targets, but significant deviations have been found for the light
targets. This could indicate that the latter do not obey the universal
behavior, but we cannot rule out that the deviations are due to the presence of
additional   production mechanisms, not included in our calculations.
This problem deserves further investigation.
