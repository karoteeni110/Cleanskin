  <abstract>The reconstruction of the Higgs potential in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) requires the measurement of the
trilinear Higgs self-couplings. The &#8216;double Higgs production&#8217;
subgroup has been investigating the possibility of detecting
signatures of processes carrying a dependence on these vertices at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future Linear Colliders (LCs).
As reference reactions, we have chosen   and  , respectively, where   is the lightest of the MSSM Higgs
bosons. In both cases, the   interaction is involved. For , the two reactions are resonant in the  mode, providing cross sections which are detectable at both
accelerators and strongly sensitive to the strength of the trilinear
coupling involved. We explore this mass regime of the MSSM in the  decay channel, also accounting for irreducible
background effects.</abstract><para>    DESY 99-192 RAL-TR-99-083 February 2000</para><para>    Double Higgs production at TeV Colliders [0.35cm]

production at future   and hadron colliders, both in the
Standard Model (SM) and the MSSM (see Refs.&#160;  for
an incomplete list of references for SM   and hadron colliders,
respectively, and similarly   for the MSSM).
For the SM,
detailed signal-to-background studies already exist for a LC
environment  , for both &#8216;reducible&#8217; and &#8216;irreducible&#8217;
backgrounds  , which have assessed the feasibility of
experimental analyses. At the LHC, since here the typical SM signal
cross sections are of the order of 10 fb  , high integrated
luminosities would be needed to generate a statistically large enough
sample of double Higgs events. These would be further obscured by an
overwhelming background, making their selection and analysis in a
hadronic environment extremely difficult. Thus, in this contribution we will
concentrate only on the case of the MSSM.       In the Supersymmetric (SUSY) scenario, the phenomenological potential
of these reactions is two-fold. Firstly, in some specific cases, they
can furnish new discovery channels for Higgs bosons. Secondly, they
are all dependent upon several triple Higgs self-couplings of the theory,
which can then be tested by comparing theoretical predictions with
experimental measurements. This is the first step in the
reconstruction of the Higgs potential itself .       The Higgs Working Group (WG) has focused much of its attention in assessing
the viability of these reactions at future TeV colliders. However, the
number of such processes is very large both at the LHC and a LC , so only a few &#8216;reference&#8217; reactions could be studied in
the context of this Workshop. Work is in progress for the
longer term, which aims to cover most of the double Higgs production
and decay phenomenology at both accelerators&#160; .       These reference reactions were chosen to be   for the LHC
(see top of Fig.&#160; ) and   for the LC
(see bottom of Fig.&#160; ), where   is the lightest of the
MSSM scalar Higgs bosons. The reason for this preference is simple.
Firstly, a stable upper limit exists on the value of  , of the
order of 130 GeV, now at two-loop level  , so that
its detection is potentially well within the reach of both the LHC and
a LC. In contrast, the mass of all other Higgs bosons of the MSSM may
vary from the electroweak (EW) scale,  , up to the TeV
region. In addition, as noted in Ref.&#160; , the multi-  final
state in  , with two resonances and large
transverse momenta, may be exploited in the search for the   scalar
in the large   and moderate   region. This is a corner
of the MSSM parameter space that has so far eluded the scope of the
standard Higgs production and decay modes  . (The
symbol   here denotes the pseudoscalar Higgs boson of the MSSM, and
we reserve the notation   for the heaviest scalar Higgs state of the
model.)
However, this paper will not investigate the LHC discovery potential
in this mode, given the very sophisticated treatment of the background
(well beyond the scope of this note) required by the assumption
that no   scalar state has been previously discovered (see below).
This will be done in Ref.&#160; . Furthermore, the  and   modes largely dominate double Higgs production , at least for centre-of-mass (CM) energies of 14 TeV
at the LHC and 500 GeV in the case of a LC, the default values of
our analysis. (Notice that we assume no
polarization of the incoming beams in   scatterings.)
Finally, when  , the two reactions are
resonant, as they can both proceed via intermediate states involving  scalars, through   and  , which in turn decay
via    . Thus, the production cross sections are
largely enhanced   (up to two orders of magnitude above
typical SM rates at the LHC  ) and become clearly visible.
This allows the possibility of probing the
trilinear   vertex at one or both these colliders.       The dominant decay rate of the MSSM   scalar is into  pairs, regardless of the value of    . Therefore,
the final signatures of our reference reactions always involve four -quarks in the final state. (In the case of a LC environment, a
further trigger on the accompanying   boson can be exploited.)       If one assumes very efficient tagging and high-purity sampling of -quarks, the background to   events at the LHC is dominated by
the irreducible QCD modes  . Among these, we focus here
on the cases  , as representative of
ideal  -tagging performances. These modes
consist of a purely QCD contribution
of  , an entirely EW process of   (with no double
Higgs intermediate states) and an  component consisting of EW and QCD interactions. (Note that in the EW
case only   initiated subprocesses are allowed at tree-level.)
For a LC, the final state of the signal is  , with
the   reconstructed from its decay products in some channel. Here, the EW
background is of   away from resonances
(and, again, contains no more than one intermediate Higgs boson), whereas
the EW/QCD background is proportional to  .       In general, EW backgrounds can be problematic due to the presence of  vectors and single Higgs scalars yielding   pairs, with
the partons being typically at large transverse momenta and well separated. In
contrast, the QCD backgrounds involve no heavy objects decaying to   pairs and are dominated by the typical infrared (i.e., soft
and collinear) QCD behaviour of the partons in the final state.
However, they can yield large production rates because of the strong
couplings. fd       In this study, we investigate the interplay between the signal and
background at both colliders, adopting detector as well as dedicated
selection cuts. We carry out our analysis at both parton and hadron
level. The plan of this note is as follows. The next Section details
the procedure adopted in the numerical computation.
Sect.&#160;  displays our results and contains our
discussion. Finally, in the last section, we summarise our findings
and consider possible future studies.</section><section title="Calculation">      For the parton level simulation, the double Higgs production process
at the LHC, via   fusion, has been simulated using the program
of Ref.&#160;  to generate the interaction  ,
with the matrix elements (MEs) taken at leading-order (LO) for consistency
with our treatment of the background. We then
perform the two   decays to obtain the actual  -final
state. For double Higgs production at a LC, we use a source
code for the signal derived from that already used in Ref.&#160; .
At both colliders,
amplitudes for background events were generated by means of MadGraph  and the  HELAS  package  . Note that
interferences between signal and backgrounds, and between the various
background contributions themselves, have been neglected. This is a
good approximation for the interferences involving the signal because
of the very narrow width of the MSSM lightest Higgs boson. Similarly,
the various background subprocesses have very different topologies,
and one would expect their interferences to be small in general.       The Higgs boson masses and couplings of the MSSM can be expressed at
tree-level in terms of the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs state, , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral
fields in the two iso-doublets,  .
At higher order however, top and stop
loop-effects can become significant. Radiative corrections in the
one-loop leading   approximation are parameterised by where the SUSY breaking scale is given by the common squark mass, , set equal to  &#160;TeV in the numerical analysis. If stop mixing
effects are modest at the SUSY scale, they can be accounted for by
shifting   in   by the amount  (  is the trilinear common coupling).
The charged and neutral CP-even Higgs boson
masses, and the Higgs mixing angle   are given in this
approximation by the relations: as a function of   and  . The triple Higgs self-couplings of
the MSSM can be parameterised   in units
of  ,   GeV, as,       Next-to-leading order (NLO) effects are certainly dominant, though the
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ones cannot entirely be neglected
(especially in the Higgs mass relations). Thus, in the numerical
analysis, the complete one-loop and the leading two-loop corrections
to the MSSM Higgs masses and the triple Higgs self-couplings are
included. The Higgs masses,
widths and self-couplings have been computed using the  HDECAY program described in Ref.&#160; , which uses a running  -mass
in evaluating the   decay fraction. Thus, for
consistency, we have evolved the value of   entering the  Yukawa couplings of the   decay currents of our processes
in the same way.       For our analysis, we have considered   and  . For the
LHC, high values of   produce a signal cross section much
larger than the   scenario, over almost the entire range
of  . However, this enhancement is due to the increase of the
down-type quark-Higgs coupling, which is proportional to  itself, and serves only to magnify the dominance of the quark box
diagrams of Fig.&#160; . Unfortunately, these graphs have no
dependence on either of the two triple Higgs self-couplings entering
the gluon-gluon process considered here, i.e.,   and . Thus, although the cross section is comfortably
observable, all sensitivity to such vertices is lost. Therefore, the
measurement of the triple Higgs self-coupling,  , is only
feasible at the LHC for low   due to the resonant
production of the heavy Higgs boson (see Fig. 5a of Ref.&#160; ).       In contrast, the cross section for double Higgs production at the LC
is small for large   because there is no heavy Higgs
resonance (see Fig.&#160;8 of Ref.&#160; ).
As soon as it becomes kinematically possible to decay the
heavy Higgs into a light Higgs pair, the   coupling is already too
small to generate a sizable cross section. Furthermore, the continuum
MSSM cross section is suppressed with respect to the SM cross section
since the MSSM couplings   and   vary with   and , respectively, with respect to the corresponding SM
coupling. Notice that in this regime, at a LC, the  vertex could in principle be accessible instead, since  (see Fig.&#160;2 of Ref.&#160; )
and because of the kinematic enhancement induced by  .
Unfortunately, we will see that the size of the   cross
section itself is prohibitively small.       We assume that  -jets are distinguishable from light-quark and gluon
jets and no efficiency to tag the four  -quarks is included in our
parton level results. We further neglect considering the possibility
of the  -jet charge
determination. Also, to simplify the calculations, the   boson
appearing in the final state of the LC process is treated as
on-shell and no branching ratio
(BR) is applied to quantify its possible decays. In
practice, one may assume that it decays leptonically (i.e.,  , with  ) or hadronically into
light-quark jets (i.e.,  , with  ), in order to
avoid problems with  -quark combinatorics. Furthermore, in the LC
analysis, we have not simulated the effects of Initial State Radiation
(ISR), beamstrahlung or Linac energy spread. Indeed, we expect them
to affect signal and backgrounds rather similarly, so we can neglect
them for the time being. Indeed, since a detailed phenomenological
study, including both hadronisation and detector effects, already
exists for the case of double Higgs-strahlung in    ,
whose conclusions basically support those attained in the
theoretical study of Ref.&#160; , we limit ourselves here to
update the latter to the case of the MSSM.       So far only resonant production              has been investigated , with full hadronic and detector simulation and
considering also the (large) QCD backgrounds, and a similar study
does not exist for continuum double Higgs production at the LHC.
(See Ref.&#160;  for a detailed account of the          decay channel.)
The event simulation has been
performed by using a special version of  PYTHIA   , in
which the relevant LO MEs for double Higgs production of
Ref.&#160;  have been implemented by M. El Kacimi and R. Lafaye.
These MEs take into account both continuum and resonant
double Higgs boson production and their interferences.
(The insertion of those for   processes is in progress.) The PYTHIA  interface to  HDECAY  has been exploited in order to
generate the MSSM Higgs mass spectrum and the relevant Higgs BRs, thus
maintaining consistency with the parton level approach. As for the
LHC detector simulation, the fast simulation package
was used, with high luminosity (i.e.,   fb )
parameters.       The motivation for our study is twofold. On the one
hand, to complement the studies of Ref.&#160;  by also
considering the continuum production  at large  . On the other hand, to explore the
possibility of further kinematic suppression
of the various irreducible backgrounds to the resonant channel
at small  .</section><section title="Results">        In our LHC analysis, following the discussion in Sect.&#160; ,
we focus most of our attention on the case  , with  GeV, although other combinations of these two MSSM parameters
will also be considered.
We further set   TeV and take all sparticle masses (and other SUSY
scales) to be as large as   TeV.         Here, we closely follow the selection procedure advocated in
Ref.&#160; . In order to resolve the four  -jets as four
separate systems inside the LC detector region, we impose the
following cuts. First, that the energy of each  -jet is above a
minimum threshold, Second, that any  -jet is isolated from all others, by
requiring a minimum angular separation, Similarly to the hadronic analysis, one can optimise  by imposing the constraints , on exactly two combinations of  -jets. Here, note that the mass
resolution adopted for the quark systems is significantly better
than in the LHC case, due to the cleanliness of the  environment and the expected performance of the LC detectors in jet
momentum and angle reconstruction  . Thus, given such
high mass resolution power from the LC detection apparatus, one may
further discriminate between   and   mass peaks by requiring that
none of the  -jet pairs falls around  , Moreover, in the double Higgs-strahlung process  ,
the four  -quarks are produced centrally,
whereas this is generally not the case for the background (see
the discussion in Ref.&#160; ). This can be exploited by enforcing where   are the polar angles of all
two-, three- and four-jet systems.         Fig.&#160;  shows the production and decay rates of the
signal process,  , as obtained at
the partonic level, after the cuts
( )&#8211;( ) have been implemented. The MSSM
setup here includes some mixing, having adopted   TeV and  TeV, at both   and 50. Notice the onset of the  decay sequence in the Higgs-strahlung
process   at low  . The same does not occur
for large values, as previously explained. The
impact of the above jet selection cuts on the signal is marginal, as
the  -quarks are here naturally isolated and energetic, being the
decay products of heavy objects. In fact, the rates in
Fig.&#160;  would only be 10&#8211;20% higher if all the -quark phase space was allowed (the suppression being larger for
smaller Higgs masses). At the height of the resonant peak around  GeV at  ,
the signal rate is not large but observable,
yielding more than one event every 1 fb  of data. For a high
luminosity 500 GeV TESLA design  , this would correspond to
more than 300 events per year. Given the very high efficiency expected
in tagging  -quark jets, estimated at 90% for each pairs of heavy
quarks  , one should expect a strong sensitivity to the
triple Higgs self-coupling. The situation at large   is
much more difficult instead, being the production rates smaller by
about a factor of 10.         In the left-hand side of Fig.&#160;  we present the EW
background, after the constraints in
( )&#8211;( ) have been enforced, in the form
of the four dominant EW sub-processes. These four channels are the
following.                  The   EW/QCD background is dominated
by   production with one of the two   bosons decaying
hadronically into four  -jets. This subprocess corresponds to the
topology in the middle of the first row of diagrams in Fig.&#160;4 of
Ref.&#160; . Notice that Higgs graphs are involved in this process
as well (bottom-right topology in the mentioned figure of  ).
These correspond to single Higgs-strahlung production with the Higgs
scalar subsequently decaying into   via an off-shell
gluon. Their contribution is not entirely negligible, owing to the
large   production rates, as can be seen in the right-hand side of
Fig.&#160; . The interferences among non-Higgs and Higgs
terms are always negligible.         In performing the signal-to-background analysis, we have chosen two
representative points only, identified by the two following
combinations: (i)   and   GeV (yielding  GeV and   GeV); (ii)   and  GeV (yielding   GeV and   GeV).
These correspond to the two asterisks in Fig.&#160; ,
that is, the maxima of the signal cross sections at both  values. The first corresponds to resonant   production,
whereas the latter to the continuum case. If we enforce the
constraints of eq.&#160;( )&#8211;( ), the
suppression of both EW and EW/QCD is enormous, so that the
corresponding cross sections are of   fb, while the
signal rates only decrease by a factor of four at most. This is the
same situation that was seen for the SM case in Ref.&#160; .
Indeed, in the end it is just a matter of how many signal events
survive, the sum of the backgrounds representing no more than a 10%
correction (see Fig.&#160;11 of Ref.&#160; ). For example, after 500
fb  of data collected,
one is left with 156 and 15 events for case (i) and (ii),
respectively. However, these numbers do not yet include  -tagging
efficiency and   decay rates.</section><section title="Summary">      To summarise, the &#8216;double Higgs production&#8217; subgroup has contributed
to the activity of the Higgs WG by assessing the feasibility of
measurements of triple Higgs self-couplings at future TeV colliders.
The machines considered were the LHC at CERN (14 TeV) and a future LC
running at 500 GeV. In both cases, a high luminosity setup was
assumed, given the smallness of the double Higgs production cross
sections. In particular, the   resonant enhancement was the
main focus of our studies, involving the lightest,  , and the
heaviest,  , of the neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM, in the
kinematic regime  . This dynamics can for example occur
in the following reactions:   in the hadronic case and  in the leptonic one, but only at low  .
These two processes proceed via intermediate stages of the form   and  , respectively, followed by the decay  .
Thus, they in principle allow one to determine the strength of the  vertex involved,  , in turn constraining the form
of the MSSM Higgs potential itself. The signature considered was , as the   decay rate is always
dominant.       We have found that several kinematic cuts can be exploited in order to
enhance the signal-to-background rate to level of high significance,
particularly at the   machine. At the   accelerator, in
fact, the selection of the signal is made much harder by the presence
of an enormous background in   final states due to pure QCD. In
parton level studies, based on the exact calculation of LO scattering
amplitudes of both signals and backgrounds (without any showering and
hadronisation effects but with detector acceptances), we have found
very encouraging results. At a LC, the double Higgs signal can be
studied in an essentially background free environment.
At the LHC, the signal and the QCD background are in the end
at the same level with detectable but not very large cross sections.       Earlier full simulations performed for the   case had already
indicated that a more sophisticated treatment of both signal and
backgrounds, including fragmentation/hadronisation and full detector
effects, should not spoil the results seen at the parton level. For the
LHC, our preliminary studies of  in presence of
the   continuum (and relative interferences)
also point to the feasibility of the signal selection, after realistic
detector simulation and event reconstruction.
As for double   production in the continuum,
although not very useful for Higgs self-coupling measurements,
this seems a promising channel, if not to discover the
lightest MSSM Higgs boson certainly to study its properties
and those of the Higgs sector in general
(because of the large production
and decay rates at high   and its sensitivity to such a parameter),
as shown from novel simulations also presented in this study.
(The discovery potential of this mode will eventually be addressed
in Ref.&#160; .)
Despite lacking a full
background analysis in the LHC case, we have no reason to believe that
a comparable degree of suppression of background events seen at parton level
cannot be achieved also at hadron level. Progress in this respect is
currently being made  .</section></document>
