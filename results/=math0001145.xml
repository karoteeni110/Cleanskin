      We consider commutative algebras and chain algebras over a fixed commutative
ground ring  as in the title.
We are concerned with the problem of computing the cyclic (and Hochschild)
homology of such algebras via free DG-resolutions . We find
spectral sequences:
      
      The algebra  is a divided power version of the de
Rham algebra; in the
particular case when  is a field of characteristic zero, the spectral
sequences above agree with those found in [BuV], where it is shown they
degenerate at the  term. For arbitrary ground rings we prove here
(theorem 2.3) that if  for  then .
From this we derive a formula
for the Hochschild homology of flat complete intersections in terms
of a filtration of the complex for crystalline cohomology, and find a
description of  also in terms of crystalline cohomology (theorem
3.0).
The latter spectral sequence degenerates for complete intersections of
embedding dimension  (Corollary 3.1).
Without flatness assumptions, our results can be viewed as the computation
Shukla (cyclic) homology (as defined in 1.4 below&#8211;see also [PW], [S]).
Particular cases of theorem 3.0
and corollary 3.1 have been obtained in [GG],[L] and [LL]. To our knowledge
this is the first paper to give a unified proof for all of these.
    </para><para>
      The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1
contains the definitions, results and notations used in the paper.
Section 2 is devoted to computing the homology of free algebras. The spectral
sequences 1 are obtained in 2.1-2.2; the degeneracy result is
proved in 2.3.; the fact that the same degeneracy result is not valid for
general free algebras  with
 &#8211;unless &#8211; is proved in 2.4.
In Section 3 we apply the results of
section 2 to complete intersections (Theorem 3.0 and Corollary 3.1).

        We consider algebras over a fixed ground ring  which
is assumed unital and commutative. Algebras are unital
and come equipped with a non-negative gradation  and a differential  with  and ,
and are strictly commutative in the graded sense. Thus not only is

but also  if  is odd. Algebras with this added
structure and strict commutativity condition are called
chain algebras or simply algebras. Usual commutative
algebras are considered as chain algebras concentrated in degree zero.
Two algebra
maps  are homotopic &#8211;and we write &#8211;
if they are homotopic
as chain maps, and are specially homotopic if the
homotopy  is special, i.e. if it verifies . Algebra maps which induce an
isomorphism in homology are called quisms
or quasi-isomorphisms and are denoted . Maps which are
surjective in every degree are denoted . We abuse language
and call a chain algebra free if it is free as a strictly commutative graded algebra. This means
that  is the symmetric algebra
&#8211;in the graded sense&#8211; of some free graded module ; no condition is
imposed on the differential .

      <para>
        By a double mixed complex we shall understand a chain
complex in the category of (single) mixed complexes in the
sense of Kassel. Thus a double mixed complex
is a bigraded module  equipped with three
-linear maps of degree :  which lowers the  index and fixes ;
 which fixes  and lowers , and  which increases
 and fixes . These maps satisfy .
The Hochschild homology of a double mixed complex  as above
is the homology of the double complex , and its
cyclic homology is the homology of the triple complex 
where for each fixed value of ,  is the usual triangular
double complex for cyclic homology ([K]). The homology of a triple complex
is defined by taking the usual  of double complexes twice. One
can do this in different ways which of course yield the same complex
but which suggest different filtrations and thus different spectral sequences. We like to think of 
as the  of the double complex
 with  as vertical boundary and
 as row boundary. Our
choice of spectral sequences is coherent with this. We use the column
filtration of  to obtain the spectral sequence:
        
        Note that  is a double mixed complex. We write 
for the corresponding double
complex as above. Thus  is the first term of the spectral sequence
for the column filtration of the double complex . For the second term in
the spectral sequence  we
have to take homology with respect to , while for  we

        Recall from [B,I.1.1] that a system of divided power operations
for a pair  consisting of a plain algebra
 and an ideal  is a family of maps
 (), with  and satisfying a number
of identities ([B I.1.1.1-1.1.6]) which make them formally analogue to
.
It is shown in [B, I.2.3.1], that the forgetful functor going from
the category of triples  to the category of pairs 
has a left adjoint. We write  for this adjoint functor, which
we call the divided power envelope of . Oftentimes we
shall abuse notation and write  &#8211;or simply &#8211; for .
The ideals  define a descending filtration.
We call  the -filtration. By the crystalline
complex of  we mean the largest quotient  of the de
Rham cochain
algebra of  for which the induced derivation  is a
-derivation, i.e. maps ;
explicitly .
There is a natural isomorphism  of
cochain algebras with -derivation (cf. [I ,Ch.0, 3.1.6]).
Our choice of name for  comes from the fact that,
for example if  is the field with  elements and  is smooth,
essentially of finite type over ,
it computes the crystalline
cohomology

module map, because it is a module map which commutes with the boundary on

        I wrote a first version of this paper in 1993;
I was just learning the subject of differential graded algebras and
thus felt the need to write down every single detail. The result was
a 75 page manuscript. The project of re-writing this paper into a
publishable form has been first on my procrastination list ever since
then. I would never have
done it but for the encouragement and useful suggestions I received from
several people, including L. D&#8217;Alfonso, T. Pirashvili, M. Vigu&#233; and
C. Weibel; thanks to all of them. Thanks also to the people at the
Mathematics deparment of the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bah&#237;a Blanca,
Argentina, for their hospitality. It was during a weeklong visit to that
institution that I first managed to trim down the original manuscript
to an 11 page draft. The referee&#8217;s suggestions for
shortening the proof of Lemma 2.0 helped trim the paper further
to its current size.
