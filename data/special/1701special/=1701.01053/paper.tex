%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

%\section{Extra information when writing JACS Communications}

%When producing communications for \emph{J.~Am.\ Chem.\ Soc.}, the
%class will automatically lay the text out in the style of the
%journal. This gives a guide to the length of text that can be
%accommodated in such a publication. There are some points to bear in
%mind when preparing a JACS Communication in this way.  The layout
%produced here is a \emph{model} for the published result, and the
%outcome should be taken as a \emph{guide} to the final length. The
%spacing and sizing of graphical content is an area where there is
%some flexibility in the process.  You should not worry about the
%space before and after graphics, which is set to give a guide to the
%published size. This is very dependent on the final published layout.

%You should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS
%Communication and a normal article.  For example, this demonstration
%file will work with both \texttt{type=article} and
%\texttt{type=communication}. Sections and any abstract are
%automatically ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The "Acknowledgement" section can be given in all manuscript
%% classes.  This should be given within the "acknowledgement"
%% environment, which will make the correct section or running title.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\include{acknowledgement}

%Please use ``The authors thank \ldots'' rather than ``The
%authors would like to thank \ldots''.

%The author thanks Mats Dahlgren for version one of \textsf{achemso},
%and Donald Arseneau for the code taken from \textsf{cite} to move
%citations after punctuation. Many users have provided feedback on the
%class, which is reflected in all of the different demonstrations
%shown in this document.
%

%% The same is true for Supporting Information, which should use the
%% suppinfo environment.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{suppinfo}
%
%This will usually read something like: ``Experimental procedures and
%characterization data for all new compounds. The class will
%automatically add a sentence pointing to the information on-line:

%% The appropriate \bibliography command should be placed here.

%% and also names the section correctly.
