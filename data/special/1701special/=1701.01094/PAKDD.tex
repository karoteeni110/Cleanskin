\begin{abstract}
Aggregate analysis, such as comparing country-wise sales versus global market share across product categories, is often complicated by the unavailability of common join attributes, e.g., category, across diverse datasets from different geographies
or retail chains, even after disparate data is technically ingested into a common \textit{data lake}.
Sometimes this is a missing data issue, while in other cases it may be inherent, e.g., the records in different 
geographical databases may actually describe different product `SKUs', or follow different norms
for categorization. Record linkage techniques, such as \cite{christen2008febrl} can be used to automatically map products in different data sources
to a common set of \textit{global} attributes, thereby enabling federated aggregation joins to be performed.
Traditional record-linkage techniques are typically unsupervised, relying textual similarity features across attributes
to estimate matches. In this paper, we present an ensemble model combining minimal supervision using Bayesian network
models together with unsupervised textual matching for automating such `attribute fusion'. We present results of our approach 
on a large volume of real-life data from a market-research scenario and compare with a standard record matching algorithm. 
Finally we illustrate how attribute fusion using machine 
learning could be included as a data-lake management feature, especially as our approach also
provides confidence values for matches, enabling human intervention, if required.

\section{Introduction}
\input{Sections/Intro}\label{sec:intro}
\section{Approach}
Each product $l$ in $L$ has two kind of information (1) $M$ Local characteristics and (2) Textual descriptions by retailers. In this section, we present our approach to predict the value of global characteristic $G_j$ for each product in $L$. We use two different models for two different datasets (1) Supervised Bayesian Model (SBM) using local characteristics, and (2) Unsupervised Textual Similarity (UTS) using descriptions to compute probability of every possible state $g_{j,t}, t = 1, 2, ..., m j$ of $G_j$. Finally, we use an weighted ensemble based approach to combine the probabilities of both models to predict the value of $G_j$.
