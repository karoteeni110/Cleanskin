Record linkage of entities across disparate datasets is a widely explored \cite{brizan2015survey}, which has been applied in wide variety of domains like environmental hazards\cite{acheson1979record}, drug safety\cite{noren2005hit}, and to different types of data, including text\cite{li2005semantic} and images~\cite{huang1998object}. While record linkage addresses the problem of extracting, matching and resolving entities in structured and unstructured data\cite{getoor2012entity} across disparate datasets, with or without join keys, our problem address different aspect of record linkage \textit{where disparate databases need to be fused in the absence of natural join key}. 

Record linkage problem has been addressed generally via two category of approaches, learning based and non-learning based~\cite{kopcke2010evaluation}. Learning based approaches include FEBRL\cite{christen2008febrl} which uses support vector machine (SVM) for learning suitable matcher combinations, and MARLIN(Multiply Adaptive Record Linkage with
Induction)\cite{bilenko2003adaptive} which uses two string similarity measures (Edit Distance and Cosine) and several learners, specifically SVM and decision trees. In non-learning based approaches, PPJoin+\cite{xiao2011efficient} is a single-attribute match approach (similarity
join) using sophisticated filtering techniques for improved efficiency, and FellegiSunter\cite{fellegi1969theory} evaluates three of the similarity measures provided by FEBRL (Winkler, Tokenset, Trigram) and has an lower and upper similarity threshold that can be adjusted. In\cite{poon2016ensemble}, an ensemble approach of two non-learning algorithms Fellegi-Sunter (FS) and Jaro-Wrinkler (JW) has been presented for record-linkage. In contrast, we use confidence based ensemble approach that combines learning based Bayesian model and a non-learning based textual model. Our approach also produces confidence bound on the predictions that help to decide reliability of prediction.

Bayesian Networks are used for modeling beliefs in various domains like bioinformatics\cite{friedman2000using}, medicine\cite{uebersax2004genetic}, manufacturing\cite{singh2015predictive}. While traditional approximate inference techniques for Bayesian graphical modeling are able to deal with larger networks, they are usually restricted to models with low cardinalities of attributes. In our approach of BGM, we handle high cardinality attributes by introducing a novel approach of learning restricted Tree based Bayesian network, which facilitates faster (exact) inferencing.  Our work in BGM is closest to\cite{yadav2015business}, which presents an approach to compute distributional queries by approximating the underlying joint distribution via a Bayesian network. In\cite{yadav2015business}, SQL database has been used for Bayesian  inferencing under the assumption of simple networks, which are learned entirely using domain knowledge. In our work of BGM, we present end to end approach of Bayesian graphical modeling which learns simple tree based structure followed by exact Bayesian inferencing accelerated by an SQL engine to predict global characteristics.
