In this section, we present UTS approach to compute the probability $q^{l}_{j,t}$ of each possible state of the global characteristic $G_j$ using retailer descriptions.
Consider each product $l$ in $L$ has $r_l$ descriptions and %$d_{l,1}, d_{l,2}$, $..., d_{l,r_l}$. 
for each description $d_{l,r}$, where $r=1,2,..., r_l$, we find n-grams of adjacent words. Let $N_{l} = \{ n^l_{v}, v=1,2,...\}$ be the set of n-grams of all descriptions, where $f^l_{v}$ be the frequency of each $n^l_{v}$ defined as a ratio of the number of descriptions in which $n^l_{v}$ exists to the $r_l$.

For every state $g_{j,t}$ of $G_j$, we find the best matching n-gram from the set $N_l$ by calculating Jaro-Wrinkler distance between $g_{j,t}$ and every $n^l_v \in N_l$ and choose the n-gram, say $n^l_{v,t}$, with the maximum score $s^l_{j,t}$.  
Further, multiply the scores $s^l_{j,t}$ with the frequency of $n^l_{v,t}$ to get the new score i.e., $S^{l}_{j,t} = s^{l}_{j,t} \times f^s_{l,t}$.
Finally, we convert each score $S^{l}_{j,t}$ into the probability $q^{l}_{j,t}$ by using softmax scaling function.
