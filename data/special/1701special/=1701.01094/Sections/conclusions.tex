We have addressed a particular class of record-linkage problems where disparate databases need to be fused in the absence of matching keys
for the limited purpose of aggregate analysis. Our ensemble approach combines supervised Bayesian models with unsupervised textual similarity, 
and also returns confidence along with each prediction. We submit that our approach is likely to be applicable for similar instances of record-linkage in a wide variety of applications, even while attempting to fuse data from external sources, such as social media, sensor data etc.. Such scenarios are becoming increasingly common as the \textit{data lake} paradigm
is gradually replacing the traditional data-warehouse model, driven by the availability
and accessibility of external `big data' sources.
