  Lifted probabilistic inference (Poole, 2003) and symbolic dynamic programming for lifted 
  stochastic planning (Boutilier et al, 2001) were introduced around the same time as algorithmic efforts to use abstraction in  
  stochastic systems.
  Over the years, 
  %
  these ideas
  evolved into two distinct lines of research, each supported by
  a rich literature.
  %
  %
  %
  Lifted probabilistic inference focused
  on efficient arithmetic operations on template-based graphical
  models under a finite domain assumption while symbolic dynamic
  programming focused on supporting sequential decision-making in rich
  quantified logical action models and on open domain reasoning.  Given their
  common motivation but 
  different focal points, both lines of research have yielded 
  highly complementary innovations.  In this chapter, we aim to help close
  the gap between these two research areas by providing an overview of
  lifted stochastic planning from the perspective of probabilistic inference, 
  showing strong connections to other chapters in this book.
  This also allows us to define {\em generalized lifted inference} as a paradigm 
  that unifies these areas
    %
  %
  and elucidates open problems for future research that can benefit
  both lifted inference and stochastic planning.
