    <p>This paper is concerned with the motion of a single dislocation. Thus there is no dislocation-dislocation interaction; the interaction is between the dislocation and the applied stress. Furthermore we work in two dimensions, which eases the computational burden and aids visualization. Having simplified the problem to this extent, we have a chance of understanding it in detail. Once such understanding is developed, it will then make sense to proceed to more realistic, though computationally more expensive, cases (e.g. three dimensions, realistic potentials, etc.).</p>

    <p>The Lippmann-Schwinger-Low (LSL) integral equations for state vectors
and transition matrices form the backbone of quantum scattering theory [1].
They provide the basis for deriving the Born series in wave mechanics [2],
reaction amplitudes in rearrangement collisions [3], Dyson’s perturbation
expansion
in the Dirac picture [4], and various cross sections in old-fashioned quantum
electrodynamics [5]. The aim of the present paper is to examine some features of the LSL equations which have not been treated adequately in the existing
literature. To be more precise, Lemmas A, B, C and D below answer the following
four questions : (i) Are the LSL representations strictly equivalent to the
underlying Schrodinger eigen equations? (ii) What is a general off/on
energy-shell unitarity-like relation obeyed by the LSL transition amplitudes?
(iii) Do various LSL state vectors accurately satisfy the orthonormality
relations mentioned by Goldberger-Watson [6]? (iv) Can we confirm the
results explicitly in the case of a separable potential for
which the LSL solutions can be obtained in closed form [7]?<throwit /></p>

    <p>Electrorheological (ER) fluids are suspensions of dielectric particles (usually

particles with radii below several </throwit><throwit>m Brownian motion is still important and
such dispersions are called colloidal. When electric fields are applied across

low shear stresses the suspensions behave like solids, and at stresses greater
than a ‘yield stress’ the suspensions flow with enhanced viscosity. The
rheological response is observed to occur in milliseconds, and is reversible.
This combination of electrical and rheological properties has led to many

    <p>The signatures for SUSY at the LHC depend very much on the SUSY masses,
which presumably result from spontaneous SUSY breaking. It is not
possible to break SUSY spontaneously using just the MSSM fields; instead
one must do so in a hidden sector and then communicate the breaking
through some interaction. In supergravity models, the communication is
through gravity. In gauge mediated models it is through gauge
interactions; the gravitino is then very light and can play an important
role. Simple examples of both have been discussed previously. A third
possibility is that the hidden sector does not have the right structure
to provide masses through either mechanism; then the leading
contributions come from a combination of gravity and anomalies. This is
known as Anomaly Mediated SUSY Breaking (AMSB), and it predicts a different
pattern of masses and signatures.</p>

    <p>The paper is
built up from two parts: the first one presents
algebraic tools which are used in the second part
to extend some geometric concepts to the infinite
dimensional context. The approach to the geometry
of loop groups we present in the second part uses
weighted traces and it is new to our knowledge.
Weighted traces offer a useful tool to prove
both algebraic and geometric results, some of
which had been proved elsewhere by other
methods.  Let us describe the contents of
the first part of the paper (sections 1-4).
The Lie algebra of interest in our
context is the infinite dimensional
Lie algebra of
pseudo-differential operators (P.D.Os) acting on sections of some
finite rank vector bundle <throwit> based on a closed manifold </throwit><throwit> (its dimension
does not yet play a role at this stage).
The Lie bracket is given by the operator bracket.
It is well known that when the manifold is connected and of dimension
strictly larger than </throwit><throwit>, the only trace on this algebra, i.e the only
</throwit><throwit> valued linear functional which
satisfies the </throwit><text font="italic">tracial property </text> namely <throwit>,
is the Wodzicki residue trace [W], see also [K] for a review.
 Here we shall consider linear functionals on this algebra which arise
as </throwit><text font="italic">zeta function regularized traces </text>. They involve a
<text font="italic">weight</text> given by a positive
self-adjoint elliptic operator and in general
depend on the choice of the weight hence the terminology
<text font="italic">weighted traces </text> which we shall use here.
One can find such ”traces” (sometimes implicitely) in the
literature on determinant bundles [BF] (in particular in the connection and the
curvature) and more generally when investigating geometry in infinite dimensions (in particular
for the notion of minimality of submanifolds [MRT],[AP]). Here we will be using them
to define the Ricci curvature on current groups and first Chern form on loop groups.  These weighted traces
extend the so called canonical trace
of Kontsevich and Vishik [KV1] defined on the subalgebra
of P.D.Os with integer order that lie in the odd class (defined below) provided
the dimension
of the underlying manifold is odd.
On this subalgebra (which contains ordinary differential operators)
the weighted traces
actually obey the tracial property
<throwit> which is not the case on the whole algebra of P.D.Os.
 Here,
rather than searching for subalgebras on which
the ”weighted traces” actually are traces, we focus
on the obstruction that prevents them from being traces
on a bigger subalgebra of P.D.Os.
It is measured by the coboundary of the weighted trace and yields
a generalization of the well known Radul cocycle (see [KK], [R],
[M2]). It is
of infinite dimensional essence since it can be
expressed in terms of a Wodzicki
residue which is a purely infinite dimensional trace.
 With this idea in mind of studying
infinite dimensional obstructions rather than restricting
ourselves to subalgebras on which they vanish,
using weighted traces
we build up bilinear functionals on </throwit><text font="italic">the
whole</text> algebra of classical P.D.Os. These
restrict to the twisted Radul [M2] and Schwinger
[S], [M2], [CFNW] cocycles on the (rather small)
subalgebra of P.D.Os that lie in <throwit>, the
algebra of bounded operators
</throwit><throwit> such that
</throwit><throwit> is
of order no larger than
</throwit><throwit> where </throwit><throwit> is the ”sign” of
some self-adjoint elliptic operator.  Finally,
we investigate the link between our Schwinger
functional and a generalization of another cocycle
arising in the context of a central extension of
the group
</throwit><throwit> of invertible operators in </throwit><throwit>.
These relations boil down to well-known [PS]
identifications of these cocycles on the
restriction to </throwit><throwit> for
the obstruction to such identifications which is given in terms of Radul
cocycles vanishing on this subalgebra.
 Let us now turn to a more geometric
point of view which leads us to the second part
of the paper (sections 5-9). We now consider families of pseudo-differential operators, extending
the notion of weighted trace to such families. On top of the algebraic obstructions mentioned
above, due to the dependence on the weight, there are obstructions of
geometric type which arise when trying to generalize properties
of
classical geometric concepts to infinite dimensions.
 Current groups </throwit><throwit> where </throwit><throwit>
is a manifold and </throwit><throwit> is a Lie group,
offer a first tractable example of infinite dimensional manifold. As spaces of classical paths
in Wess-Zumino Witten models, they play an important role in quantum field theories.
They have been the topic of many an investigation
and particularly from a geometric point of
view (e.g. [DL], [F1,2], [P], [PS], [SP], [Wu]).
In a pioneering article [F1], Freed suggested a
way to geeneralize to these groups some of the
methods available to study finite dimensional Lie
groups. In particular, he defined a Ricci
curvature on current groups and a first Chern
form on the
</throwit><throwit> based loop group which is
Kähler. Other methods [SW] have since then been
suggested, leading to the same expressions. In
[F1] (see also [F2], [SW]) the author uses a
”conditioned” trace which involves taking a ”two
step trace”, namely first the trace on the Lie
algebra of the finite dimensional Lie group </throwit><throwit>
and then, when the operator obtained this way
is trace-class, taking its trace. He shows that
the (conditioned)
first Chern form on the based loop group is proportional to the symplectic form, from which follows on one hand that
it is closed and hence defines the first Chern class, and on the other hand that it
is Kähler-Einstein.
 Here we suggest a more general approach to
defining Ricci curvature and first Chern forms on
a class
of manifolds which includes the current groups mentioned above. Carried out (in a left invariant
way ) to current Lie groups equipped with a weight
given by a left invariant field of elliptic
operators, the notion of weighted trace
enables us to define the </throwit><text font="italic">weighted Ricci
curvature</text> as a weighted pseudo-trace of <throwit>
where </throwit><throwit>
is the curvature tensor and the </throwit><text font="italic">weighted first Chern form</text>
as a weighted pseudo-trace of the curvature,
provided the operators involved are classical
P.D.Os.
 We express the weighted first Chern form in
terms of a pull-back by the adjoint
representation of a cocycle on <throwit>, thus
relating the closed two form given by the Chern
form with a closed two cochain.
 A well known result by Kuiper [Ku] shows that
a Hilbert manifold is parallelisable since
</throwit><throwit> is contractible for a Hilbert space </throwit><throwit>
(the model space of the manifold). This might seem
in conflict with the fact that the first Chern
class does not vanish. But in our approach, the
model space </throwit><throwit> being a space of sections of some
(finite rank) vector bundle
</throwit><throwit> based on a closed manifold </throwit><throwit>, the structure group
</throwit><throwit> reduces to a non contractible group, namely the
group
</throwit><throwit> of zero order invertible elliptic
operators acting on these sections.  This opens a road to many questions, such as
finding a criteria for the weighted first
Chern form and higher order forms to be
closed, investigating the holonomy group
which we expect to be non trivial because of the
reasons mentioned above. This article
yields a geometric setting in which such
questions make sense for a class of Hilbert
manifolds beyong the example of loop groups.
It confronts this approach with other
approaches in the specific case of loop
groups.</throwit></p>

    <p>Supersymmetry is an exciting idea to relate bosons and fermions. Many particle
physicists think that supersymmetry could be found in Nature, not too far from the
electroweak scale, typically the TeV scale. From a theoretical point of view,
supersymmetry naturally explains, for example, the large ratio between the electroweak
scale and the other higher physical scales as the Planck or the GUT scales.
Moreover, supersymmetry favours the unification for the three fundamental coupling
constants responsible for the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong interactions.
With the present data, such an unification is not possible within the Standard
Model but becomes probable in its supersymmetric version like the MSSM (Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model). Supersymmetry can also enrich quantum mechanics
and gives the so called supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM) which is a nice
framework to test new concepts in Physics. SQM is famous due to the pioneering papers
of Witten on supersymmetry breaking[1]. SQM also gives new understandings of the analytical
solvability of certain potentials and of the (super)BKW approximation which
turns out to be exact for a large class of potentials, or allows connections between
isospectral hamiltonians and the multi-soliton solution of the Korteweg-De Vries
non linear equation. Much more about SQM can be found in [2,3] and references therein.</p>

    <p>The minimal supersymmetric standard

extensions contain many free parameters associated with
supersymmetry breaking. Most analyses have been based on two
generic classes of models of soft supersymmetry breaking: (1)
supergravity, in which supersymmetry breaking in a hidden sector is
transmitted to the observable sector via supergravity. One usually
assumes universality or at least a comparable scale for the soft
parameters at the Planck scale. (2) Gauge-mediated models, with the
breaking transmitted via messenger fields at relatively low energy,
such as <throwit> GeV. In both cases the scale of the soft
supersymmetry breaking parameters ultimately sets the electroweak
