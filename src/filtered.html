<h1 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>The existing contemporary communications systems can be abstractly characterized by the conceptual seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection model. The lowest (or first) layer, known as the PHYSICAL LAYER, aims to describe the communication process over an actual physical medium. Due to the increasing demand for flexibility, information exchange nowadays often occurs via antennas at the transmitting and receiving end of a wireless medium, E.G., using mobile phones or tablets for data transmission and reception. An electromagnetic signal transmitted over a wireless channel is however prone to interference, fading, and environmental effects caused by, E.G., surrounding buildings, trees, and vehicles, making reliable wireless communications a challenging technological problem.</p>
<p>With the advances in communications engineering, it was soon noticed that increasing the number of spatially separated transmit and receive antennas, as well as adding redundancy by repeatedly transmitting the same information encoded over multiple time instances<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, can dramatically improve the transmission quality. A code representing both diversity over time and space is thus called a SPACE–TIME CODE. Let us consider a channel with  and  antennas at its transmitting and receiving end, respectively, and assume that transmission occurs over  consecutive time instances. If , the channel is called SYMMETRIC, and otherwise asymmetric, which more precisely typically refers to the case . For the time being, a space–time code  will just be a finite collection of complex matrices in . The channel equation in this multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setting is given by  where  is the received matrix, and  is the SPACE–TIME CODE matrix. In the above equation, we adopt the Rayleigh fading channel model, I.E., the entries of the random CHANNEL MATRIX  are complex variables with identically distributed real and imaginary parts,  yielding a Rayleigh distributed envelope  with scale parameter . We assume further that the channel remains static during the entire transmission of the codeword matrix , and then changes independently of its previous state. The additive noise<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is modeled by the NOISE MATRIX , whose entries are independent, identically distributed complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean.</p>
<p>Let us briefly discuss what constitutes a “good” code. Consider a space–time code , and let  be code matrices ranging over . Two basic design criteria can be derived in order to minimize the probability of error <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>The DIVERSITY GAIN of a code is the asymptotic slope of the error probability curve with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio () in a  scale, and relates to the minimum rank  over all pairs of distinct code matrices . The minimum rank of  should satisfy  in which case  is called a FULL-DIVERSITY code.</p>
<p>The CODING GAIN measures the difference in  required for two different codes to achieve the same error probability. For a full-diversity code this is proportional to the determinant </p>
<p>We define the MINIMUM DETERMINANT of a code  as the infimum  as the code size increases, . If , the space–time code is said to have the NONVANISHING DETERMINANT property <span class="citation"></span>. In other words, a nonvanishing determinant guarantees that the minimum determinant is bounded from below by a positive constant even in the limit, and hence the error probability will not blow up when increasing the code size.</p>
<p>In 2003, the usefulness of central simple algebras to construct space–time codes meeting both of the above criteria was established in <span class="citation"></span>; especially of (cyclic) division algebras, for which the property of being division immediately implies full diversity. Thereupon the construction of space–time codes started to rely on cleverly designed algebraic structures, leading to the construction of multiple extraordinary codes, such as the celebrated Golden code <span class="citation"></span>, or general Perfect codes <span class="citation"></span>. It was later shown in <span class="citation"></span> that in a cyclic division algebra based code, achieving the nonvanishing determinant property can be ensured by restricting the entries of the codewords to certain subrings of the algebra alongside with a smart choice for the base field, and that ensuring nonvanishing determinants is enough to achieve the optimal trade-off between diversity and multiplexing.</p>
<p>Further investigation carried out in <span class="citation"></span> showed that codes constructed from orders, in particular MAXIMAL ORDERS, of cyclic division algebras performed exceptionally well. The main observation is that the discriminant of the order is directly related to the offered coding gain, and should be as small as possible in order to maximize the coding gain.</p>
<p>Maximal orders were then the obvious candidates, as they maximize the normalised density of the corresponding lattice and hence also maximize the coding gain. Unfortunately, they are in general very difficult to compute and may result in highly skewed lattices making the bit labeling a delicate problem on its own. Therefore, NATURAL ORDERS with a simpler structure have become a more frequent choice as they provide a good compromise between the two common extremes: using maximal orders to optimize coding gain, on the one hand, and restricting to orthogonal lattices to simplify bit labeling, encoding, and decoding, on the other.</p>
<p>However, the current explicit constructions are typically limited to the symmetric case, while the asymmetric case remains largely open. The main goal of this article is to fill this gap, though our interest is not to analyze the performance of explicit codes. Instead, we focus on the algebraic setup and provide lower bounds for the smallest possible discriminants of natural orders for the considered setups, and give explicit field extensions and corresponding cyclic division algebras meeting the lower bounds.</p>
<p>This article is structured as follows. In Section [sec:stc] we will shortly introduce MIMO space–time coding and the construction of space–time codes using representations of orders in central simple algebras. Section [sec:nat_orders] contains the main results of this article. We will consider the most interesting asymmetric MIMO channel setups and fix  or  as the base field to guarantee the nonvanishing determinant property<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For each considered setup , we will find an explicit field extension  and an explicit -central cyclic division algebra over , such that the norm of the discriminant of its natural order is minimal. This will translate into the largest possible determinant (see and <span class="citation"></span> for the proof) and thus provide us with the maximal coding gain one can achieve by using a natural order.</p>
<h1 id="sec:stc">Space–time codes from orders in central simple algebras</h1>
<p>From now on, and for the sake of simplicity, we set the number  of transmit antennas equal to the number  of time slots used for transmission and shortly denote . Thus, the considered codewords will be square matrices.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sec2">Space–time lattice codes</h2>
<p>Very simplistically defined, a space–time code is a finite set of complex matrices. However, in order to avoid accumulation points at the receiver, in practical implementations it is convenient to impose an additional discrete structure on the code, such as a lattice structure. We define a SPACE–TIME CODE to be a finite subset of a LATTICE  where  is a LATTICE BASIS. We recall that a lattice in  is FULL if . We call a space–time lattice code SYMMETRIC, if its underlying lattice is full, and ASYMMETRIC<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> otherwise.</p>
<p>Due to linearity, given a lattice  and ,  This implies that any lattice  satisfying the nonvanishing determinant property can be scaled so that  achieves any wanted nonzero value. Consequently, a meaningful comparison of different lattices requires some kind of normalization. To this end, consider the Gram matrix of ,  where  denotes the matrix trace. The volume  of  is related to the Gram matrix as .</p>
<p>The NORMALIZED MINIMUM DETERMINANT <span class="citation"></span> of  is the minimum determinant of  after scaling it to have a unit size fundamental parallelotope, that is, </p>
<p>The NORMALIZED DENSITY <span class="citation"></span> of  is </p>
<p>We get the immediate relation , from which it follows that in order to maximize the coding gain it suffices to maximize the density of the lattice. Maximizing the density, for its part, translates into a certain DISCRIMINANT MINIMIZATION PROBLEM <span class="citation"></span>, as we shall see in Section [subsec:stc_orders] (cf. ). This observation is crucial and will be the main motivation underlying Section [sec:nat_orders].</p>
<h2 id="central-simple-algebras-and-orders">Central simple algebras and orders</h2>
<p>We recall that a finite dimensional algebra over a number field  is an -CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRA, if its center is precisely  and it has no nontrivial ideals. An algebra is said to be DIVISION if all of its nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse. By <span class="citation"></span>, as long as the underlying algebraic structure of a space–time code is a division algebra, the full-diversity property of the code will be guaranteed. It turns out that if  is an algebraic number field, then every -central simple algebra is a CYCLIC ALGEBRA <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>Let  be a cyclic extension of number fields of degree  with respective rings of integers  and , and cyclic Galois group . We fix a nonzero element  and consider the right -vector space  with left multiplication defined by  for all , and . The triple  is referred to as a CYCLIC ALGEBRA of INDEX .</p>
<p>The obvious choice of lattices in  will be its ORDERS. We recall that if  is a Dedekind ring, an -order in  is a subring  which shares the same identity as , is a finitely generated -module, and generates  as a linear space over . Furthermore, an order is MAXIMAL if it not properly contained in any other -order of . Of special interest in this article is the -module  which we refer to as the NATURAL ORDER of .</p>
<p>Throughout the paper, we will denote the relative field norm map of the extension  by  and the absolute norm map by . The restriction of this map to orders may be specified in the notation as  and .</p>
<p>If the element  fails to be an algebraic integer, then  will not be closed under multiplication. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition for an index- cyclic algebra  to be division is that  for all primes . This is a simple extension of a well-known result due to A. Albert, for more details and a proof see <span class="citation"></span>. In what follows we will refer to such a non-zero element  as a NON-NORM ELEMENT for .</p>
<p>We recall that given a Dedekind ring  and an -order  with basis  over , the -discriminant of  is the ideal  where  denotes the reduced trace, which will be defined in .</p>
<p>While the ring of algebraic integers is the unique maximal order in an algebraic number field, an -central simple division algebra may contain several maximal orders. They all share the same discriminant <span class="citation"></span>, known as the discriminant  of the algebra . Given two -orders , , it is clear that if , then ). Consequently,  for every -order  in , and the ideal norm  is the smallest possible among all -orders of .</p>
<h2 id="subsec:stc_orders">Algebraic space–time codes from representations of orders</h2>
<p>Let  be a cyclic division algebra of index . We fix compatible embeddings of  and  into , and identify  and  with their images under these embeddings. The -linear transformation of  given by left multiplication by an element  results in an -algebra homomorphism  to which we refer to as the MAXIMAL REPRESENTATION. An element  can be identified via  with the matrix  The determinant  and trace  define the REDUCED NORM and REDUCED TRACE of , respectively. We may shortly denote  and , when there is no danger of confusion.</p>
<p>Next, given an order  in , we may use the maximal representation to define an injective map . If the center  of the algebra is quadratic imaginary and  admits an  basis, then  is a lattice, and any finite subset  of  will be a space–time lattice code, in the literature often referred to as ALGEBRAIC SPACE–TIME CODE.</p>
<p>Due to the algebra being division, the above matrices will be invertible, and hence any algebraic space–time code constructed in this way will have full diversity. Moreover, if , we have  <span class="citation"></span>, guaranteeing nonvanishing determinants for  or quadratic imaginary.</p>
<p>We now relate the minimum determinant of a code to the density of the underlying lattice , which is the main motivation for choosing orders with small discriminant. If the center  of the cyclic algebra is quadratic imaginary and the considered order  admits an -basis, the volume  of the lattice relates to the discriminant of the order as <span class="citation"></span>  where  is a constant which depends on the center and . Thus, for fixed minimum determinant, the density of the code (cf. ) – and consequently the coding gain – is maximized by minimizing the discriminant of the order.</p>
<p>[exp:golden] Let  be a quadratic real extension of number fields with Galois group . Let  be of class number 1 and ,  the respective rings of integers. We choose  such that , and define the cyclic division algebra  where . We consider the natural order  of  and construct an algebraic space–time code as a finite subset </p>
<p>The choice of fields  and element  gives rise to the Golden algebra and to the well-known GOLDEN CODE <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>The above example relates to the symmetric scenario, I.E., it has an underlying lattice that is full. Full lattices can be efficiently decoded when , and the same lattice codes can also be employed when . There is no simple optimal decoding method for symmetric codes, however, when <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Building upon symmetric codes, we now briefly introduce BLOCK DIAGONAL ASYMMETRIC space–time codes <span class="citation"></span>, better suited for the asymmetric scenario. Let  be a tower of field extensions with extension degrees , , and , and with Galois groups  and . We fix a non-norm element , and consider the cyclic division algebra  Given any order  in , we identify each element  with its maximal representation  and construct the following infinite block-diagonal lattice achieving the nonvanishing determinant property, provided that the base field  is either  or quadratic imaginary <span class="citation"></span>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CODE RATE <span class="citation"></span> of a space–time code carved out from  in (complex) symbols per channel use is  We point out that  is the maximum code rate that allows for avoiding accumulation points at the receiving end with  receive antennas.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to construct an algebraic space–time code, we first choose a central simple algebra over a suitable base field and then look for a dense lattice in it. This amounts to selecting an adequate order in the algebra. As motivated earlier, we will opt for natural orders as a compromise between simplicity and maximal coding gain.</p>
<h1 id="sec:nat_orders">Natural orders with minimal discriminant</h1>
<p>As an illustration of the general algebraic setup, consider the tower of extensions depicted in Figure [fig:tower].</p>
<p>In order to get the nonvanishing determinant property, we fix the base field , as well as the extension degrees  and . With these parameters fixed, our goal is to find an explicit field extension  with  and a non-norm element  such that  is a cyclic extension,  is a cyclic division algebra, and the absolute value  is the minimum possible among all cyclic division algebras satisfying the fixed conditions. Our constructions rely on some key properties of cyclic division algebras and their orders that we will next present as lemmata.</p>
<p><span><span class="citation"></span> and <span class="citation"></span></span> [pro:disc] Let  be a cyclic division algebra of index  and  a non-norm element. We have  with  the -discriminant of . Hence, if , then by the discriminant tower formula </p>

<p>It is often preferred that  for balanced transmission power. However, there are good ‘remedy’ techniques for the case when , see E.G., <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="general-strategy">General Strategy</h2>
<p>We briefly elaborate on the three-step strategy that we will follow to prove each of the theorems. Let ,  and  be fixed.</p>
<h4 id="section"></h4>
<p>We start by finding an explicit cyclic extension  of degree , , such that  and  is cyclic with  smallest possible. In the cases where , our extension  will either be quadratic or quartic cyclic, and we simply use well-known formulas for computing . For  we resort to the following results from Class Field Theory (all the details can be found in <span class="citation"></span>).</p>
<p>Let  be an abelian extension of number fields. For each prime  of  that is unramified in  there is a unique element  that induces the Frobenius automorphism  on the residue field extensions  for the primes  in  extending . The order of  in  equals the residue class degree , and the subgroup  of  is the decomposition group of . The ARTIN MAP for  is the homomorphism  on the group  of fractional - ideals generated by the prime ideals  of  that do not divide the discriminant . These are unramified in . For an ideal  in  we call  the ARTIN SYMBOL of  in .</p>
<p>The ARTIN RECIPROCITY LAW states that if  is an abelian extension, then there exists a nonzero ideal  such that the kernel of the Artin map  contains all principal -ideals  with  totally positive and . We define a MODULUS of  to be a formal product , where  is a nonzero -ideal and  is a subset of the real primes of . We write  if  at the primes  dividing the finite part  and  is positive at the real primes in the infinite part . In the language of moduli, Artin’s Reciprocity Law asserts that there exists a modulus  such that the kernel of the Artin map contains the RAY GROUP  of principal -ideals  generated by elements . The set of these ADMISSIBLE moduli for  consists of the multiples of some minimal modulus , the CONDUCTOR of . The primes occurring in  are the primes of , both finite and infinite, that ramify in . If  is an admissible modulus for , and  denotes the group of fractional -ideals generated by the primes  coprime to , then the Artin map induces a surjective homomorphism  where  is the RAY CLASS GROUP, and  with </p>
<p>The EXISTENCE THEOREM from Class Field Theory states that for every modulus  of , there exists an extension  for which the map in is an isomorphism. Inside some fixed algebraic closure of , the RAY CLASS FIELD  is uniquely determined as the maximal abelian extension of  in which all the primes in the ray group  split completely. Conversely, if  is abelian then  whenever  is an admissible modulus for . For , we have  in and an ARTIN ISOMORPHISM </p>
<p>For all , the ray group  is contained in the subgroup  of principal ideals in , with , the class group of . There is a natural exact sequence  and the residue class in  of  coprime to  in the finite group  consists of its ordinary residue class modulo  and the signs of its images under the real primes .</p>
<p>Finally, we compute the discriminant  using Hasse’s conductor-discriminant formula  where  ranges over the characters of the finite group  and  denotes the finite part of the conductor  of the ideal group  modulo  satisfying .</p>
<h4 id="section-1"></h4>
<p>Unfortunately, having  smallest possible is not sufficient for  to be smallest possible as well. Using and we can derive a positive lower bound on the size of a non-norm element  as  where  is a pair of norm-wise smallest prime ideals in . If  is minimal and , as will be the case in Theorems [thm:res1] and [thm:res2] below, we need to balance the size of  and  in order to achieve minimality of .</p>
<p>In the last three theorems, we will then proceed as follows. Given two cyclic algebras  and  of index , where ,  and such that , we have by , since norms in  are positive,  with </p>
<p>Our strategy will be to fix a non-norm element  of smallest possible norm, compute  and, along the lines of Step 1, compare  with , where  runs over all degree- cyclic field extensions such that  and  is a non-norm element for  of smallest possible norm.</p>
<h4 id="section-2"></h4>
<p>If  is smallest possible and , as will be the case in Theorems [thm:res3], [thm:res4] and [thm:res5], the optimal situation would be to be able to choose a non-norm element  which is a unit, . Hasse’s Norm Theorem will help us decide whether such an element exists and, if it does, how to find it. We use the following strategy from the theory of local fields to compute  when  is an extension of non-Archimedean local fields (all the details can be found in <span class="citation"></span>).</p>
<p>Let  be a field, complete under a discrete valuation . Let  be its valuation ring with maximal ideal , generated by a local uniformizing parameter  with , and  the residue field, where  is a power of a rational prime . Denote by  the multiplicative group of invertible elements  of , and set , . Then, , where  is a complete set of representatives of , and  As  is cyclic of order , we may take , where  denotes a primitive -th root of unity in .</p>
<p>Let  be finite separable extension of ,  the integral closure of  in , and let , , , ,  and  be defined as above. As usual, we denote the ramification index and residue degree of  in  by  and , respectively. We have  and  with  a unit, so that .</p>
<p>The group  is a subgroup of  with , and  with  a power of . Consequently, if the extension is unramified, i.e. , then  and every unit is a norm.</p>
<p>Suppose hereinafter that  is a totally tamely ramified extension, thus , , ,  and the LOCAL CONDUCTOR, I.E., the smallest integer  such that , is 1 (<span class="citation"></span>). Then  and . Consequently,  Since  is not a unit, we conclude that in the totally tamely ramified case, </p>
<p>With the above information at hand, we go back to the extension  found in Step 1 with . In order to produce a suitable unit  which is not a local norm at some prime ramifying in the extension, we compute the ramified primes as well as  in the corresponding local extension . Considering  as a subset of  and using Hensel’s lemma, we look for a unit in  such that its image in  lies outside . Unfortunately, if , as will be the case in Theorems [thm:res3] and [thm:res5], a non-norm unit for  will not exist. In those cases the sizes of  and  in must be balanced using in order to achieve minimality of .</p>
<h2 id="main-results">Main Results</h2>
<p>We are now ready to state and prove the main results of this article.</p>
<p>[thm:res1] Let ,  square-free, and . Any cyclic division algebra  of index 2 satisfies , and equality is achieved for , .</p>

<p>:</p>
<p> We start by finding the smallest possible discriminant over  for cyclic extensions of degree 4. Let  any be any such extension. By the existence theorem of Class Field Theory, we know that  is contained in the ray class field , where  is an admissible modulus for the extension . The smallest ray class field will have conductor , which, since  is a complex field, will be an ideal of . The restriction of the Artin map to  gives us a canonical isomorphism  (cf. ), which implies . Furthermore, since the class group  is trivial and , by we have the exact sequence  Thus, . The ray class field of conductor 2 is trivial, which is not our case, so  does not divide 2. The map  is injective, so that . Consequently, </p>
<p>Fortunately we can find ideals of norm 17 with the required properties. We fix  (or ), so that the ray class field of conductor  is precisely . Since  is a prime ideal, all non-trivial characters of  have conductor , so that by the conductor-discriminant formula , . The absolute discriminant is . We choose  and , and prove that this choice yields the smallest possible discriminant of a cyclic extension of degree 4 over . To that end, let  be any ideal of  of norm different from 17 for which , and let  be a subfield with  cyclic of degree 4. Assume that . Since  has conductor , by the minimality of  the quartic characters of  have conductor . The quadratic character could have smaller conductor, but it cannot be smaller than 3, since  admits no ray class field of conductor  with . Using the conductor-discriminant formula and as norms in  are positive, we have  and so  Since , we have . But then necessarily , a contradiction to our assumption.</p>
<p> Let , with  a root of . A pair of norm-wise smallest primes in  is , of respective norms 2 and 5. Consequently,  (cf. ), so that  will achieve the smallest possible value among all central division algebras satisfying the given conditions for a unit non-norm element . Unfortunately, as we will show next, there is no suitable unit in this case, forcing us to consider other non-norm elements.</p>
<p> By the Hasse Norm Theorem, to show that an element in  is not a norm, it suffices to show that it is not a local norm at some prime of . We need to produce a unit  with , and since in an unramified local extension all units are norms, we consider the local extension corresponding to the ramifying prime . It is not difficult to verify that ,  and .</p>
<p>Let  and  be the completions of  and  with respect to the discrete valuations associated to the primes  of  and  of . Then  is a totally and tamely ramified cyclic local extension of degree 2, with . Using ,  and, by Hensel’s lemma, an element in  will be a non-norm element for  if and only if its image in  is not a square in .</p>
<p>Since  and the norm of every unit in  is , we have . Consequently, the norm of the image in  of every element in  is a square. Over finite fields, this is the case if and only it such an image is itself a square, which for its part implies that every element in  maps to  and, hence, is in the image of the map . We conclude that there exists no unit which is a non-norm element for , forcing us to use to balance the sizes of  and  in in order to achieve minimality of .</p>
<p>Since the norm of an element  is the product of the norms of the prime ideals dividing , it is easy to verify that the smallest possible norm in  is 4. We set  with , which yields . In order to study the possible values of , let  be any ideal of  of norm different from 17, for which , and let  be a subfield of the ray class field , with  cyclic of degree 4.</p>
<p>The smallest possible norms for  are given by </p>
<p>Using , we see that , so that we only need to consider the cases for which , I.E., only the case .</p>
<p>We compute . The smallest quadratic discriminant for an extension in which both  and a prime of norm  ramify is , corresponding to the extension . Thus, , with  and . Consequently, for all , . By , we are done.</p>
<p>[thm:res4] Let  with  and . Any cyclic division algebra  satisfies . The lower bound is achieved for ,  and , where  is a primitive  root of unity and  a root of .</p>
<p>:</p>
<p> We start by finding the smallest possible discriminant over  for cyclic extensions of degree 6. We denote by ,  and  cyclic extensions of degree 2 and 3 over  and their compositum, respectively. Using , and arguments similar to those used in Theorem [thm:res3], we deduce that the smallest possible cubic discriminant is , corresponding to the extension  <span class="citation"></span>, where  is a root of the polynomial .</p>
<p>Since we want to minimize , the use of , requires that we consider separately the cases where  is and is not relatively prime to , and check which case yields a smaller value for this discriminant.</p>

Consequently,  for all choices of . Now,  We conclude that  for all possible choices of  and , and the theorem follows.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>In this article we have introduced the reader to a technique used in multiple-input multiple-output wireless communications known as space–time coding. Within this framework, we have recalled several design criteria which have been derived in order to ensure a good performance of codes constructed from representations of orders in central simple algebras. In particular, we have explained why it is crucial to choose orders with small discriminants as the underlying algebraic structure in order to maximize the coding gain. While maximal orders achieve the minimal discriminant and hence the maximal coding gain among algebraic space–time codes, we have motivated why in practice it may sometimes be favorable to use the so-called natural orders instead. However, one should bare in mind that orthogonal lattices have yet additional benefits such as simple bit labeling and somewhat simpler encoding and decoding, so there is a natural tradeoff between simplicity and coding gain.</p>
<p>For the base fields  or  imaginary quadratic (corresponding to the most typical signaling alphabets), and pairs of extension degrees  in an asymmetric channel setup, we have computed an explicit number field extension  and a non-norm element  giving rise to a cyclic division algebra whose natural order  achieves the minimum discriminant among all cyclic division algebras with the same degree and base field assumptions. This way we have produced explicit space–time codes attaining the optimal coding gain among codes arising from natural orders.</p>
