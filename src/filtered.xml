    <title>Natural orders for asymmetric space–time coding: minimizing the
discriminant</title>
    <abstract>Algebraic space–time coding — a powerful technique developed in the
context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications
— has profited tremendously from tools from Class Field Theory and, more
concretely, the theory of central simple algebras and their orders.
During the last decade, the study of space–time codes for practical
applications, and more recently for future generation (5G+) wireless
systems, has provided a practical motivation for the consideration of
many interesting mathematical problems. One such problem is the explicit
computation of orders of central simple algebras with small
discriminants. In this article, we consider the most interesting
asymmetric MIMO channel setups and, for each treated case, we provide
explicit pairs of fields and a corresponding non-norm element giving
rise to a cyclic division algebra whose natural order has the minimum
possible discriminant.<abstract>

<outline text="Introduction" _note="The existing contemporary communications systems can be abstractly&#10;characterized by the conceptual seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection&#10;model. The lowest (or first) layer, known as the PHYSICAL LAYER, aims to&#10;describe the communication process over an actual physical medium. Due&#10;to the increasing demand for flexibility, information exchange nowadays&#10;often occurs via antennas at the transmitting and receiving end of a&#10;wireless medium, E.G., using mobile phones or tablets for data&#10;transmission and reception. An electromagnetic signal transmitted over a&#10;wireless channel is however prone to interference, fading, and&#10;environmental effects caused by, E.G., surrounding buildings, trees, and&#10;vehicles, making reliable wireless communications a challenging&#10;technological problem.&#10;&#10;With the advances in communications engineering, it was soon noticed&#10;that increasing the number of spatially separated transmit and receive&#10;antennas, as well as adding redundancy by repeatedly transmitting the&#10;same information encoded over multiple time instances[^1], can&#10;dramatically improve the transmission quality. A code representing both&#10;diversity over time and space is thus called a SPACE–TIME CODE. Let us&#10;consider a channel with and antennas at its transmitting and receiving&#10;end, respectively, and assume that transmission occurs over consecutive&#10;time instances. If , the channel is called SYMMETRIC, and otherwise&#10;asymmetric, which more precisely typically refers to the case . For the&#10;time being, a space–time code will just be a finite collection of&#10;complex matrices in . The channel equation in this multiple-input&#10;multiple-output (MIMO) setting is given by where is the received matrix,&#10;and is the SPACE–TIME CODE matrix. In the above equation, we adopt the&#10;Rayleigh fading channel model, I.E., the entries of the random CHANNEL&#10;MATRIX are complex variables with identically distributed real and&#10;imaginary parts, yielding a Rayleigh distributed envelope with scale&#10;parameter . We assume further that the channel remains static during the&#10;entire transmission of the codeword matrix , and then changes&#10;independently of its previous state. The additive noise[^2] is modeled&#10;by the NOISE MATRIX , whose entries are independent, identically&#10;distributed complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean.&#10;&#10;Let us briefly discuss what constitutes a “good” code. Consider a&#10;space–time code , and let be code matrices ranging over . Two basic&#10;design criteria can be derived in order to minimize the probability of&#10;error [@TSC].&#10;&#10;The DIVERSITY GAIN of a code is the asymptotic slope of the error&#10;probability curve with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio () in a&#10;scale, and relates to the minimum rank over all pairs of distinct code&#10;matrices . The minimum rank of should satisfy in which case is called a&#10;FULL-DIVERSITY code.&#10;&#10;The CODING GAIN measures the difference in required for two different&#10;codes to achieve the same error probability. For a full-diversity code&#10;this is proportional to the determinant&#10;&#10;We define the MINIMUM DETERMINANT of a code as the infimum as the code&#10;size increases, . If , the space–time code is said to have the&#10;NONVANISHING DETERMINANT property [@BR]. In other words, a nonvanishing&#10;determinant guarantees that the minimum determinant is bounded from&#10;below by a positive constant even in the limit, and hence the error&#10;probability will not blow up when increasing the code size.&#10;&#10;In 2003, the usefulness of central simple algebras to construct&#10;space–time codes meeting both of the above criteria was established in&#10;[@SRS]; especially of (cyclic) division algebras, for which the property&#10;of being division immediately implies full diversity. Thereupon the&#10;construction of space–time codes started to rely on cleverly designed&#10;algebraic structures, leading to the construction of multiple&#10;extraordinary codes, such as the celebrated Golden code [@BRV], or&#10;general Perfect codes [@ORBV; @ESK]. It was later shown in [@BR] that in&#10;a cyclic division algebra based code, achieving the nonvanishing&#10;determinant property can be ensured by restricting the entries of the&#10;codewords to certain subrings of the algebra alongside with a smart&#10;choice for the base field, and that ensuring nonvanishing determinants&#10;is enough to achieve the optimal trade-off between diversity and&#10;multiplexing.&#10;&#10;Further investigation carried out in [@HLL; @VHLR] showed that codes&#10;constructed from orders, in particular MAXIMAL ORDERS, of cyclic&#10;division algebras performed exceptionally well. The main observation is&#10;that the discriminant of the order is directly related to the offered&#10;coding gain, and should be as small as possible in order to maximize the&#10;coding gain.&#10;&#10;Maximal orders were then the obvious candidates, as they maximize the&#10;normalised density of the corresponding lattice and hence also maximize&#10;the coding gain. Unfortunately, they are in general very difficult to&#10;compute and may result in highly skewed lattices making the bit labeling&#10;a delicate problem on its own. Therefore, NATURAL ORDERS with a simpler&#10;structure have become a more frequent choice as they provide a good&#10;compromise between the two common extremes: using maximal orders to&#10;optimize coding gain, on the one hand, and restricting to orthogonal&#10;lattices to simplify bit labeling, encoding, and decoding, on the other.&#10;&#10;However, the current explicit constructions are typically limited to the&#10;symmetric case, while the asymmetric case remains largely open. The main&#10;goal of this article is to fill this gap, though our interest is not to&#10;analyze the performance of explicit codes. Instead, we focus on the&#10;algebraic setup and provide lower bounds for the smallest possible&#10;discriminants of natural orders for the considered setups, and give&#10;explicit field extensions and corresponding cyclic division algebras&#10;meeting the lower bounds.&#10;&#10;This article is structured as follows. In Section \[sec:stc\] we will&#10;shortly introduce MIMO space–time coding and the construction of&#10;space–time codes using representations of orders in central simple&#10;algebras. Section \[sec:nat\_orders\] contains the main results of this&#10;article. We will consider the most interesting asymmetric MIMO channel&#10;setups and fix or as the base field to guarantee the nonvanishing&#10;determinant property[^3]. For each considered setup , we will find an&#10;explicit field extension and an explicit -central cyclic division&#10;algebra over , such that the norm of the discriminant of its natural&#10;order is minimal. This will translate into the largest possible&#10;determinant (see and [@VHLR; @HL] for the proof) and thus provide us&#10;with the maximal coding gain one can achieve by using a natural order.&#10;&#10;[^1]: ’Time instances’ are commonly referred to as CHANNEL USES.&#10;&#10;[^2]: The noise is a combination of thermal noise and noise caused by&#10;    the signal impulse.&#10;&#10;[^3]: From a mathematical point of view, any imaginary quadratic number&#10;    field would give a nonvanishing determinant, but the choice matches&#10;    with the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) commonly used in&#10;    engineering.">

Thus, the considered codewords will be&#10;square matrices.">
  <outline text="Space–time lattice codes" _note="Very simplistically defined, a space–time code is a finite set of&#10;complex matrices. However, in order to avoid accumulation points at the&#10;receiver, in practical implementations it is convenient to impose an&#10;additional discrete structure on the code, such as a lattice structure.&#10;We define a SPACE–TIME CODE to be a finite subset of a LATTICE where is&#10;a LATTICE BASIS. We recall that a lattice in is FULL if . We call a&#10;space–time lattice code SYMMETRIC, if its underlying lattice is full,&#10;and ASYMMETRIC[^1] otherwise.&#10;&#10;Due to linearity, given a lattice and , This implies that any lattice&#10;satisfying the nonvanishing determinant property can be scaled so that&#10;achieves any wanted nonzero value. Consequently, a meaningful comparison&#10;of different lattices requires some kind of normalization. To this end,&#10;consider the Gram matrix of , where denotes the matrix trace. The volume&#10;of is related to the Gram matrix as .&#10;&#10;The NORMALIZED MINIMUM DETERMINANT [@VHLR] of is the minimum determinant&#10;of after scaling it to have a unit size fundamental parallelotope, that&#10;is,&#10;&#10;The NORMALIZED DENSITY [@VHLR] of is&#10;&#10;We get the immediate relation , from which it follows that in order to&#10;maximize the coding gain it suffices to maximize the density of the&#10;lattice. Maximizing the density, for its part, translates into a certain&#10;DISCRIMINANT MINIMIZATION PROBLEM [@VHLR; @HL], as we shall see in&#10;Section \[subsec:stc\_orders\] (cf. ). This observation is crucial and&#10;will be the main motivation underlying Section \[sec:nat\_orders\].&#10;&#10;[^1]: This definition relates to the fact that a symmetric code carries&#10;    the maximum amount of information (I.E., dimensions) that can be&#10;    transmitted over a symmetric channel without causing accumulation&#10;    points at the receiving end. In an asymmetric channel, a symmetric&#10;    code will result in accumulation points, and hence asymmetric codes,&#10;    I.E., non-full lattices are called for. See [@HL] for more details.">

  <outline text="Central simple algebras and orders" _note="We recall that a finite dimensional algebra over a number field is an&#10;-CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRA, if its center is precisely and it has no&#10;nontrivial ideals. An algebra is said to be DIVISION if all of its&#10;nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse. By [@SRS Prop. 1], as&#10;long as the underlying algebraic structure of a space–time code is a&#10;division algebra, the full-diversity property of the code will be&#10;guaranteed. It turns out that if is an algebraic number field, then&#10;every -central simple algebra is a CYCLIC ALGEBRA [@Re Thm. 32.20].&#10;&#10;Let be a cyclic extension of number fields of degree with respective&#10;rings of integers and , and cyclic Galois group . We fix a nonzero&#10;element and consider the right -vector space with left multiplication&#10;defined by for all , and . The triple is referred to as a CYCLIC ALGEBRA&#10;of INDEX .&#10;&#10;The obvious choice of lattices in will be its ORDERS. We recall that if&#10;is a Dedekind ring, an -order in is a subring which shares the same&#10;identity as , is a finitely generated -module, and generates as a linear&#10;space over . Furthermore, an order is MAXIMAL if it not properly&#10;contained in any other -order of . Of special interest in this article&#10;is the -module which we refer to as the NATURAL ORDER of .&#10;&#10;Throughout the paper, we will denote the relative field norm map of the&#10;extension by and the absolute norm map by . The restriction of this map&#10;to orders may be specified in the notation as and .&#10;&#10;If the element fails to be an algebraic integer, then will not be closed&#10;under multiplication. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition&#10;for an index- cyclic algebra to be division is that for all primes .&#10;This is a simple extension of a well-known result due to A. Albert, for&#10;more details and a proof see [@VHLR Prop. 3.6]. In what follows we will&#10;refer to such a non-zero element as a NON-NORM ELEMENT for .&#10;&#10;We recall that given a Dedekind ring and an -order with basis over , the&#10;-discriminant of is the ideal where denotes the reduced trace, which&#10;will be defined in .&#10;&#10;While the ring of algebraic integers is the unique maximal order in an&#10;algebraic number field, an -central simple division algebra may contain&#10;several maximal orders. They all share the same discriminant [@Re&#10;Thm. 25.3], known as the discriminant of the algebra . Given two -orders&#10;, , it is clear that if , then ). Consequently, for every -order in ,&#10;and the ideal norm is the smallest possible among all -orders of .">

  <outline text="Algebraic space–time codes from representations of orders" _note="Let be a cyclic division algebra of index . We fix compatible embeddings&#10;of and into , and identify and with their images under these embeddings.&#10;The -linear transformation of given by left multiplication by an element&#10;results in an -algebra homomorphism to which we refer to as the MAXIMAL&#10;REPRESENTATION. An element can be identified via with the matrix The&#10;determinant and trace define the REDUCED NORM and REDUCED TRACE of ,&#10;respectively. We may shortly denote and , when there is no danger of&#10;confusion.&#10;&#10;Next, given an order in , we may use the maximal representation to&#10;define an injective map . If the center of the algebra is quadratic&#10;imaginary and admits an basis, then is a lattice, and any finite subset&#10;of will be a space–time lattice code, in the literature often referred&#10;to as ALGEBRAIC SPACE–TIME CODE.&#10;&#10;Due to the algebra being division, the above matrices will be&#10;invertible, and hence any algebraic space–time code constructed in this&#10;way will have full diversity. Moreover, if , we have [@Re Thm. 10.1],&#10;guaranteeing nonvanishing determinants for or quadratic imaginary.&#10;&#10;We now relate the minimum determinant of a code to the density of the&#10;underlying lattice , which is the main motivation for choosing orders&#10;with small discriminant. If the center of the cyclic algebra is&#10;quadratic imaginary and the considered order admits an -basis, the&#10;volume of the lattice relates to the discriminant of the order as&#10;[@VHLR] where is a constant which depends on the center and . Thus, for&#10;fixed minimum determinant, the density of the code (cf. ) – and&#10;consequently the coding gain – is maximized by minimizing the&#10;discriminant of the order.&#10;&#10;\[exp:golden\] Let be a quadratic real extension of number fields with&#10;Galois group . Let be of class number 1 and , the respective rings of&#10;integers. We choose such that , and define the cyclic division algebra&#10;where . We consider the natural order of and construct an algebraic&#10;space–time code as a finite subset&#10;&#10;The choice of fields and element gives rise to the Golden algebra and to&#10;the well-known GOLDEN CODE [@ORBV].&#10;&#10;The above example relates to the symmetric scenario, I.E., it has an&#10;underlying lattice that is full. Full lattices can be efficiently&#10;decoded when , and the same lattice codes can also be employed when .&#10;There is no simple optimal decoding method for symmetric codes, however,&#10;when [^1].&#10;&#10;Building upon symmetric codes, we now briefly introduce BLOCK DIAGONAL&#10;ASYMMETRIC space–time codes [@HL], better suited for the asymmetric&#10;scenario. Let be a tower of field extensions with extension degrees , ,&#10;and , and with Galois groups and . We fix a non-norm element , and&#10;consider the cyclic division algebra Given any order in , we identify&#10;each element with its maximal representation and construct the following&#10;infinite block-diagonal lattice achieving the nonvanishing determinant&#10;property, provided that the base field is either or quadratic imaginary&#10;[@HL]:&#10;&#10;The CODE RATE [@HL] of a space–time code carved out from in (complex)&#10;symbols per channel use is We point out that is the maximum code rate&#10;that allows for avoiding accumulation points at the receiving end with&#10;receive antennas.&#10;&#10;In summary, in order to construct an algebraic space–time code, we first&#10;choose a central simple algebra over a suitable base field and then look&#10;for a dense lattice in it. This amounts to selecting an adequate order&#10;in the algebra. As motivated earlier, we will opt for natural orders as&#10;a compromise between simplicity and maximal coding gain.&#10;&#10;[^1]: Having too few receive antennas will cause the lattice to collapse&#10;    resulting in accumulation points, since the received signal now has&#10;    dimension . Hence, partial brute-force decoding of high complexity&#10;    has to be carried out.">

Consequently,&#10;&#10;Fortunately we can find ideals of norm 17 with the required properties.&#10;We fix (or ), so that the ray class field of conductor is precisely .&#10;Since is a prime ideal, all non-trivial characters of have conductor ,&#10;so that by the conductor-discriminant formula , . The absolute&#10;discriminant is . We choose and , and prove that this choice yields the&#10;smallest possible discriminant of a cyclic extension of degree 4 over .&#10;To that end, let be any ideal of of norm different from 17 for which ,&#10;and let be a subfield with cyclic of degree 4. Assume that . Since has&#10;conductor , by the minimality of the quartic characters of have&#10;conductor . The quadratic character could have smaller conductor, but it&#10;cannot be smaller than 3, since admits no ray class field of conductor&#10;with . Using the conductor-discriminant formula and as norms in are&#10;positive, we have and so Since , we have . But then necessarily , a&#10;contradiction to our assumption.&#10;&#10; Let , with a root of . A pair of norm-wise smallest primes in is , of&#10;respective norms 2 and 5. Consequently, (cf. ), so that will achieve the&#10;smallest possible value among all central division algebras satisfying&#10;the given conditions for a unit non-norm element . Unfortunately, as we&#10;will show next, there is no suitable unit in this case, forcing us to&#10;consider other non-norm elements.&#10;&#10; By the Hasse Norm Theorem, to show that an element in is not a norm, it&#10;suffices to show that it is not a local norm at some prime of . We need&#10;to produce a unit with , and since in an unramified local extension all&#10;units are norms, we consider the local extension corresponding to the&#10;ramifying prime . It is not difficult to verify that , and .&#10;&#10;Let and be the completions of and with respect to the discrete&#10;valuations associated to the primes of and of . Then is a totally and&#10;tamely ramified cyclic local extension of degree 2, with . Using , and,&#10;by Hensel’s lemma, an element in will be a non-norm element for if and&#10;only if its image in is not a square in .&#10;&#10;Since and the norm of every unit in is , we have . Consequently, the&#10;norm of the image in of every element in is a square. Over finite&#10;fields, this is the case if and only it such an image is itself a&#10;square, which for its part implies that every element in maps to and,&#10;hence, is in the image of the map . We conclude that there exists no&#10;unit which is a non-norm element for , forcing us to use to balance the&#10;sizes of and in in order to achieve minimality of .&#10;&#10;Since the norm of an element is the product of the norms of the prime&#10;ideals dividing , it is easy to verify that the smallest possible norm&#10;in is 4. We set with , which yields . In order to study the possible&#10;values of , let be any ideal of of norm different from 17, for which ,&#10;and let be a subfield of the ray class field , with cyclic of degree 4.&#10;&#10;The smallest possible norms for are given by&#10;&#10;Using , we see that , so that we only need to consider the cases for&#10;which , I.E., only the case .&#10;&#10;We compute . The smallest quadratic discriminant for an extension in&#10;which both and a prime of norm ramify is , corresponding to the&#10;extension . Thus, , with and . Consequently, for all , . By , we are&#10;done.&#10;&#10;\[thm:res4\] Let with and . Any cyclic division algebra satisfies . The&#10;lower bound is achieved for , and , where is a primitive root of unity&#10;and a root of .&#10;&#10;:&#10;&#10; We start by finding the smallest possible discriminant over for cyclic&#10;extensions of degree 6. We denote by , and cyclic extensions of degree 2&#10;and 3 over and their compositum, respectively. Using , and arguments&#10;similar to those used in Theorem \[thm:res3\], we deduce that the&#10;smallest possible cubic discriminant is , corresponding to the extension&#10;[@BeMOl Table p. 883, row 32], where is a root of the polynomial .&#10;&#10;Since we want to minimize , the use of , requires that we consider&#10;separately the cases where is and is not relatively prime to , and check&#10;which case yields a smaller value for this discriminant.&#10;&#10;. The smallest possible discriminant corresponds to the extension of ,&#10;with , of norm .&#10;&#10;. If for some ideal , the best possibility is , corresponding to the&#10;extension of with discriminant ideal . This choice yields[^1] , with .&#10;&#10;We conclude that the smallest possible discriminant over for cyclic&#10;extensions of degree 6 is , achieved in the extension . The involved&#10;rings of integers are and . The discriminants of the extensions involved&#10;are summarized in Table \[tab:disc\] below.&#10;&#10; A pair of smallest primes in is of norms 4 and 9, respectively, where&#10;is any prime above 2, and is any prime above 3. Consequently, (cf. ),&#10;and will achieve its smallest possible value for a unit non-norm element&#10;, .&#10;&#10; To simplify notation, we set, , and . We prove that the unit satisfies&#10;.&#10;&#10;The prime ramifies in the extension . Let be a prime of extending , and&#10;, be the completions of and with respect to the corresponding&#10;valuations, with .&#10;&#10;The local extension is a totally and tamely ramified extension of degree&#10;3. Since the image of the unit in the residue field is 4, which has&#10;multiplicative order 6, we deduce that . By and Hasse’s Norm Theorem,&#10;the theorem follows.&#10;&#10;\[thm:res5\] Let with and , and let be a cyclic division algebra. Then,&#10;with equality for and , where and with a root of the polynomial .&#10;&#10;:&#10;&#10; Let and be as in the statement of the theorem. By Theorem \[thm:res4\],&#10;the same choice of field ensures the minimality of the discriminant&#10;among all possible discriminants of cyclic sextic extensions over .&#10;&#10;Let . A pair of smallest primes in is , of norms and 13, respectively.&#10;Consequently, (cf. ), and the norm will attain its smallest possible&#10;value for a unit non-norm element .&#10;&#10; We encounter here the same situation as in Theorem \[thm:res3\]. On the&#10;one hand, since and the norm of every unit in is , every element in maps&#10;to a square in the residue field. On the other hand, , and tells us that&#10;consists of those elements in which map to squares in the residue field&#10;of any ramifying prime. Consequently, every element in is in the image&#10;of the map , and there exists no non-norm unit element for . We thus&#10;need to balance the sizes of and in to achieve minimality of . We&#10;observe that this argument holds for any choice of and , as long as and&#10;.&#10;&#10;We fix of norm , corresponding to the smallest possible norm in .&#10;Substituting into , we get . We conclude the proof by showing that for&#10;any other choice of and under the given assumptions.&#10;&#10;Any possible is of the form with or with ( could be equal to ) and . In&#10;the first case, by the minimality arguments in the choice of and , for&#10;all choices of and , and so .&#10;&#10;Suppose next that with and . As we saw in Step 1 of the proof of&#10;Theorem \[thm:res4\], the conductor of a cubic extension of is ideal of&#10;norm greater than 13 and such that is a multiple of 12. By the&#10;conductor-discriminant formula, the corresponding extension will have&#10;discriminant , and by the minimality in the choice of , for any&#10;quadratic extension of . Consequently, for all choices of . Now, We&#10;conclude that for all possible choices of and , and the theorem follows.&#10;&#10;[^1]: The factor comes from the fact that is tamely ramified and, thus,&#10;    has as discriminant the prime lying above 13 in .">

<outline text="Conclusions" _note="In this article we have introduced the reader to a technique used in&#10;multiple-input multiple-output wireless communications known as&#10;space–time coding. Within this framework, we have recalled several&#10;design criteria which have been derived in order to ensure a good&#10;performance of codes constructed from representations of orders in&#10;central simple algebras. In particular, we have explained why it is&#10;crucial to choose orders with small discriminants as the underlying&#10;algebraic structure in order to maximize the coding gain. While maximal&#10;orders achieve the minimal discriminant and hence the maximal coding&#10;gain among algebraic space–time codes, we have motivated why in practice&#10;it may sometimes be favorable to use the so-called natural orders&#10;instead. However, one should bare in mind that orthogonal lattices have&#10;yet additional benefits such as simple bit labeling and somewhat simpler&#10;encoding and decoding, so there is a natural tradeoff between simplicity&#10;and coding gain.&#10;&#10;For the base fields or imaginary quadratic (corresponding to the most&#10;typical signaling alphabets), and pairs of extension degrees in an&#10;asymmetric channel setup, we have computed an explicit number field&#10;extension and a non-norm element giving rise to a cyclic division&#10;algebra whose natural order achieves the minimum discriminant among all&#10;cyclic division algebras with the same degree and base field&#10;assumptions. This way we have produced explicit space–time codes&#10;attaining the optimal coding gain among codes arising from natural&#10;orders.&#10;&#10;A. Barreal and C.
