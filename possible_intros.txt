to a polymer phase in the vicinity of 350 K  .
Polymerisation occurs by a [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism,
leading to the formation of one-dimensional C-C bridged C 
chains  . The AC  polymers exhibit interesting
structural properties and form a variety of conducting and magnetic
phases. A metal-insulator transition below 50 K is accompanied by the
stabilisation of a magnetic state in RbC  and CsC , whereas KC  remains metallic to low temperatures  . The nature of
the magnetic transition has remained controversial, as both quasi-one
dimensional electronic instabilities   and three-dimensional magnetic
ordering   have been proposed. Initial X-ray powder
diffraction studies   have described the structure of the
polymers as orthorhombic (space group  ) with the orientation of
the C  chains about the short axis   described
by  =45 5 ,
where   is the angle between the cycloaddition planes and the   axis.
However, recent single crystal X-ray diffraction and diffuse scattering
studies   on KC  and RbC  have revealed that they
are not isostructural. They adopt different relative chain orientations
(Figure  ) and their crystal structures are described
by distinct space groups,   (orthorhombic) and  2/  (body-centred
monoclinic), respectively. The difference in their respective physical
properties can thus be attributed to the distinct relative chain
orientations. Moreover the angle   was determined as 51 
for KC  and 47  for RbC , the difference also

we construct the (pseudo)differential equation of the diffusion on the
smash line. This is further extended to non stationary random walks that
incorporate Hamiltonian dynamics into the diffusions processes.
Additionally a matrix realizations of the  -generators of the

follows from Bohr’s compound nucleus hypothesis  ,
that the decay of a heavy nucleus
has no memory of how it was formed. However, factorization is only
justified when the reaction takes place through discrete resonances
and there are many channels contributing to each decay mode. Otherwise,
the fluctuations in the widths of the resonance gives rise to the

Among many of great applications, such as the magnetically-assisted fast ignition approach  , the axial magnetic field would collimate the relativistic electron beam to increase the coupling efficiency between the laser and the core. Furthermore, the magnetically-assisted proton acceleration scheme was also proposed recently  , the axial magnetic field could not only collimate the relativistic electron beam but also enhance the electron heating efficiency in front of the target. Although several kilotesla field has been measured in a relativistically intense laser-plasma interaction experiment  , it is in small spatial and temporal scales, which is difficult in applications. Thanks to the landmark work performed recently  , extremely strong magetostatic field up to

However even so, this state-of-art strongest magetostatic field is still far smaller when comparing with laser field.</text>–Generation of space-uniform, time-stable and extremely-strong magnetostatic fields will be of great importance to plasma, beam physics and astrophysics
